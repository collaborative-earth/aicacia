Applying an adjustment vector to account for\nexpected changes in urban per capita emissions due to\nongoing technological changes should also avoid overestimation of the baseline emissions scenarios. Additionally,\nthe adjustment vectors adopt the geographic resolution of\nthe global model used. For example, Erickson and Tempest (2014) data include 14 regions; GCAM, 32 regions;\nand GECO, 38 regions.\n\nThe limitation is that using the population factor oversimplifies emissions drivers. Although adjustment factors\nshould account for ongoing technological changes, the\ndiversity of cities and the dynamic interrelationships\nbetween population, economics, energy efficiency, and\nother factors are still oversimplified. Additionally, there\nmay be cases where the regional population growth\nassumptions of the adjustment vector, inherited from\nregion definitions and assumptions of the global models\nselected, may overestimate or underestimate population\ngrowth rates based on country groupings. However, at this\nstage population is the most reliable and consistent type\nof data applicable across all Global Covenant of Mayors\ncities.

But today, we are depleting Earth\u2019s resources at\nrates that are not sustainable, endangering economies and people\u2019s\nlives. People depend on clean water, fertile land, healthy forests,\nand a stable climate. Livable cities and clean energy are essential\nfor a sustainable planet. We must address these urgent, global\nchallenges this decade.\n\n**Our vision**\n\nWe envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise\nmanagement of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where\nthe actions of government, business, and communities combine to\neliminate poverty and sustain the natural environment for all people.\n\n\n**Our approach**\n\nCOUNT IT\n\nWe start with data. We conduct independent research and draw on\nthe latest technology to develop new insights and recommendations.\nOur rigorous analysis identifies risks, unveils opportunities, and\ninforms smart strategies. We focus our efforts on influential\nand emerging economies where the future of sustainability\nwill be determined.\n\nCHANGE IT\n\nWe use our research to influence government policies, business\nstrategies, and civil society action. We test projects with communities,\ncompanies, and government agencies to build a strong evidence\nbase. Then, we work with partners to deliver change on the ground\nthat alleviates poverty and strengthens society. We hold ourselves\naccountable to ensure our outcomes will be bold and enduring.\n\nSCALE IT\n\nWe don\u2019t think small. Once tested, we work with partners to adopt\nand expand our efforts regionally and globally. We engage with\ndecision-makers to carry out our ideas and elevate our impact. We\nmeasure success through government and business actions that\nimprove people\u2019s lives and sustain a healthy environment.\n\n|Col1|Copyright 2023 World Resources Institute.

This working paper contributes to closing\nthis research gap.\n\nIn Bangalore, TIDE and WRI India have been running VR\nsince 2015.[2] Launched as a voluntary initiative in partnership with the local electric utility Bangalore Electricity\nSupply Company (BESCOM), participating households\nreceive customized HERs. As of December 2020, VR covered more than 5,136 households from six different parts\nof Bangalore. Participants represent a range of households, including homes from one to four bedrooms, homes\nwith one to seven occupants, and energy use ranging\nfrom very low (from 50 kilowatt hours [kWh] per month)\nto very high (from 180 kWh per month). TIDE and WRI\nIndia conducted a quasi-experimental study via a pre-post\ndesign analyzing the energy use data of over two thousand households in the VR program in order to assess the\nimpact of VR reports on participating households\u2019 energy\nsavings.[3] While this study does not include a control group\nin Bangalore, we do compare electricity consumption in\nour study sample to consumption in Karnataka, the state\nin which Bangalore is located.\n\nVR reports, like most HERs, provide customers with\npersonalized feedback as well as social comparisons and\nenergy-conservation recommendations. Specifically, VR\nreports provide basic information on current consumption, historical consumption, comparison to neighbors,\nactionable tips, and energy-savings goals. See Table ES-1\nfor an excerpt of the VR reports.\n\nIn addition to approaching the question of HERs\u2019 quantitative impact on energy savings, this working paper uses\nhousehold surveys and one-on-one interviews to explore\nthe specific aspects of the report that might be driving\nenergy-saving behaviors.\n\nWe provide suggestions to improve future versions of VR\nreports specifically and HERs generally. The findings and\nrecommendations in this working paper are relevant for\nboth electric utilities and policymakers considering how to\ndesign scalable behavioral interventions to reduce household energy consumption to sustainable levels without\nextreme taxation.",

The \u201cGoals for You\u201d section lays out\na potential energy-savings goal for the household in terms\nof kWh and in terms of the tariff rate associated with the\nhousehold\u2019s energy goal. The recommendations section is\ncustomized to each household based on an initial baseline\nsurvey and provides actionable suggestions like switching to LED lights. As one participant pointedly noted,\n\u201cThe recommendation section is clear, but other sections\ndon\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\n**We find suggestive evidence that the VR reports**\n**may have changed the way VR recipients pur-**\n**chased appliances.

Similarly, we find that the only\naspect of the VR report that is significantly correlated with\nenergy saving is respondents\u2019 confirming that they fol\n\nlowed the recommendations section of the VR report while\npurchasing appliances. The subsample of households who\nparticipated in the follow-up survey is relatively small (n\n= 118 out of 2,196 participants), but the patterns found\nare consistent with both the administrative and focusgroup findings.\n\nWhile our administrative data sample is relatively large (n\n= 2,196), we did not use a randomized control treatment\ndesign, nor were we able to obtain individual or aggregate\ndata for households without HERs; therefore, causality\ntesting on the effects of the reports themselves in Bangalore is limited.

Because the neoclassical model assumes rationality and full information, these strategies often assume\nthat people will be aware of pricing differences, will\nattune to new information, and will correct overconsumption accordingly.\n\nTraditional interventions have limitations. There is\nevidence that taxes on consumption must be relatively\nhigh to change behavior; some research indicates that\nachieving a 2 percent reduction in household energy use\nrequires raising energy prices by 11 to 20 percent, making them expensive for consumers and subject to public\npushback (Allcott 2011). These taxes are often regressive\n\n\n-----\n\nas they affect low-income consumers relatively more than\nhigher-income consumers. Smaller price shifts might be\nmore palatable but are likely to be ineffective because\nmany individuals fail to notice such small tax increases.\n(Chetty et al. 2009). Interventions that focus on information alone have limitations as consumers may fail to notice\nnew information or may not be able to process complex\ninformation (Marois and Ivanoff 2005); and there is evidence that, despite our best intentions, information does\nnot always translate into action (Sheeran 2003).\n\nRegulations like efficiency standards on appliances and\nresidential construction codes that mandate minimum\nlevels of building efficiency can also be effective policy\ntools. However, regulations may not always be politically feasible. And even when feasible and implemented,\nhuman behavior continues to play a critical role as people\ndetermine how much energy to consume, even if that\nconsumption is through an energy-efficient appliance or\nwithin an energy-efficient building.",

As\ndiscussed in detail in Section 1.4 (See Figure 10), this\ndynamic could be playing a role in the HER program in\nBangalore, as we found that below-average consumption\nhouseholds increased their consumption by 6 percent\nwhile high-consuming households decreased their energy\nusage by 12 percent.",

This\nworking paper aims to begin closing this research gap by\nconducting a quasi-experimental study of the VR program\nin India and yields three important implications for future\nresearch and policy on demand-side interventions.\n\nFirst, we find evidence that the energy savings associated\nwith HERs reported in prior research in U.S. contexts are\nsimilar in scale and applicable and achievable in India.\nSpecifically, we find a significant 7 percent decrease in\naverage monthly energy consumption per household from\npre- to post-VR participation. While this savings may\nseem modest at the individual household level, projected\nat scale in the state of Karnataka it translates to a savings\nof almost $60 million and more than 604 million kWh\neach year and reduction of 0.6 million tonnes of CO2.\nGiven the magnitude of potential impacts at scale, future\nadditional research, funding, and policy efforts focused on\ndesigning effective HERs would be well-placed.\n\nSecond, we find initial suggestive evidence that the\nactionable recommendation section of the VR report may\nbe more related to energy savings rather than the social\nnorm comparison section, which significant portions\nof our sample found to be unclear. We hope this initial\nhypothesis-suggesting evidence can be the starting point\nfor further exploration on the drivers of energy saving so\nthat future HERs can have an even greater impact. Indeed,\nwe see early evidence that the evolution of Indian HERs is\nalready under way. As a result of the research described in\nthis working paper, VR Lite was introduced in early 2021,\nusing these insights to redesign, condense, and clarify the\ncurrent HER report.[26]\n\nFinally, this study adds to a growing body of literature on\nthe importance of focusing on the demand side, or human\nside, of the consumption dilemma. This nuanced understanding of consumer perceptions as a tool to instill longterm behavior change is an increasingly integral part of\nWRI\u2019s work. WRI will continue to work with local partners\naround the world to conduct more behavioral interventions in the energy domain, building on our findings to\ndesign policies that lead to large-scale behavior change\nwith far-reaching implications for sustainability.\n\n\n-----",

First,\nthere was not a single supplier in Ghana that could offer an LCS 100% of her required drug inventory.\nDespite claims of comprehensive product lines, no distributor carried more than 60% of an LCS\u2019s needs,\nso LCS were constantly shopping from wholesaler to wholesaler to build their inventory.[23] Second,\nGSMFEL was unique in its commitment to serving rural areas and its promise to deliver to the customer\u2019s\nstore. Without GSMFEL, LCS would typically take a bus to an urban center in order to shop for products,\na costly process in terms of transportation, not to mention lost sales. In fact, a 2003 survey of 11 LCS\nfound that on average, they spent $227 a year on transportation to buy their inventory.[24] On top of these\nsupply chain improvements, GSMFEL promised franchisees the same credit terms, usually 30 days,\noffered by other distributors.\n\n**Improved training: Training turned out to be an even more powerful recruiting tool than the supply chain.**\nAlthough Ghana\u2019s 8,000 LCS vastly outnumber the country\u2019s doctors, LCS across Ghana feel as though\nthey have been marginalized, and that their services have been unrecognized relative to those of more\nhighly trained healthcare professionals. The opportunity to receive some degree of formal training\nappeals to most LCS both as a way of improving business performance as well as recognition of the\nimportant role each LCS plays in community health. CareShop offered extensive training spread over\nseveral weeks and divided into the following five modules:\n\n\n3 Sessions\n\n4 Sessions\n\n7 Sessions\n\n9 Sessions\n\n5 Sessions\n\n\nModule A:\n\nModule B:\n\nModule C:\n\nModule D:\n\nModule E:\n\n\nIntroduction to Franchising\n\nBusiness and Financial Management\n\nDrug Management\n\nClinical Services\n\nAction Planning",

At the conclusion\nof the first session, attendees would have the option to continue the training if they joined the CareShop\nfranchise. After the introductory session, a large portion of the attendees immediately recognized the\nvalue of continuation and signed up to join the franchise.\n\nAlthough the CareShop training manuals have over 500 pages, a few lessons from the training surfaced\nrepeatedly as favorites. First, franchisees valued that CareShop helped them to renovate the interior and\nexterior of their stores to look more attractive and professional to their customers. Second, they felt that\nthe training on product marketing techniques helped them to increase the average size of their\ntransactions. Third, franchisees appreciated basic health training because it enabled them to deliver\nhigher quality customer service and increased their confidence as informed health providers.\nFranchisees received training on how to diagnose and treat common diseases and how to recognize\ndiseases that require a referral to a health facility.

The following excerpt from GSMFEL company documents presents the contractual\nobligations of the franchisor and franchisee:\n\n**Franchisor commitments** **Franchisee commitments**\n\nIntensive initial training To undertake training\n\nRegular re-fresher and follow up training To undertake refresher and follow up training\n\nTo operate according to the rules and\nRegular supervision and monitoring regulations of the franchise\n\nA reliable supply of low cost, quality assured To buy commodity only from the Franchisor\ncommodities and to sell products at the agreed prices\n\nTo refurbish the shop according to franchise\nminimum quality requirements and use the\n\nFranchise brand name promotion/advertising franchise logos and standard layouts\n\nMentoring and support on all aspects of\nbusiness operation and pharmaceutical\npractice appropriate to the level of operation To pay franchising fees and royalties\n\nIn reality, CareShop franchisees maintain more autonomy than would be supposed from the franchising\nagreement. The exclusivity of the CareShop supply chain, in particular, has never been fully realized. It is\nsimply not economically or logistically possible for the franchisor to supply every brand of product that any\nof the over 270 shops may request. Without being able to supply every requested product, therefore,\nfranchisees have sometimes felt entitled to buy from competing channels. Rather than expending\nresources to enforce supply chain exclusivity, CareShop has wisely focused on trying to build franchisee\nloyalty through other means discussed below.\n\n**Cost of franchising: CareShop franchisees pay an initiation fee of \u00a215, or approximately $15. In**\naddition to the initiation fee, CareShop owners must cover the costs of store renovation and a portion of\ntheir training expenses. Renovation costs represent the bulk of conversion costs and could run into the\nhundreds of dollars depending on how extensively franchisees choose to renovate their stores.",

In fact, GSMFEL financial statements suggest that\nfranchisees have purchased a substantial share of their inventory from competing suppliers throughout\nCareShop\u2019s years of operations. According to the pro forma franchisee income statement above (Table\n3), an LCS could expect to purchase around $11,814 worth of products annually. However, even in\nGSMFEL\u2019s best year, 2004, it was only supplying around 15% of its franchisees\u2019 total product purchases.\nTable 4 estimates GSMFEL\u2019s average per customer sales by dividing annual turnover by GSMFEL\u2019s\nnumber of customers (see Appendix A).\n\n**Table 4: Average annual per customer sales (GH\u00a2)**\n\nYear 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\nSales per customer (CareShop and Allied) 1,403 1,451 1,019 929 298\n\nThe lack of supply chain exclusivity profoundly influenced GSMFEL\u2019s financial performance because\nGSMFEL would incur all the fixed costs of operating a full-fledged distribution service while only capturing\n15% of the potential revenue from product sales. Compounding their financial troubles was the fact that\nfranchisees were rarely paying GSMFEL on time if at all. As of June 2007, approximately 75% of\nfranchisees were carrying outstanding balances.\n\nGSMFEL has little leverage over franchisees to rectify these contractual transgressions. Without being\nable to offer marked product discounts, GSMFEL does not have a clear advantage over competing\nsuppliers, and franchisees have no reason to discard the relationships with suppliers that they had\ndeveloped prior to their conversion.\n\n|Year|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sales per customer (CareShop and Allied)|1,403|1,451|1,019|929|298|\n\n\n-----\n\nExternal challenges 23\n_What Works: CareShop Ghana_",

But evidence\nconnecting green space directly to increased physical activity\nremains mixed (Lee and Maheswaran 2011; Nieuwenhuijsen 2018). Evidence suggests green spaces may either have\na positive (e.g., Lachowycz and Jones 2011; Calogiuri and\nChroni 2014) or neutral (e.g., Hartig et al. 2014; Hankey\nand Marshall 2017; Kondo et al. 2018) effect on physical\nactivity. In one recent review, however, 18 out of 19 studies\nsuggested a positive effect of urban trees on levels of physical\nactivity (Wolf et al. 2020).\n\nBy providing shade, reducing exposure to air pollution, and\nenhancing aesthetic appeal, street trees might encourage\nactive transport (Figure 6; Kumar et al. 2019; Wolf et al.\n2020). Perceived safety, distance to destination, and presence\nof infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks, bike lanes) also drive decisions related to active transit (Hartig et al. 2014).\n\nUrban green spaces and large, mature trees have been\nassociated with reduced levels of crime, aggressive behavior, and other antisocial activities (Kondo et al. 2015; Wolf\nand Robbins 2015; Jennings et al. 2016; Wolf et al. 2020).\nAlthough evidence remains mixed, researchers have found\nlower crime rates related to characteristics such as street tree\ndensity, when controlling for other confounding variables.\nFor example, increased canopy cover has been associated\nwith reduced rates of homicide in Bogot\u00e1 (Escobedo et al.\n2018), and reduced rates of gunshot assaults in Philadelphia",

The presence of\ntrees may reduce the number of vehicle collisions (Lyytim\u00e4ki\net al. 2008; Wolf 2010; Van Treese et al. 2017). Trees may\nalso help to demarcate the edge of the road or create a barrier\nbetween vehicles and pedestrians (Mullaney et al. 2015).\n\nIn addition, urban and nearby forests create spaces for recreation and play (Tyrv\u00e4inen et al. 2005; O'Brien et al. 2017).\nForested areas in and around cities can host hikers, campers,\ntrail runners, birdwatchers, and provide space for children\nto engage in free play.

These charges perhaps provide a model for setting and adjusting the portion\nof the green tariff rate that is related to the network rather\nthan specifically to renewable energy generation.\n\nAt a minimum, a green tariff needs to account for the\nretirement of RECs associated with the supply to companies on this tariff, and could allow for companies to own\nthe RECs through a transfer. From a market perspective\n(RECs are a market based instrument) this resource pool\nis thus over and above any Renewable Portfolio Standard\n(RPS) requirements the utility must satisfy. Care should\nbe taken to discuss this \u201cover and above\u201d aspect of the\ntariff, as part of its adoption, so that the green tariff does\nnot inadvertently reduce any overall RPS requirements. It\nwill be important in this discussion to be clear that RECs\nprovide a market-based accounting for renewable energy\nrather than a physical accounting of the mix of power\ndelivered to a customer\u2019s facility.[27]\n\nWRI interviews have shown that some companies are\nconcerned that utilities will not procure a least-cost\nrenewable energy portfolio to support a green tariff, thus\nretail choice may be necessary or at least companies must\nbe closely involved in resource procurement. Innate pressure, and potentially rate design, may help mitigate this\nconcern. The utility green tariff is implicitly in competition with the other options companies could pursue\u2014from\nrelocating to self generating to advocating for an open\nmarket\u2014just as the utility\u2019s standard power offer is in\ncompetition with these options. Rate design could also\ndraw from performance ratemaking and innovations in\nenergy efficiency incentives. A rate could allow the utility\nto see some upside for delivering least-cost renewables to\ncustomers. However, this approach could also imply some\nrisk of a downside for the utility shareholder and thus be\nunacceptable to the utility.",

Since a utility, particularly one\nwith a large geographic footprint, could allow a green tariff\ncustomer to seamlessly shift its green tariff from meter\nto meter\u2014given that it is primarily an accounting transaction\u2014utilities could provide more flexibility than the\n\n\n-----\n\ninstruments companies use today.

Although\ncompanies may commit to buy the power and even commit to penalties for early withdrawal, after the scale of\neconomic upheaval in 2008, WRI found some regulators\nwere quick to question these companies are creditworthy. If there is not enough demand to cover the cost of\nthe renewable energy generation assets, regulators may\nrequire either the remaining green tariff customers or the\nutility shareholders bear the cost of those stranded assets.\n\nIn addition to declining buyout costs if a company exits\nearly, utilities should have a plan to sell power from the\nassets on a merchant basis to limit the actual losses (in\naddition to optimizing the economics despite the intermittent nature of the supply relative to real-time loads served\nby the tariff). If utilities cannot sell the power, they should\nconsider where it falls in their economic dispatch stack\nand when it would be wise for the remaining rate base to\nrely on it. For example, during peak summer use, a solar\n\n\nasset may be cheaper than another peaking power option.\nThough if this had to be done on a large scale, for some\nutilities this strategy may create a risk of stranding other\ngeneration assets through overcapacity.\n\nFinally, addressing the more catastrophic failures to pay\nthat regulators are concerned about after 2008, perhaps\ncustomers participating in the green tariff could pay a\nfraction of a penny for the first few years to create an\nindemnification fund. By reducing the risk that the cost of\nthe asset will not be recovered, the cost of the capital may\nalso be reduced. Once the fund reached a predetermined\nlevel or a level indexed to the risk of stranded renewable\nenergy assets, the fee would be removed from the tariff.",

A related key objective was to demonstrate\n\nthe value of midcentury strategies to inform the identification of\n\nnational commitments that were consistent with both the global\n\nclimate goal and national socioeconomic priorities.\n\nThe quantitative goals of the DDPP, grounded in the post-Copen\u00ad\n\nhagen, pre-Paris context, were based on a 50 percent chance of\n\nmeeting the 2\u00b0C target, with the IPCC AR5 and the IEA 2DS sce\u00ad\n\nnarios being used for guidance (see Table SPM.1 of the Summary\n\nfor Policy Makers in Edenhofer et al. 2014). The \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d\n\ntarget agreed to in Paris is a more stringent objective (Rogelj et al.\n\n2018; Rogelj et al. 2015a) but could be accommodated using tighter\n\nbenchmarks (see next paragraph) and wider emissions coverage\n\n(e.g., land use) in future DDP exercises (see Subsection 1.4).\n\nLocal research teams from 16 countries[2] were recruited, with\n\nwidely varying modeling capabilities and initial mindsets\n\nregarding domestic emissions reduction potential. The model\u00ad\n\ning teams were given the collective goal of keeping cumulative\n\nemissions under the IEA\u2019s 2014 2DS \u201c50% chance of 2\u00b0C\u201d carbon\n\nbudget. Each of the teams was asked to produce several long\nterm physical and economic maps to a 2\u00b0C future by backcasting\n\nfrom characteristics of the 2050 emissions goal. The teams were\n\nfree to establish their own scenarios consistent with the 2\u00b0C tar\u00ad\n\nget, but they were given guidance on the availability of key low\n\nemissions technologies (e.g., wind and solar generation, carbon\n\ncapture and storage, net-zero buildings, nonfoodstuff biofuels,\n\nvehicle and grid battery storage) based on global research and\n\ndevelopment and commercialization efforts. They were also giv\u00ad\n\nen a nonbinding benchmark of 1.7 metric tons CO2e per capita in\n\n2050.[3] In the end, some country teams came in above and some\n\nbelow the benchmark.",

Please\n\nsee the DDPP synthesis report for details (Deep Decarbonization\n\nPathways Project 2015).\n\nThe common reporting template, referred to as a \u201cdashboard,\u201d\n\nwas also used to describe the type and scale of sectoral chang\u00ad\n\nes and measure the physical investment in key technologies,\n\nequipment, and infrastructure. These were used in the global\n\nsynthesis report to derive global conclusions. As part of the final\n\ncountry reports, the teams were also asked to write up tech\u00ad\n\nnical and possible policy scenario storylines to describe what\n\nhappened in the scenarios in their jurisdiction. The teams then\n\nconducted varying levels of outreach in their home countries\n\n(see Subsection 1.3).\n\n\nThe collective teams\u2019 modeling results and storylines iteratively\n\nevolved through learning from each other and from the collec\u00ad\n\ntive results, until interim and final sets of results were published\n\nin September 2014 and December 2015 prior to Paris. The coun\u00ad\n\ntry team reports became part of their (widely varying) national\n\nclimate policy conversations and were influential in the policy\n\nprocesses of several countries (Subsection 1.3) (Argyriou et al.\n\n2016).

Prior to 2014, IDDRI was involved in a large, mul\u00ad\n\ntistakeholder French national debate on climate policy, and the\n\nSDSN was inspired by work on deep emissions reductions done\n\nby and for the state of California (Williams et al. 2012). The two\n\ninstitutions wanted to combine these experiences and insights\n\nat the global level in the lead-up to COP 21. The two institutions\n\njointly ran the process, trading management as appropriate to\n\nthe time and task. Overall funding for collective activities in\n\nthe project (secretariat, workshops, outreach) and to subsidize\n\nthe participation of some country research teams, notably from\n\ndeveloping countries, was largely provided by the Children\u2019s\n\nInvestment Fund for the Future and internal funds of the SDSN\n\nand IDDRI, but most of the developed country teams were\n\nself-funded except for travel to DDPP meetings. Modeling teams\n\nfrom 16 separate countries were recruited based on their capacity\n\nto explore deep decarbonization, with widely varying modeling\n\ncapabilities. While some worked with government, the teams\n\nchosen were deliberately not typically part of a UNFCCC negoti\u00ad\n\nating team (had they been, they would have likely simply revert\u00ad\n\ned to their official negotiating positions). While some teams\n\n\n-----\n\nwere involved with negotiations,[4] they deliberately kept these\n\nactivities separate from the DDPP process to allow for enhanced\n\nambition in the project.",

To varying extents in\n\ndifferent countries, it has succeeded in this aim (Argyriou et\n\nal. 2016). For many if not most of the DDPP countries, this was\n\nthe first full study broad and stringent enough to be called 2\u00b0C\n\ncompliant. As such, it went beyond what had been the normal\n\nscope of debate.\n\nThe U.S. DDPP report (Williams et al. 2014), prepared by Energy\n\nand Environmental Economics (E3), Lawrence Berkeley National\n\nLaboratory, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, pushed\n\nthe U.S. conversation on climate policy from incremental emis\u00ad\n\nsions reductions to wholesale transformation of the energy sys\u00ad\n\ntem to eventual elimination of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nand was highly influential in the formulation of the U.S. Mid\nCentury Strategy (White House 2016, 1\u2013111) under the Obama\n\nadministration. This momentum has continued at the state level,\n\nwhere much of the implementation power resides, and DDPs\n\nhave played an explicit role in policy discussions and policy\n\nformation in the states of California, Washington, Oregon, New\n\nYork, and the region of New England. DDPs have been developed\n\nby a number of prominent NGOs, business organizations, and\n\nelectric utilities, which also play an important role in U.S. policy.\n\nThe UK DDPP report (Pye et al. 2015) team (University College\n\nLondon Energy Institute) developed the integrated energy mod\u00ad\n\nels used by the UK government and the UK Committee on\n\nClimate Change (CCC) for the analysis underpinning the UK\n\nClimate Change Act 2008, which legislated for a long-term 2050\n\ntarget. It was used in subsequent analyses in 2012 and 2016 for\n\nthe interim targets for the period between now and 2050.

That said, a review of the literature along with interviews with 17 food industry organizations and experts revealed a group of common environmental, social, ethical, and economic attributes associated with \u201cbetter meat.\u201d The literature also shows that alternative agricultural production systems and practices are often mentioned in the context of \u201cbetter meat.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 shows the attributes associated with \u201cbetter meat\u201d in\nthe literature and our interviews.

However, as detailed in Chapter 3\nof this report, links between these alternative production\nsystems and practices, and their effects on the attributes in\nFigure 1, can be complex.\n\nBecause \u201cbetter meat\u201d is loosely defined, different\nstakeholders may interpret it differently. Our interviews\nconfirmed that \u201cbetter meat\u201d can have different meanings\nacross organizations. This is particularly problematic in\nrelation to broader sustainability priorities: without a\nclear definition, companies may simply define \u201cbetter\u201d in\na way that fits their own current sourcing patterns, and/\nor to mean something very narrow, which poses a risk of\ngreenwashing.

To analyze the environmental\nattributes of terrestrial animal proteins, we build on Poore\nand Nemecek\u2019s (2018) meta-analysis, which looked at LCAs\nof the production of dozens of food products across more\nthan 38,000 farms in 100 countries. The studies included\nin this meta-analysis were based on real farm data (rather\nthan relying fully on models or simulations). Using these\nLCAs, Poore and Nemecek (2018) constructed a database\ncontaining four of the quantitative environmental indicators\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 (GHG emissions, land use, water\nuse, and water quality). Because our analysis is focused on\nthe Global North, where \u201cless and better meat\u201d is a relevant\nsustainability strategy, we used data points from North\nAmerica and Europe only in this report.[2] We started by\nextracting weighted-average values for North America and\nEurope for each of the four environmental indicators by\nanimal protein type (beef, lamb, dairy, pork, poultry, and\neggs), calculating impacts per kg of protein produced.[3] Table\n2 shows these data, with two common plant-based sources of\nprotein (soy and pulses) for comparison.[4]\n\nWe recognize that LCAs primarily provide data on\nenvironmental (rather than social, ethical, and economic)\nindicators. Furthermore, LCAs generally do not yet account\nfor certain indicators, such as on-farm biodiversity and\nsoil health, which are closely related to the farm-level",

The\nstudy authors noted that the increases in emissions, land\nuse, and water pollution per kg of beef under the grass-fed\nsystem were primarily due to the absence of low-fiber and\nhigh-energy feed ingredients (e.g., maize) that are fed to\nthe cattle in feedlots during the final months of their lives.\nThis difference in feed led the grass-fed cattle to have a\nslower growth rate than the feedlot-finished cattle, which\nin turn led to higher emissions from digestion and manure\nproduction throughout the animals\u2019 lives in the grass-fed\nsystem than in the conventional system.

(2018) note that both feedlot-finishing and grassfinishing beef production systems follow similar management\nin the earlier stages of beef production, namely the cow-calf\nand backgrounding stages. To make this \u201cpaired study\u201d\u2014\nwhich only focused on the finishing stage of beef production\u2014comparable to other studies on our list, we added GHG\nemissions from the cow-calf stage (18.4 kg CO2e per kg beef\nproduced) and backgrounding stage (2.2 kg CO2e per kg beef)\nfor the U.S. Midwest from Rotz et al. (2019), Table S8. This\nadjustment raises the emissions of the grass-finishing system\nfrom 9.62 kg CO2e per kg beef, as reported in Stanley et al.\n(2018) for the finishing stage, to 30.22 kg CO2e per kg beef for\nthe full life cycle. It thus suggests that neither of the beef production systems in Stanley et al. (2018) were \u201ccarbon-negative\u201d\nwhen accounting for the full life cycle; instead, the high level\nof soil carbon sequestration in the finishing stage (which led\nto removals of \u221216.27 kg CO2e per kg beef) appear to offset 54\npercent of the emissions of 30.22 kg CO2e per kg beef in the\nfull life cycle.\n\n\n-----",

The slower decision making processes of\nindividual participants can hold up group action.\nBecause TCSP was the first pilot of commercial\ncollaborative solar purchasing, the timeline was not\nentirely predictable. Based on this experience, the\nfollowing actions are keys to mitigating timing risk:\n\n\u00b3\u00b3 Early on (i.e., at the solar workshop and in initial\nrecruitment) the convener highlights key timing\ncontingencies such as foreseen changes in available\nincentives or policies.\n\n\u00b3\u00b3 The convener establishes a timeline for the group to\nwhich all participants commit going into Step 5.\n\n\u00b3\u00b3 The timeline is approved by decision makers in Step\n5 so that the process timeline can be clearly specified in\nprocurement documents in Step 6.\n\n**Preparatory Research and the RFI**\nParticipants expressed interest in issuing a joint RFP\nby May 2008, but not enough was known about how\ndevelopers would view such a concept, what terms\nto expect (i.e. pricing), and whether those would be\nattractive given the prices that companies were paying\nPG&E for electricity. WRI performed additional\n\n\nresearch on the solar market, pricing, feasibility\nindicators, and business models. Participants needed\nfurther information in order to commit to a set of\nterms that they jointly expected would be attractive and\nfeasible. The RFI was undertaken as a complementary\npiece to research already completed on solar technology\nand to get developer feedback on how to shape the\neventual RFP. This is not to say, however, that it needs to\nbe repeated in other future efforts at collaborative solar\nprocurement. The results of the RFI indicated that the\nscale of solar purchase affects the cost for participants in\nseveral unique ways.\n\nSeven RFI responses were received, and they indicated\nthat the model could drive cost savings in some areas,\nespecially in labor for installation as well as reducing\nthe transaction costs associated with operations and\nmaintenance and the PPA. Figure 7 illustrates responses\nfrom solar industry representatives about where they\nexpected savings via aggregation of sites, based on their\nown cost structures for installation.

In a winner-take-all election the\nwinning slate sits on the council for a five-year term. The slates fill three fourths of the\ncouncil. The remaining one fourth of the representatives are chosen by a general council\nof state-organized producer and marketing cooperatives and associations (such as youth\nand women). The winning council then elects a president from among its members.[59]\n\nGiven this system of elections, villagers often feel that rural councils do not\nrepresent them. Rather, they represent political parties and the cooperatives.[60] Villagers\ndo not get to choose candidates and few parties have the resources to organize local\ngovernment slates. So there is little competition in local elections.[61] As one villager (in\nKoumpentoum, June 1994) explained: \"the Councilors are chosen by Deputies in the\nNational Assembly.

The Councils are chosen by the parties.\" Hesseling writes, based on her\nresearch in Senegal in 1983, that councils \"\u2026are at times nothing more than sections of\nthe Socialist Party [the party in power]....\"[62] Indeed, in 1994 the ruling Socialist Party\ndominated over 300 of Senegal's 317 rural councils. In short, the elections in Senegal are\nnot structured to create a downwardly accountable rural council.\n\nThe Forest Service agents, who retain most powers over forest use and\nmanagement, are upwardly accountable to the Regional and National Forest Services.\nThere are no formal mechanisms that make them accountable to rural councils or rural\npopulations. Any disputes over forestry-related matters (including even disputes with\nforesters) are officially referred to the local foresters and can be appealed to the Director\nof the National Forestry Service. These disputes cannot go to an independent judiciary.\n\nFurther, the private bodies to which the rural council chooses to give commercial\nproduction opportunities will be accountable to the rural council, and to the Forest\nService. Both the councils and Forest Service have the ability to revoke or not renew\naccess to these productive opportunities. These private bodies are also accountable to the\nForest Service by dint of the Forest Service\u2019s power to sanction.",

Although some publicly accessible\nimagery was used to observe large-scale features like the\nAmazon rainforest, its spatial resolution was insufficient\nto capture the finer features present in urban environments. For example, the Moderate Resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS), launched by NASA in 1999,\nhas a maximum spectral resolution of 250 meters, and so\ncannot meaningfully capture even a sizeable roadway\u2014a\nfour-lane road is still only about 10 meters wide (NASA\nn.d.). Distinguishing land use, as opposed to land cover, is\nnot practical at this resolution, at least within urban areas\nwhere the scale of the features is often much smaller.\nContemporary commercial imagery offers superior spatial\nresolution, but its high cost and low spatial coverage often\nintroduce major challenges. Because most commercial\nsystems typically acquire imagery on demand, many areas\nare ignored or seldom captured, posing challenges for\ntime-series analysis; compounding this, fewer satellite\nvisits means fewer chances to acquire cloud- and shadowfree imagery. Ground-truth (see Box 2), which represents\ndefinitive information about the precise location and\nnature of features on the ground, has also been in short\nsupply. The sheer volume of imagery and ground-truth\n\nBox 2 | What Is Ground-Truth?",

For example, the European Union\nEnergy Initiative defines minigrids as small-scale\nelectricity generation from 10 kW to 10 MW,\nand microgrids as 1 kW to 10 kW systems, while\nSE4All\u2019s High Impact Opportunity seeks an\ninclusive definition, which simply differentiates\nthe minigrid sector from stand-alone household\nsystems and grid-extension approaches.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, we define microgrids\nas off-grid networks between 1 kW and 100 kW\nthat serve retail customers using any technology,\nincluding biomass, diesel, or hydro. The type of\ntechnology can have a significant influence on the\ncharacteristics of microgrids and the services they\nprovide, which we explore below.",

However, due to poor reliability of\nthe national grid, some consumers switched back\nto Desi Power. To power other appliances, such\nas additional lights, fans, radios, and televisions,\npeople began to steal electricity or violate their\nconnection restrictions. Desi Power decided to\nchange its model to allow multiple appliances, and\nstarted charging a monthly tariff on a \u201cper-watt\u201d\nbasis. More recently, Desi Power has selectively\nintroduced a smart metering system in villages\nwhere the company has expanded service (outside\nthe geographical scope of this study).\n\nOriginally, two biomass systems, of 11 kW and 50\nkW, served Baharbari. In 2014, Desi Power ended\nits operation of the 50 kW system and introduced\nsolar PV and battery banks to supply some households. This switch was motivated by the inability to\nsustain the high load factor (65%) needed to make\nthe biomass system viable.\n\nDesi Power has made use of the MNRE subsidy for\nbiogasification technology (see Section Off-grid\n_policy environment in India) for a few of its systems._\nHowever, of greater importance to the long-term\nviability of the microgrid business has been the low\nnumber of credit-worthy commercial customers\nwho can finance the equipment that would run on\nelectricity. Notably, according to the Desi Power\nCEO, it is not the financing of the electricity connection fee itself, which is typically only a few hundred\nrupees (according to the household survey), but the\n\n\n-----\n\ncost of electro-mechanical equipment (higher by several orders of magnitude) that inhibits commercial\nentrepreneurship, and in turn limits the exploitation\nof electricity for livelihood development.",
        "ece3ad42-80b5-4933-b2f8-6fec4592fe7b": "###### Hybrid/competing microgrid penetration\n\nSolar PV/battery systems have replaced biogasifiers\nas the microgrid supply source in a number of\nvillages. This is likely driven by the need for biogasifiers to maintain a 60\u201365 percent load factor\nif they are to remain profitable. It is interesting\nthat both Desi Power and Husk Power replaced the\nbiomass supply source with solar PV/battery banks\nin low load-factor conditions. However, it is too\nearly to determine whether this shift has proven\ncommercially viable.\n\nIn some villages in both districts in Bihar, dieselbased microgrids were found to be operating,\nsometimes in competition with larger microgrids.\nFor example, in the village of Gayari, where Desi\nPower serves commercial but not residential\ncustomers, we surveyed 60 households that were\nserved by local diesel-based microgrids. In one of\nthe sites supplied by Husk Power, we found that its\nPV microgrid was competing with a diesel-based\nmicrogrid in the same market place.\n\n\nIt may have been the case, therefore, that households selected in the random sampling process\nreceived power from either a PV or a diesel-based\nmicrogrid. While the survey questions cannot reveal\nthe technology supplying the microgrid, they do differentiate grid service from microgrid service. The\nlatter differentiation is critical for this study, while\nthe technology isn\u2019t a particular focus. Undoubtedly, however, the technology has an influence on\nservice conditions, as this section aims to reveal.\nThis study is therefore somewhat restricted in its\nattribution of findings to biomass-based microgrids,\ndue to these confounding cases.",

This included a review of the leading scientific industry and CSO reports and networking with leading OBP-related initiatives like the UN Environment's Clean Seas Initiative and scientific experts such as the University of Georgia\u2019s New Materials Institute. Working with the founding member companies, NWP agreed to an initiative charter. The charter established the shared vision of building the first global network of OBP supply chains, defined the core principles for how members engage with each other, specified how member companies would meet their individual targets, how collective action would work to build an OBP supply chain, and how the partnership\u2019s ambitions aligned with the SDGs. The charter informed NWP\u2019s clear target of diverting 25,000 metric tons of plastic by the end of 2025.|When establishing the program, Unilever and DFID conducted an assessment of what type of social enterprises they should be supporting and what their overall systems change objective and underlying goal should be. Together with Altai Consulting, TRANSFORM mapped a theory of change that demonstrated how strategically supporting social enterprises could reach a designated program target of enabling 100 million people to access products and services that improve their health, livelihoods, environment, or well-being by 2025, and how that target would lead to the ultimate systems change objective of reducing poverty by scaling market-based solutions.|Since Courtauld began in 2005, the partnership has taken an iterative and adaptive management approach to developing its understanding of the UK food and beverage supply chain and its strategic plan. With each commitment in the series, the partnership established clear and simple targets grounded in research, but with a vision toward the next commitment. For example, Courtauld 1 had two package-reduction targets, but the partnership also started researching the food waste issue and developing targets for Courtauld 2. This allowed the partnership to build credibility, to improve its systems understanding over time (rather than investing too many resources up front), and to create champions within member companies and the external supporting environment.",

We also\nconsider how development objectives are integrated in climatechange planning in Ethiopia. The authors conducted a literature\nreview of studies examining the concept of mainstreaming\nclimate considerations into national planning and development\npolicies (see Appendix A).\n\nA framework for analysis was then adapted from an approach\ndescribed in Chuku (2010) as a basis for a qualitative assessment\nof how climate change has been mainstreamed into Ethiopia\u2019s\nkey national development plans. We assessed each plan against\na qualitative set of questions to determine how well the plan\nmet the four criteria for effective mainstreaming as described\nby Chuku: long-term environmental effectiveness (assessed ex_ante), equity considerations, cost-effectiveness, and institutional_\ncompatibility. The results of this assessment reflect the authors\u2019\nsubjective expert views.\n\nWe collected data and information via a desk review of primary\nplanning documents; data were also gathered through key informant interviews and focus group discussions to shed new light\non mainstreaming efforts and national planning processes.\n\nWe reviewed key national planning and report documents to\nassess how climate change was mainstreamed in the national\ndevelopment planning process. Table 1 provides a summary of\ndetails of the plans examined in this study. We reviewed the text\nof each plan for specific examples that answered key questions\nfor each of the four framework criteria (see Section 3.1).\n\nIn addition to the qualitative assessment of the plans, we interviewed three key informants to collect primary data about the\nperceived integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation into Ethiopia\u2019s national planning. The interview questions\nwere prepared and asked by the authors with follow-up questions as needed depending upon the interviewees\u2019 responses\n(see Appendix B). The interviewees were identified and selected\nbased on their extensive experience working with the CRGE\nand development planning process, their level of engagement",

Although\nsocial protection has been presented\nhere as a policy conclusion in its\nown right, it is also part of a risk\ngovernance approach. Risk governance needs to be promoted through\nnormative approaches, in dialogue\nbetween partner countries, and by\nbeing central to aid policies. A special case needs to be made for those\ncountries that are high risk, but with\nlimited institutional or governance\ncapacity to protect their populations.\nHere, a special role must be assumed\nby international and multinational\norganizations that sometimes have\nto replace government institutions in\nfragile states.

INTRODUCTION: DEFINING\n LOW-CARBON TRANSFORMATION\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange, the world must limit global warming to 2 \u00b0C\nrelative to pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014a) to avoid the\nworst impacts of climate change (World Bank 2012a).\nRealizing this limit will require massive reductions in\nGHG emissions, on the order of 40 percent to 70 percent\nbelow 2010 levels by 2050, and near net zero emissions by\n2100 (IPCC 2014a). If the world is to have a likely chance\nof staying below 2\u00b0C warming, emissions in 2020 should\nnot be higher than 44 GtCO2e. Based on current trajec\u00ad\ntories, however, they are expected to be 52\u201354 GtCO2e\n(median estimates) (UNEP 2014). Responding to the\nurgency and huge scale of the climate change challenge\nwill require a fundamental transformation in our political,\neconomic, social, and energy systems, in order to transi\u00ad\ntion to a low-carbon energy world.\n\nIn economics, transformation typically refers to structural\nchange in the relative importance of economic sectors as\na country\u2019s economy, society, and institutions modern\u00ad\nize and as resources shift to more productive sectors and\nactivities (Breisinger and Diao 2008). More broadly,\ntransformation is generally considered a long-term fun\u00ad\ndamental shift in a system, whether political, economic,\nsocial, or biological (see Table 1). Transformations are\ntypically viewed as multi-actor, multi-scale processes,\nwhere the change is highly non-linear (Box 1).\n\nThe word \u201ctransformation\u201d is frequently used in the cli\u00ad\nmate change context. For example, the Clean Technology\nFund of the Climate Investment Funds seeks to \u201cfinance\ntransformational actions\u201d through a set of \u201ctransforma\u00ad\ntional investments\u201d in the power sector, transportation,\nand energy efficiency (CIFs 2008).",

Starting in 1994, the government required\nall municipalities to technically map and designate land\nwhere wind development would be permitted and, in\n2008, required each municipality to set aside areas to\naccommodate 150 MW of wind capacity. Planning deci\u00ad\nsions for smaller wind turbines up to 150 meters high are\ndevolved to municipal governments and, since 2010, a\nWind Turbine Secretariat has supported municipalities\nwith the planning process. Offshore wind is the respon\u00ad\nsibility of the Danish Energy Agency, which publishes\ntechnical maps designating sites suitable for offshore\ndevelopment, and liaises with other authorities to stream\u00ad\nline the process for attaining approvals and licenses. This\nhas reduced transaction costs for developers and removed\nmany barriers to offshore wind development (Danish\nEnergy Agency 2009).\n\n\nDenmark has taken decisive steps to ensure grid access for\nwind. The transmission grid is entirely owned by Energi\u00ad\nnet.dk, a public company controlled by the Ministry of\n\n\nClimate and Energy. This has allowed grid expansion\nand upgrades to align with the national energy policy to\npromote wind. Most onshore wind is connected directly\nto the local distribution grid, with distribution system\noperators required to share the costs with developers.\nGrid connection of offshore wind is entirely financed by\nEnerginet.dk and passed on to the consumer through\nelectricity bills (Cochran et al. 2012). Denmark has one of\nthe fastest grid connection procedures for wind in Europe,\nwith an average lead-time of 2.1 months compared to the\nEU-wide average of 25.8 months (EWEA 2010).\n\nDenmark\u2019s experience with wind has not been without\nproblems, some of which are unique to a country with\nan unprecedentedly high share of renewable generation.\nAs the size and cost of wind turbines have increased, so\ntoo has public opposition, although such voices remain a\nminority.

First, the\nWCD built upon a history of global commissions\nthat have sought either to reconcile economic\ngrowth and environmental sustainability (such as\nthe Brundtland Commission and the Stockholm\nand Rio Conferences) or to address North-South\ninequalities and questions of justice (such as the\nBrandt and South Commissions). Indeed, the WCD\nmarked a step forward by incorporating at once the\nthemes of social justice, human rights, ecological\nsustainability, and development in its work.\n\nSecond, the dams arena illustrates the growing\nability of transnational civil society networks to\ncontribute to global public policy agendas. The\nWCD was formed as a result of national and\ninternational civil society protest against large\ndams, which was often directed at such multilateral\nagencies as the World Bank.[2] The high transaction\ncosts created by civil society dissent persuaded the\nWorld Bank and selected allies in international\nfinance and industry that a new approach was\nrequired to move the dams debate forward.\n\nThird, the WCD stood out from previous commissions in its diversity\u2014including pro-dam lobbyists\nand anti-dam protesters\u2014rather than limiting\nitself to participants from a broad middle ground.\nBy the standards of global commissions generally,\nit also marked a notable departure from the\n\u201ceminent persons\u201d model of distinguished public\nservants. It comprised, instead, active practitioners\nwhose personal legitimacy derived from their\nprominence in international stakeholder networks.\n\nFourth, the WCD was one of many government,\nprivate sector, and civil society dialogues on\ndevelopment policy that have proliferated since the\nlandmark UN Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. By including a broad range of stakeholders, the WCD was a\nleading example of a \u201cmulti-stakeholder process.\u201d\nBy including multiple perspectives, integrating\ndiverse viewpoints early in a policy process, and\nbuilding constituencies for implementation, multistakeholder processes are intended to provide a\nmore inclusive and pragmatic form of policy\nformulation.[3] Some consultative processes involving civil society, business, and governmental actors\nhave a direct input into policymaking.[4] However,",

This period also saw the\nthe fledgling United Nations General Assembly\nformulate and adopt the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\n\nAlthough the UN was conceived as, and remains,\npredominantly a forum for inter-governmental\nengagement, it also provided space from its\ninception for consultation with non-state actors.",

Third, the global fora described above\u2014\nwith the exception of the Trilateral Commission\u2014\nwere designed to affect the actions of world\ninstitutions and structures.\n\nYet, the impact of most global commissions has\nbeen slight. The Brandt and South Commissions\ncame out with concrete recommendations that\nwere not implemented. The Brundtland Commission succeeded in popularising the term \u201csustainable development\u201d and raising popular awareness\nof issues at the environment and development\ninterface, but resulted in few concrete changes. The\nStockholm and Rio Conferences were more\nsuccessful. The first resulted in a new and important UN agency, and the second served as a catalyst\nfor a series of important global environmental\nnegotiations, whose future is still not assured. The\nthree recently concluded sectoral commissions, on\nforests, oceans, and water, have yet to demonstrate\nany lasting effects.\n\nFinally, distinguished individuals have dominated\nglobal commissions, with eminence being almost\nsynonymous with high-level experience in government and intergovernmental bodies. Indeed, the\nsame individuals have served on many of these\ncommissions, as a few examples illustrate. Willy\nBrandt chaired his own commission and established\nthe Commission on Global Governance. Maurice\nStrong was Secretary-General of the Stockholm and\nRio Conferences, first Secretary-General of the UN\nEnvironment Programme, and served on the\nBrundtland Commission and the Commission on\nGlobal Governance. Sridath Ramphal was SecretaryGeneral of the Commonwealth, a member of the\nBrandt, Palme, Brundtland, and South Commissions, and co-chaired the Commission on Global\nGovernance.

Not surprisingly, this complexity has led to more\ntransboundary networks, national and local movements, and international organisations. These\nnetworks have pushed the boundaries of the\nconventional agendas of international intervention\nfrom those minimal processes of consultation to\ntransnational networks playing a role in agenda\nsetting, influencing official discourse and specific\npolicies, and changing the behaviour of governments.[58] In the process, transnational alliances have\nplayed a growing role in redefining who should sit\nat the table and what the agenda should be.\n\nOf considerable relevance to the WCD is the\nhistory of civil society organising to increase\nmultilateral development banks\u2019 (MDBs) accountability to civil society in both borrower and donor\ncountries.[59] From the early 1980s, this \u201cMDB\n\n\n-----\n\nCampaign\u201d has deployed a range of tools, including media education, protests in donor and\nborrower countries, lobbying key officials (senior\npoliticians, administrators, and World Bank\nExecutive Directors), and hearings in European\nparliaments and the U.S. Congress.
