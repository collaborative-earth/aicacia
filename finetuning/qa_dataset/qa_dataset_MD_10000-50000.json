What we\ncan also see, however, is that human\nsettlement\u2014human incursions into the Amazon\ntend to take on a life of their own.

With our\npartners, this program recognizes the\ninternational environmental reach of the Amazon\nand it also accommodates the legitimate\naspirations of Brazil\u2019s most impoverished.\n\nWhat these incomparable set of maps, and the\naccompanying report show, however, is that while\n\n\nHUMAN PRESSURE ON THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON FORESTS\n\n\n-----\n\nthere is more than sufficient unspoiled area in the\nAmazon to meet our preservation goals, we must\nbe vigilant to the pressure on the Basin that\nradiates out from settlements, and, as importantly,\nthe impact of isolated development that disrupts\nintact ecosystems and does damage in ways we\nhave yet to fully understand. These maps paint a\nstark and compelling picture.\n\nBrazil is acutely aware of the dual responsibility\nthat nature, geography, colonial exploration, and\n\n\nstatecraft have placed upon it. It does not shirk its\nunique obligation to the world community that the\nspecial circumstance of the Amazon Basin\ndemands. Nor does Brazil intend to shirk its duty\nto its people to provide them with the opportunity\nfor better, productive lives.\n\nBalancing those enormous demands requires\nwise choices and the tools and information to\ninform those choices.

The remaining third is found in\nmore isolated locations, indicating fires caused by\nshifting agriculture carried out by traditional\n_mestizo communities or indigenous populations._\nForests in these areas may be subjected to less\nintensive pressures such as hunting, harvesting of\nnon-timber forest products, and selective logging.\n\nThere are overlaps between fire zones and\nother indicators of human activity:\n\n  - With areas affected by selective logging,\nincluding the location of half of the selective\nlogging permits issued by the Brazilian\nGovernment;\n\n  - With the location of informal roads\n(identified from satellite imagery) in the\nnorthern portion of Mato Grosso and\nSouth-Central Par\u00e1.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002 the number of annual\nforest fires nearly doubled from 22,000 per year to\nalmost 43,000 per year, showing an acceleration of\nincipient human activity.\n\n**Areas Licensed for Mineral Exploration.

Fire zones can also flag logged\nforests into which wildfires escaped from\nnearby deforested areas. In summary, this\nzone is a crude indicator of areas under\nincipient pressures from hunting, small\ndeforestation, forest fires, and logging.\n\nThe validity of using the 10-km threshold\nwas tested when examining the relationship\nbetween human pressure, roads, and logging\n(see below).

The 2000s saw the introduction of naturebased solutions (NbS) in the international policy arena. NbS\nare a broad concept referring to working with nature to tackle\nchallenges such as climate change, food security, water scarcity,\nor disaster risk management. It serves as an umbrella concept\nfor a range of natural resources governance approaches that have\npreexisted or have since emerged that are all rooted in nature, as\ndistinguished from conventional or hard infrastructure (Pauleit\net al. 2017). This paper surveys four approaches nested within\nNbS that are relevant to agriculture: natural climate solutions\n(NCS), forest landscape restoration (FLR), ecosystem-based\nadaptation (EbA), and payment for ecosystems services (PES)\n(hereafter, NbS when referred to collectively). NbS approaches\n\n\nare complementary and not mutually exclusive. For example,\nNCS and FLR interventions may include an EbA component\nand vice versa, whereas PES are mechanisms that can be used to\nsupport or incentivize NCS, FLR, and EbA initiatives.\n\nGender is a key consideration in approaches and solutions to\ntackle climate change (Elias et al. 2021). Women and men\nexperience climate impacts differently based on factors that\ninclude differences in access and reliance on natural resources\nand ecosystems and socially constructed roles and responsibilities (FAO 2017). The gender-differentiated impacts are\nparticularly pronounced for rural women (FAO 2017; Deering\n2019). In rural communities around the world, local norms and\ndistribution of work shape women\u2019s unique roles in domestic\nand productive uses of natural resources (Onzere et. al. 2020;\nUNEP 2021). Often the primary collectors of water, fuelwood,\nand nontimber forest products (NTFPs), women are integral to\nthe effective management of fast-depleting natural resources and\nthe ecosystems services (ES) that they support (UNEP 2021).\nAs subsistence producers, female farmers play key roles in soil\nconservation, fertility, and enrichment (FAO 2019). Women\u2019s\nleadership in managing natural resources can yield many positive environmental and social results.",

Agriculture is a major cause of deforestation\nand, by extension, many related impacts, such as biodiversity\nloss, desertification, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide\n(CO2) (Geist and Lambin 2002; FAO 2021). Unsustainable\nagricultural practices and land uses have contributed to the\nmoderate and severe degradation of up to 52 percent of agricul\n\ntural lands (Iseman and Miralles-Wilhelm 2021). It is estimated\nthat if this trend continues, 95 percent of Earth\u2019s land areas will\nbe degraded by 2050 (GEF 2022). This would impact about\n3.2 billion people worldwide, most directly rural communities,\nsmallholders, and the extreme poor (GEF 2022). Women are\nparticularly vulnerable because they represent the majority of\nthe world\u2019s poor and are more dependent on natural resources\nfor their livelihoods (Osman-Elasha 2012; UN Women 2022).\nWomen compose 43 percent of the agricultural labor force\nworldwide and play critical roles in food production in developing countries (Doss et al. 2018; Viana 2021). Nature-positive\nproduction practices are essential to ensure food security, not just\nfor women and rural communities but also the entire world. This\nsection surveys four NbS approaches relevant to agricultural\nadaptation to climate change and their gender linkages.",

Established in 2009 in western Kenya, where\nsmallholder agriculture is the primary economic activity but\nwhere soil fertility is depleted, the project\u2019s goal is to sequester\ncarbon through sustainable agricultural land management\npractices (SALM) while increasing soil fertility and improving\nsmallholder food security.\n\nDuring implementation, the project found that women faced\nseveral barriers to participating and benefiting from the project:\nlack of land rights, lack of time to participate in required trainings, and lack of voice in their households and communities. The\nproject adopted a strategy for gender integration that involved\nfield staff intentionally seeking out women, offering special\ntraining sessions for women, and working with women to help\nthem exercise decision-making independently on certain SALM\npractices. The project also helped form village savings and loan\nassociations (VSLAs) to increase access to financial capital\nand help women with enterprise development. A subsequent\nsurvey showed that 78 percent of men and 67 percent of women\nperceived positive impacts from the project. Women reported an\nincrease in farm resources, such as manure and crop residue that\nincrease soil fertility, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.\nThey were able to adopt enterprises such as poultry raising\nand kitchen gardens that provided them discretionary income.\nMany women reported feeling more independent through their\nparticipation in the project and perceived that the opportunity\nto demonstrate their farm management skills created an opening\nfor more equitable social norms. Many of the men interviewed\nsaid they were now more willing to listen to women (World\nBank 2014; Lee et al. 2015) (see Appendix E for project profile).",

The project\u2019s overall goal is to protect the region\u2019s\nnatural capital and unique biodiversity while improving farmers\u2019\nincomes through agroforestry and NRM systems. The planning\nprocess began with a baseline gender and social analysis. This\nwas followed by gender training for all project staff and implementing partners on the ground to enhance skills in gender\nsensitivity and integration and use gender indicators to monitor\nprogress and measure results of the project activities. AgFor\nSulawesi set a target of at least 50 percent women participating\nand/or benefiting from the project activities and outcomes. The\nproject ensured gender balance in the staff and assigned female\nstaff for interviews on sensitive issues about which a woman\nmight not talk to a man. The project data and results were disaggregated by gender. After five years, results show that women\u2019s\nparticipation significantly increased at the farm level while the\ngroundwork was laid for advancing women\u2019s representation and\nleadership at the community level (Mulyoutami et al. 2012;\nCGIAR 2016) (see Appendix E for project profile).",

EbA is contrasted to\ntraditional, hard-engineered infrastructure such as sea walls\nand levees to combat flooding or irrigation infrastructure for\nagriculture (Seddon et al. 2016).\n\nEbA spans many of the same land management strategies in\nNCS and FLR, with an emphasis on helping smallholders\nadapt to climate change, such as through crop diversification\nwith indigenous varieties that are resistant to climate variability, sustainable management of grasslands and rangelands\nto increase resilience to drought and flooding, and training\nactivities to enhance knowledge on ecosystems use for climate\nadaptation (Vignola et al. 2015; SCBD 2019). EbA practices\nbenefit smallholders in multiple ways, including through the\ncontinued provision of key ES on which farming depends (e.g.,\nsoil and water conservation, nutrient regulation, natural pest\ncontrol, and pollination), more diversified and resilient production systems, and improved food security. EbA practices also\ncontribute to climate mitigation either by reducing the amount\nof GHG emitted from agricultural systems or increasing overall\nfarm biomass (Vignola et al. 2015).\n\nResearch suggests that women and men prioritize different ES.\nWomen often place more value on regulating services such as\nair purification and water regulation, whereas men prioritize\nprovisioning services such as agriculture (Fortnam et al. 2019).\nHowever, women\u2019s knowledge may not be valued in the same\nway as men\u2019s and therefore may not be effectively utilized in\ndecisions around the use and management of ES (Daz\u00e9 and\nTerton 2021). Some women may also lack the knowledge to\ndeal with the uncertainties brought about by climate change.\nA study in South Africa found that rural women, faced with\nshrinking crop yields, are abandoning their subsistence agriculture and turning to chopping down trees to make products they\ncan sell to meet household food security. But while they earn\nincome from the sale of products, their activities perpetuate their\nvulnerability linked to natural resource degradation and scarcity\n(Masinga et al. 2021).",

First among these is that our analysis\nrelies heavily upon publicly-disclosed information. Not\nonly is this relevant in terms of determining what is in\nour sample of approved and pipeline projects, but our\nanalysis and tagging of projects is contingent on the\nclarity of the project documents themselves.\n\nThe units of our analysis are the number of projects and\nthe amounts of finance directed toward components\nwithin projects. The number of projects is based on\nprojects that include both the banks\u2019 own resources as\nwell as those financed from bank-administered trust\nfunds.\n\nProjects often involve multiple components, so we drew\nfrom project documents to ascertain, whenever pos\u00ad\nsible, financing amounts assigned to each component.\nWe found that this breakdown was typically clearer for\nthe banks\u2019 own resources, thus our finance figures focus\nmore narrowly on the banks\u2019 own resources.[12] Some\nprojects did not involve any of the banks\u2019 own resources,\nso the project sample for the estimated volume of\nfinance does not exactly correspond to that of the proj\u00ad\nect number analysis.\n\nWe depended on each MDB\u2019s respective sector tags to\nhelp identify the pool of projects for our project-level\nanalysis. Thus, the dataset for energy supply projects\nexcludes indirect investments (for example, through a\n\n\nfund or on-lending arrangement) that are not explic\u00ad\nitly tagged as energy-related by the MDBs themselves.\nTransactions through financial intermediaries constitute\na significant share of the private sector activity of MDBs\nand are also the most opaque in terms of the underlying\nportfolios for such transactions (further discussion on\nthis in Sections 3 and 4). Our project-level analysis also\nexcludes projects that involved crosscutting market or\ninfrastructure programs unless energy was also explic\u00ad\nitly a sector or subsector tag. Due to this combination of\nfactors, our analysis likely underestimates energy supply\ninvestments supported by the MDBs.\n\nAlthough we include findings from our review of policy\nloans, technical assistance, and capacity-building activi\u00ad\nties in our project-level analysis, we found it difficult\nto apply the 2-degree alignment framework to these\ntransactions due to their more fluid or sectoral nature.\nThese transactions are not included in our overall sum\u00ad\nmary figures of the alignment of energy supply project\nalignment.",

To better assess**\nphysical risks, investors need more comprehensive, easily\naccessible asset-level data. Unlike transition risks, which\nare more policy-driven and less geographically specific,\nphysical risks, including water-related risks, affect specific\n\n\n-----\n\nlocations in very different ways. Asset-level data provide\ninformation about both physical and nonphysical assets\ntied to company ownership information. This can include\nasset locations, as well as other key characteristics. As\ndemonstrated in this paper, access to these types of data\nallows for the disaggregation of a company\u2019s assets so that\nthey can be analyzed at the geospatial level and linked\nto physical risks. Although asset-level data are available\nfrom certain databases or financial data providers, there\nis much more room for data quality and usability improvement (Connell et al. 2018).\n\nIn addition, this methodology relies on the ability\nto isolate the financial results of the companies\u2019 power\nsegments. This is not always possible for more diverse\ncompanies, and segment reporting could be improved.\nA survey by CFA Institute (2018) showed that only\n13 percent of investors are satisfied with current\nsegment disclosure.\n\nWe encourage thermal power companies to disclose\nmaterial climate-related risks and their financial impacts\nin alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD. We\nalso encourage them to disclose information on additional\nwater risk-related indicators highlighted earlier in this\nsection as well as key asset-level data: historical drought\nimpacts, power plant water withdrawal intensities and\ncooling technologies, and power plant locations. In due\ntime, we hope that increased disclosure of physical risks\nallows analyses like the one in this paper to be completed\nwith greater ease and accuracy.\n\n**Regulators can facilitate the disclosure of climate-**\n**related risks. The methodology outlined in this paper**\nrelies on outage and rate-of-sale data collected by the CEA.\nThese types of data are not available on a global basis.[48]\nTo better understand the exposure of thermal power\nplants to water-related risks at the global scale, regulators\nin other markets should collect outage and rate-of-sale\ndata from companies and make them available to the\npublic in a user-friendly format.",

As the United States has urbanized, young\npeople and money have flowed to urban areas, where jobs\nand educational opportunities tend to exist, while the\nrural workforce has grown older and less able to access\nlucrative jobs (Andrews and Reiblich 2020).\nSimultaneously, traditionally rural industries like farming,\nmining, and manufacturing have seen workforces shrink\ndue to mechanization and globalization. Boom-and-bust\ncycles and the transition toward low-carbon energy\nproduction have also left rural fossil fuel workers and\ncommunities with shrinking economic opportunities\n(Kopparam 2020). The closure of coal-fired power plants,\nfor instance, has adversely impacted local communities,\nmany of which are in rural areas, that rely on coal plants\n\n\nfor tax revenues and jobs (Morris et al. 2019). Adding to\neconomic pain, rural wages have stagnated for the past 50\nyears across all skill levels and demographics (Ziliak\n2019).\n\nRural households, and particularly low-income\nhouseholds, have higher energy costs, but many cannot\nafford to invest in energy efficiency upgrades such as\nweatherization or efficient appliances that can bring\nsavings. Rural households have a median energy burden\u2014\npercentage of income spent on energy\u2014of 4.4 percent,\ncompared with 3.3 percent for urban households, and\nlow-income households face energy burdens almost\nthree times greater than high-income households (Ross\net al. 2018). Electric cooperatives, which serve much of\nrural America, are often strapped for cash, hindering\ninvestment in clean energy programs that can benefit their\ncommunities.\n\nIn addition, climate change has already begun to affect\nrural livelihoods. Changing precipitation and temperature\npatterns are impacting crop growth and distribution of",

Box 7 highlights the efforts of\nSlum/Shack Dwellers International (SDI) to elevate\nthe role of slum communities across the continent.\nIn Rwanda, the International Council for Local\nEnvironmental Initiatives (ICLEI) undertook risk\nand vulnerability assessments in three districts\nand found that incorporating the lived experiences\nof community members was critical to filling data\ngaps often encountered in African cities (ICLEI\n2019). In Zambia, the regulator established\n\u201cwater watch groups,\u201d where consumers monitor\nwater and sanitation services and providers at a\ncommunity level (Nwasco n.d.). In Lilongwe and\nMaputo, community residents are utilizing creative\napproaches, such as participatory videography,\nto capture everyday realities (Rusca 2018). With\nAfrica\u2019s lack of historic data availability, there is still\na nascent understanding of the effects of climate\nchange at the regional, city, and neighborhood\nlevels. The current lack of such nuanced data is a\nmajor hindrance, not just in addressing the urgent\nneeds of water access but also in contingency\nplanning for shocks and climate change adaptation\n(discussed further in Section 2.2).",

        "741d3ae0-4c06-4ebe-8dd2-5f1097866d8e": "###### The Need for This Study\n\nInvestment decisions are generally guided by financial\nanalyses. A financial model typically considers cash\noutflows, such as investment, operating costs, taxes, and\ninterest on loans, and inflows, including revenues or\ntax benefits, rebates, and any income from rent. These,\nalong with the time value of money, indicate the financial returns on the investment; when positive and high\nenough, they make for a lucrative investment. However,\nthis model assumes a world in which power generation\nonly interacts with the larger society and environment in\nterms of cash flows. In reality, power generation is deeply\ninterconnected with various aspects of human life and\nthe environment. In addition to the utility of generating\nand providing power for productive purposes, a power\nplant can significantly impact several socioeconomic\nand environmental aspects of society due to its lifetime\nof 20\u201325 years. This is in addition to the impacts across\nthe upstream and downstream value chain, including the\nmining of resources, the manufacturing of equipment, and\nthe disposal of waste products and equipment at the end\nof operational life. However, market prices and decisionmaking based on financial analysis fail to capture such\nimpacts. Given India\u2019s vision for sustainable economic\ngrowth and its developmental priorities, considerating\nsuch impacts can strengthen decision-making, policy planning, and progress toward meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\n\n-----\n\nConventional power dominates Indian grid capacity (MoP\n2020). Whereas gas, lignite, and diesel make up only 8\npercent of the total installed capacity, coal accounts for 54\npercent, making it the most prominent power-generation\ntechnology in India (MoP 2020). With a domestic shortage of crude oil and natural gas and low efficiencies with\nlignite, coal\u2014which is cheap and readily available\u2014is also\nexpected to be the primary fossil fuel\u2013based technology in\nthe Indian electricity supply in the near future. Even with\ndecreasing prices for RE, coal features among the most\ncompetitive fuel sources of power generation in India.\nHowever, these prices do not reflect the costs of negative externalities from coal power generation, including\nthe health costs of air pollution from particulate matter\nreleased from the combustion of coal (Barreira et al. 2017;\nCAT and Urban Emissions 2017; Guttikunda and Jawahar\n2014; Mahapatra et al.",

However,\nunlike IRR, ERR includes important societal benefits (e.g.,\nenvironmental and health impacts) that enable decisionmaking based on an economic perspective where societal\nbenefits and cost are considered.\n\nA brief overview of the framework is illustrated by Figure\n2. The first step of the framework involves identifying the\nobjectives of assessing the SD impacts of RE technologies (Step 1). This allows users to select the relevant RE\ntechnologies to be assessed and the baseline scenario\n(Step 2). The next step includes selection of the relevant\nimpact categories and indicators for the analysis (Step\n3). Based on these, users can undertake the next steps\nto quantify the impacts (Step 4) and assign an economic\nvalue that reflects the value of socioeconomicand environmental costs and benefits of the RE technologies (Step 5).\nThe final steps include transparently reporting assessment\nresults (Step 6) as well as reporting impacts not included\nin the ERR estimation due to a lack of data or methodology to assess the impacts or assign an economic\nvalue (Step 7).\n\nFigure 2 | Overview of Steps",

But in general, most of the\ncommunities believed that Shell had addressed their most\nimportant concerns regarding employment, alternative\nlivelihood, and health and environmental impacts.\nRecently, however, plant safety has become a concern.\nAlthough safety training sessions have been conducted\n\n\nWRI: DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT CONFLICT\n\n\n-----\n\nfor the communities, there is continued apprehension\nwith regard to whether this training is adequate. Some\ncommunities have requested more training, along\nwith additional security to watch over the complex and\npipelines. According to the communities interviewed\nin Batangas City, these requests are still pending Shell\u2019s\nresponse and action. Local community leaders, while\ngenerally satisfi ed with their relationship with SPEX and\nPSFI on the Malampaya project, still express their view\nthat Shell needs to be more transparent and accessible.[72]\n\n_Offshore Pipeline Route. Three options were considered_\nfor the offshore pipeline route during the initial stages\nof the project (see Figure 2). Two options would have\nrouted the pipeline entirely offshore; the third, leastexpensive option, would have crossed Mindoro Island.[73]\nAt fi rst, the project sponsors preferred the third option\nfor cost reasons. But as a result of initial environmental\nassessments and informal community interviews,\nShell learned that the overland route through Mindoro\nwould traverse and heavily impact some areas of rich\nbiodiversity, and that one of the offshore routes would\ncross the ancestral waters of the indigenous Tagbanua\ntribe. Initial interviews with community members\nraised the environmental and social impacts of the other\nroute options. Shell ultimately rejected these routes in\nfavor of a mainly offshore route that avoided the most\nsignifi cant environmental and social impacts of the other\ntwo options, and therefore averted potential community\npressure in the affected areas.[74] This route, however, was\nthree times more expensive than the other two options.[75]\n\n_When Things Go Wrong. SPEX accounted for community_\nconcerns as they arose by revising its public engagement\nplan on an ongoing basis. For instance, SPEX initially\nfailed to engage the Pearl Farmers\u2019 Association located\naround the project area in Palawan.",

Additionally, nearly half of states do not allow end**\n**users that build onsite projects to sell excess power back to**\n**the grid.[59] Onsite, distributed generation projects (as opposed**\n**to large utility projects), such as wind and solar, can result in**\n**a mismatch between the power generation and consumption**\n**of a facility.[60] Thus, failure to provide compensation for the**\n**excess power generated during peak generation times signifi\u00ad**\n**cantly increases the cost of distributed generation projects.**\n**Compensation is most commonly provided by net metering**\n**policies, whereby the utility agrees to buy back excess power**\n**from distributed energy projects at a predetermined price from**\n**the end user. The American Council on Renewable Energy**\n**(ACORE) cites Oregon as a good example of best-practice**\n**interconnection and net metering standards[.61 ]**\n\n**PRICING POLICY**\n**A barrier to scaling-up use of onsite renewables is the wide**\n**variation in rate structures across service territories and the**\n**lack of a common format for reporting these tariffs to consum\u00ad**\n**ers. This adds to the transaction costs of doing site assessments**\n\n\n-----\n\n**to identify facilities that would be good candidates for onsite**\n**renewable energy projects.

EVs**\nare, on average, two to three times more energy efficient\nthan traditional internal-combustion engine vehicles.\nAlthough the improved efficiency alone contributes to\nsignificant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,\nthe energy sources on the grid, or the grid mix, used for\ncharging determines the overall emissions. As electricity\ngeneration continues to transition toward carbon-free\nsources, electric transportation can provide even greater\ncontributions toward decarbonization goals.\n\n**Large energy users, particularly those with renew-**\n**able energy procurement goals, are increasingly**\n**interested in using clean energy sources to meet**\n**new EV demand and are establishing goals to push**\n**these efforts forward. Goals are typically designed to**\ncover new EV loads associated with fleet vehicles and in\nsome cases EV loads associated with employee workplace\ncharging or public charging, such as at retail stores.\n\n**Aligning EV charging with the availability of**\n**renewable energy generation can also provide**\n**benefits for the grid, particularly in areas that cur-**\n**rently have or anticipate having large amounts of**\n**solar or wind generation on the grid. Programs that**\nencourage customers to charge midday, such as through\nworkplace charging, can align well with peak solar output;\nnighttime EV charging can align well with the availability\nof wind generation.",

This working paper explores the range of\napproaches and emerging program designs currently\nbeing used in the United States to match EV loads and\nrenewable energy, with an emphasis on methods that\nmore closely link the timing and location of the EV\ndemand with renewable energy supply. On the basis of\nearly experience with these programs (and where data\n\n\nwere available), this paper examines the structure of these\nofferings, pricing, the link between customer charging\nand the availability of renewable source power generation, and customer response. The objective is to inform\nboth customers seeking choices and utilities interested in\noffering programs about the range of different approaches\navailable, lessons from experience to date with utility\nprograms, and considerations for program design and\nimplementation.",

Utility Offerings That Shift Charging Times and Provide Access to Renewable Energy\n\nIn an effort to match the timing of renewable energy generation and EV charging, some utility programs have been\ndeveloped to encourage EV charging at times that are better for the grid, either during off-peak periods or at times\nwhen renewable energy generation is high. In exchange\nfor charging during these preferential times, utilities offer\ncustomers discounted rates, which can offset any potential\npremium for renewable energy.",
        "0ac15ece-16c6-4de0-8f81-3cae41cfc211": "From July 2015 to December 2016, BMW and PG&E ran Phase 1 of a\nmanaged charging pilot program\u2014known as ChargeForward\u2014to\ndemonstrate the technical feasibility and grid benefits of controlled EV\ncharging. During this time, BMW was required to provide PG&E with\n100 kW of grid resources when necessary, through a combination of\ndelaying charging for 100 BMW i3 vehicles and drawing from a secondlife stationary battery system, for one hour.\n\nThroughout Phase 1, 209 demand response events totaling 19,500 kWh\nwere dispatched. On average, 20 percent of the grid resources were\nfrom the 100 participating EVs and 80 percent came from the energy\nstorage system. The vehicle response rate was highly correlated with\nPG&E\u2019s residential TOU rates, which offer lower electricity prices at night\nfrom 11 PM to 2 AM. PG&E reported that a high percentage of EV drivers\nplugged in their vehicles as soon as they got home but delayed actual\ncharging until later in the evening, when rates declined. Ultimately,\nthis showed that the vehicles had flexibility as a grid resource, given\nthat they were plugged in for longer periods of time and customers\neffectively responded to the rate structure.\n\nIn Phase 2 of the pilot program, BMW aligned its EV charging with\nPG&E\u2019s forecasted renewable energy generation peak period. To do this\nsuccessfully, PG&E provided BMW with daily projections of renewable\nenergy generation a day in advance in order to optimize charging\nand maximize the amount of renewables that were used to power\nparticipating vehicles.\n\nIn a survey conducted by BMW and PG&E, customers interviewed\nwere 68 percent more likely to participate in a managed charging\nprogram if presented with the option of charging EVs with solar or wind\nenergy. This number dropped significantly to less than half (41 percent)\nwhen participants were told they would need to adjust their charging\nto the core daytime hours (9 AM to 4 PM) to take advantage of solar\nenergy. However, the presence of an additional monetary incentive\n(such as lower off-peak rates) approximately doubled the likelihood of\nparticipation from 41 percent to 83 percent, indicating a clear interest\nin charging with renewable sources in exchange for an additional\nmonetary incentive.\n\n\n-----\n\nBox 11 | \u0007SDG&E\u2019s Power Your Drive Program (California)\n\n\nBox 12 | \u0007Dutch Consortium\u2019s Solar-Controlled V2G",

This outcome points to the need for a more cohesive and consistent national policy framework to ensure that financial incentives are aligned with energy efficiency goals.\n\nSeveral of the ESCOs that we surveyed pointed out that many of the Energy Conservation\nAct\u2019s policy measures had never been carried out. Specifically, they cited the lack of help\nwith financing solutions\u2014one of the BEE\u2019s tasks\u2014as a major barrier to their growth. The\nECA also mandated the use of state energy conservation funds, but they also have not been\navailable in many states, even seven years after the act was passed.[44] Although the act\nrequires state designated agencies to produce twenty-two deliverables with limited technical\nand financial assistance, it does not have the capacity to implement these measures. To\nresolve this problem, state agencies may need to look for public\u2013private partnerships for\nquicker assistance, as well as better implementation and accountability.\n\nThe Indian National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), released in 2008, charts the\nlikely future direction of energy efficiency policies. The plan names \u201cenhanced energy efficiency\u201d as one of eight national missions to address the impact of climate change in India.\nIt proposes initiatives to accelerate the shift to energy efficient appliances through tax\nincentives (such as an accelerated depreciation of up to 80 percent in the first year and a\nlower VAT on EE equipment), mechanisms to help finance demand side management (DSM)\nprograms in industrial sectors, and innovative financial instruments to enhance energy efficiency. The plan addresses some of the inconsistencies in national policy, for example, recommending the elimination of fertilizer subsidies. It also discusses technology improvements for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which would offer incentives to such\ncompanies to use ESCOs in their energy efficiency projects. Most important, the plan recommends mandating lower energy consumption in large, energy-consuming industries and\nfacilities and the establishment of a market-based mechanism to make energy efficiency\nprograms more cost-effective. This would be done by certifying energy savings above those\nmandated and enabling the companies to trade their excess savings.",

Analysis of Energy Efficiency Projects\n\nIn this section we describe three successful energy efficiency projects carried out in India.\nTwo of them are companies that collaborated with an ESCO to save energy through performance contracting. The third is an energy efficiency project implemented by a company\nwithout an ESCO. We selected these examples to highlight common trends in the Indian\nESCO industry. Then, in the following section, we discuss the lessons learned from these\ncase studies.\n\n**LILAVATI HOSPITAL PROJECT IMPLEMENTED BY SUDNYA INDUSTRIAL SERVICES**\n\n_Company Details: Lilavati Hospital is one of the largest multispecialty hospitals in India,_\nwith state-of-the-art medical and research facilities. The building houses several energyintensive activities, like laundry and sterilization. The central air-conditioning system was\nthe biggest consumer of electricity, accounting for more than 60 percent of the hospital\u2019s\nenergy usage.\n\n_Project Details: The impetus for the project came from the hospital\u2019s senior managers, who_\nwere eager to implement energy-efficient measures to reduce energy costs and optimize\ntheir central air-conditioning and building services. The vice president of operations, Mr.\nPrakash Mhatre, introduced the ESCO, Sudnya Industrial Services, to the management. The\nhospital conducted a survey of its utilities and an energy audit of its facilities and then\nasked Sudnya to help provide turnkey solutions for energy savings through a pilot project,\nlinking the remuneration to Sudnya to the savings achieved.\n\n\n**Box 3.

In some instances, the overlap accounting may be\nquite straightforward. For example, in the case of duplicate\ntargets, for example, where a region and a city located within the\nregion sign onto the same commitment platform, these targets\ncan be interpreted as fully overlapping (Graichen et al. 2016).\nAlternately, an assessment may include measures taken by cities\nand companies in separate emissions sectors, and impacts are\nexpected to be fully additional rather than overlapping (Vargas\n\n\net al. 2021). In some cases, users may face a situation where a\nsingle actor has multiple actions and, given the high potential\nfor overlap, may decide to include only the most ambitious\naction (defined by emissions scope, coverage, and reduction\npotential). However, several studies include large numbers of\nactions, many of which overlap to varying degrees and require\nmore complex assumptions.\n\nAssumptions regarding overlap can be divided into those related\nto the specific data or proxy factors used as a basis for evaluating\noverlap and the degree of overlap between NSA actors (e.g., full\noverlap, partial overlap).",

        "b1aad2d4-6fc0-4999-86a2-c010450de218": "4.1.2. What assets and activities are not covered by these Criteria?\n\nEarly in the development of the Criteria, hydropower represented a distinct cluster of issues relating to both\nclimate mitigation and climate adaptation. For instance, while hydropower is a renewable source of energy,\nthe scientific and engineering literature illustrates a complex picture in terms of the greenhouse gas impacts\nassociated with water storage reservoirs associated with hydropower. As a result, the recognition of\nhydropower as a low-carbon energy source requires detailed examination.\n\nMoreover, the application of climate adaptation approaches to hydropower has been quite recent, with a\ngrowing but still small number of cases available and some controversy over the sensitivity, exposure, and\nneed to address climate impacts for existing and new assets. The path for future hydropower development\nis an important but sometimes divisive issue, and some projects have been associated with significant\nnegative environmental and social impacts. For the TWG, it was unclear if these complexities around\nhydropower represented a significantly distinct break from other types of water infrastructure assets since\nthe group did not contain a large proportion of hydropower specialists and experts.\n\nAs a result, hydropower related assets and activities are not covered by these Criteria. Readers are directed\nto the forthcoming Hydropower Criteria, open for public consultation in March 2018.\n\n4.1.3. How does this scope fit with other Sector Criteria under the Climate Bonds Standard?\n\nThe Water Infrastructure Criteria are intended to apply to a broad array of water investments and asset but\nthere are some cases where other criteria such as Forestry/Agriculture or Transport may be a more\neffective fit even when water resources are a fundamental aspect of the investment. Indeed, there may be\nsome cases when these lines are unclear.\n\nFor instance, for an asset involving the use of riparian forests and wetlands, these ecosystems may be\nmanaged for nutrient control for agricultural runoff (Forestry/Agriculture Criteria) as well as for flood\ndefence (Water Infrastructure Criteria). Forest management, energy, some types of water treatment, and\nother types of agricultural assets may all blur sector criteria.[22]\n\nWhere sector boundaries are not clear, the issuer should discuss with the Climate Bonds Initiative to\ndetermine the best sector Criteria fit. Generally, the primary purpose should be the basis for deciding on\nthe appropriate Sector Criteria to apply.",
        "87c25f45-5f98-4f65-8e54-cbeeb9a3a538": "### 4.2. What climate impacts are addressed in the Water Infrastructure Criteria? \n\nRelevant to all sectoral Criteria, the Climate Bond Standard aims to screen for assets and activities that:\n\n  - Align with a global economic transition that limits global warming to 2\u00b0C (ideally 1.5\u00b0C or less); and\n\n  - Are adaptable and resilient to unavoidable climate change.\n\nFor water infrastructure assets including nature-based solutions, climate resilience and the ecological\ninteractions of the investment are key concerns for long-term sustainability. If the design and operation of\nwater projects do not anticipate shifting climate conditions (including the relationship of the water project\nwith surrounding ecosystems), the reliability of water projects to function and be fit for purpose may be\ncompromised. Climate change is altering the risk profile for water projects across all geographies and asset\ntypes. In addition, the expectation for green and climate bonds among investors is that these assets have an\nenvironmental benefit and/or are designed to minimise negative impacts on ecosystems.\n\nPerhaps the best-known example of a major water project being compromised by changing climate\nconditions is the Hoover Dam in the USA's Colorado River Basin. The dam was planned, designed, and\nbuilt in the 1920s and 1930s using assumptions of much higher mean river flows, yet over the last several\ndecades, the timing and amount of precipitation in the upper basin have been deviating substantially from\nthese assumptions. Under these unanticipated conditions, the dam\u2019s ability to supply water to regional cities,\nto generate hydropower, and to meet downstream water demand is reaching operational limits,\nnecessitating considerable investment in auxiliary infrastructure (>1 billion USD) to maintain expected levels\nof service. Moreover, trade-offs between human needs and ecological requirements are becoming more\ndifficult and limited.\n\nAlthough the general practice of climate adaptation is still a comparatively young field in both theory and\napplication, the assessment of climate risk for water-intensive projects has become widespread and\nnormalised. Accordingly, the Technical and Industry Working Groups considered that climate resilience as\nwell as climate mitigation must be a fundamental component of the Water Infrastructure Criteria under the\nClimate Bond Standard.\n\nThis decision reflects an emergent body of practice among water managers and professionals that will only\nbecome more widely understood and accepted as the climate adaptation sphere becomes more accurately\ndefined and evaluated through new measuring and assessment frameworks.",

At the same time, although consumers would\nbenefit under these conditions, farmers themselves\nmay suffer if prices for their products fall.\n\nCountries with significant export markets that are\nproducers of GMOs and are able to distinguish and\nsegregate between GM and non-GM varieties will be\nin a better position for international trade than those\nthat have indiscriminately adopted the genetic engineering of crops as a core strategy in their agricultural production (Anderson et al., 2001). The separate\nproduction facilities and labeling that would be necessary for the effective segregation of GM and nonGM products, however, could have an impact on the\nprice consumers pay. In the US and Canada, one\nstudy estimates that commodity costs could increase\nby 15 to 50 percent due to the implementation of parallel handling systems for GM and non-GM farm\nproducts, and final retail food prices could increase\nby 9 to 10 percent (Paarlberg, 2002). A study in the\nPhilippines estimated the additional cost as 12 percent of current food prices (Leon et al., 2004).\nHowever, there is some skepticism about these figures, as it appears that a certain degree of segregation\nalready takes place within the US food supply; therefore, according to one author, the costs of separating\nGM from non-GM foods may not be as high as predicted (Stabinsky, 2002).\n\nIn order to make decisions that will allow their countries\u2019 farmers to profit through trade, governments\nneed comprehensive information on the major crops\nproduced in their countries for which GM varieties\nare (or could become) available, the destinations of\nthese crops on the global market, and the attitudes of\nconsumers in these markets. When necessary and\ncalled for by importing countries, exporters may\nchoose to segregate GM from non-GM crops, food,\nand other products.\n\nIllustrating the challenges that GMOs could present\nfor some countries\u2019 agricultural export industries is\nthe reaction of several European companies when\nillegally grown GM papayas were discovered in\nThailand in late 2004.

INTEGRATING SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONCERNS INTO BIOSAFETY DECISION- MAKING\n\n\nThe above discussion has introduced many of the\npotential social and economic impacts \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 of agricultural biotechnology,\npointing to the importance of considering these\nimpacts when making decisions about its application.\nIn this section, we outline what is needed to effectively take these issues into consideration when making\ndecisions about biosafety.\n\nThe steps toward integrating socio-economic considerations into biosafety decision-making can be divided into two distinct tasks: first, social science research\nis necessary to clarify the socio-economic issues relevant to biotechnology and biosafety in different\nnational and local contexts, as well as to generate\ninformation about the actual social and economic\neffects of the adoption of GMOs; second, the appropriate regulatory processes must be implemented and\nsupported so that socio-economic issues are in fact\nadequately considered and addressed. In the latter\ntask, effective mechanisms for public participation\nare critical.\n\n**CLARIFYING THE ISSUES: TOWARDS A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**\nA research methodology is necessary in order to gain\na better understanding of the social and economic\nimpacts of modern agricultural biotechnology.\nWithout such a methodology, the integration of socioeconomic considerations into biosafety decisions can\nbe problematic, as the appreciation of social and economic impacts could be left to the arbitrary discretion\nand judgment of political authorities. Without solid\nanalysis and a regulatory framework in place, decisions-makers could justify the adoption of GMOs on\nsocio-economic grounds, even in the absence of\nproven benefits. Conversely, even without proof of\nserious negative social or economic implications of a\nGM crop, regulatory authorities could deny approval\nbecause of purely political pressure from powerful\nconstituencies. Good decision-making requires regulatory assessments using a credible research methodology that is based on the best available social sciences,",

Water scarcity is projected to worsen considerably due to a\ncombination of factors such as population increase, higher incomes and changing\nlifestyles, pollution, and climate change.\n\nAgriculture is by far the biggest water user, accounting for more than 70% of global\nwithdrawals. With booming industrial and domestic demands for water, especially\nin fast-growing emerging economies, the competition for finite water resources is\nintensifying.\n\nWater scarcity and increasing competition present the agricultural sector with a\nhuge challenge. Farmers are expected to meet the rapidly increasing demand for\nfood, feed, fuel and fibre crops even though most land and water resources have\nalready been committed.\n\nConsequently, crop water productivity must increase (\u2018more crop per drop\u2019), partly\nthrough raising irrigation water-use efficiencies, either at the system or at the farm\nlevel. This is also an investment opportunity which, we believe, will attract the\nnecessary private capital for at least three reasons.\n\n1. Technologies to improve water use efficiencies are mature1 and are ready for\nlarge-scale adoption. These technologies include automated \u2018on-demand\u2019\nirrigation, remote-sensing technology to manage soil moisture, low-pressure drip\nirrigation, as well as drought-resistant crop varieties.\n\n2. Policies are starting to provide farmers and investors with the right incentives to\ninvest in water-use efficiency. Water prices are rising to better reflect the value\nand delivery cost of irrigation water. Rights to water are formalised and can in\nsome countries be traded from low to high-value uses. The private sector is\nengaging in providing expertise and capital as investment risks are shared.\nFarmers\u2019 access to product markets and financial services is expanding.\nConsequently, water-use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is emerging as an\nopportunity for private investments.\n\n\n**4** **|** **Rabobank Watering Scarcity**",

They are a\n\n primary source of livelihood, nutrition, income, and employment\n\n for Indigenous Peoples and other communities in Africa, Asia, Latin\n\n America, and elsewhere. Community forestlands provide a suite\n\n of ecosystem-service benefits, including carbon sequestration,\n\n pollination, and nutrient retention.\n\n\n-----\n\nA large body of literature shows that community\nforestlands with secure tenure are often linked to\nlow deforestation rates, significant forest cover,\nand the sustainable production of timber and other\nforest products. Titling or other measures to secure\nland rights do not alone guarantee low deforestation rates, but tenure security is recognized as an\nimportant precursor to other factors that promote\nsustainable management of community forestlands.\n\nMuch is known about the local and societal benefits of many community forestlands; questions\nremain, however, about the economics of securing community forestland tenure. This research\nreport seeks to address this issue by asking: What\nare the costs compared to the benefits of securing\nand maintaining tenure for indigenous forestlands\nin the Amazon basin? Building on WRI\u2019s recently\npublished working paper, The Economic Costs and\n_Benefits of Securing Community Forest Tenure:_\n_Evidence from Brazil and Guatemala, this report_\nfocuses on indigenous forestlands in the Amazon\nbasin of Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia; provides\noriginal matching analysis on deforestation rates;\nincorporates an array of ecosystem services into the\nbenefit-cost analysis; and provides a set of policy\nand program recommendations.\n\nThis report aims to inform technical leads in the\nland, forest, and financial sectors of governments,\nas well as funding agencies, on the economic gains\nachievable from securing community forestlands.\nSuch information can encourage new investments\nin recognizing and protecting community land\nrights. It may also help Indigenous Peoples, communities, and their partners to make economic\narguments for securing their land rights.\n\nThe matching analysis shows:\n\n**Tenure-secure indigenous forestlands**\n**exhibit low deforestation rates. The annual**\ndeforestation rates in the tenure-secure indigenous\nforestlands are significantly lower than on other\nlands in the three research countries of Bolivia,\nBrazil, and Colombia, suggesting that securing\nindigenous forestland tenure contributed to\nreducing deforestation in these areas between\n2000 and 2012.\n\n\nIn Bolivia, the 12-year average observed",

This is\nespecially so in Africa and Asia. Moreover, there are many commonalities in land tenure and governance between Indigenous\nPeoples and other communities.

In\nthis report, benefit-cost analysis (Figure 5) is used\nto assess whether the continuous effort of securing\nindigenous forestland tenure in the Amazon basin\nis worth pursuing from an economic perspective.\nIt involves comparing the total expected costs of\nestablishing and maintaining indigenous-forestland\nsecurity (Section 5) against the total expected\nbenefits (Section 4), to see whether the benefits\noutweigh the costs. Both benefits and costs are\nexpressed in monetary terms, and are adjusted\nfor the time value of money (2015 US$) so that all\nflows of benefits and costs over time (which tend to\noccur at different points in time) are expressed on a\ncommon basis in terms of their \u201cpresent value\u201d (see\nAppendix 4 for technical discussions of benefit-cost\nanalysis).\n\n\nIn this study, annual benefits and costs are calculated over a 20-year period and discounted to\ntheir present value in 2015 using a 6 percent real\ndiscount rate, which is the average discount rate\nbetween 2 percent and 10 percent\u2014the rates that\nare most commonly used in forestry studies (Cubbage et al. 2013). Box 7 provides the detailed justifications for these choices. The discounted benefits\nand costs are then compared to calculate the net\npresent value (NPV). NPV is a common metric for\ncomparing benefits and costs because it converts\nbenefits and costs into a single value by discounting so that they can be compared in present value\nterms. The results of the NPV can be used to assist\npolicy decision-making (Cubbage et al. 2013); a\npositive NPV indicates a gain from investing in\nindigenous-forestland tenure security in the Amazon basin whereas a negative NPV indicates a loss.\nIn our analysis, NPV results are presented at both\nper-hectare and aggregated-indigenous-forestland\nscales. Finally, results for 2 and 10 percent discount\nrates are also presented, as part of a sensitivity\nanalysis to understand the robustness of the results.",

The Amazon**\nbasin has vast reserves of hard minerals, oil, and\nnatural gas, many yet untapped, which governments are increasingly interested in exploiting\nto generate much-needed public revenues. The\nimplications for Indigenous Peoples are significant.\nMany governments are overhauling their laws to\nenable extractive resources extraction. For example,\nin Bolivia in May 2015, Supreme Decree 2366\nopened up several protected areas and national\nparks for oil and gas extraction, many of which\ncoincide with indigenous lands (Hill D. 2015;\nHill T.S. 2015).[27] The recent decline in oil prices\nhas encouraged governments to expand their oil\nfrontiers, especially in the western Amazon basin\nthat includes parts of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,\nPeru, and western Brazil.

Many blocks overlap indigenous\nlands. Unlike the eastern Brazilian Amazon basin,\nthe western Amazon forest is still a largely intact\narea where Indigenous Peoples have effectively\nprotected and sustainably managed their lands (and\nwhere many still reside in voluntary isolation).\n\n**AGRICULTURE. Agricultural practices (farming**\nand ranching) undertaken by settler families and\nagribusiness also threaten indigenous lands in the\nAmazon basin. Cattle ranching has been the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon\nbasin since the mid-1960s, and has resulted in\nIndigenous Peoples losing their lands.

In our\nother study countries, we eliminate from our sample all points\ninside protected areas. The purpose is to avoid conflating the effects\nof indigenous lands and protected areas. We compare average outcomes on (i) points inside indigenous lands, which are also outside\nprotected areas, and (ii) points outside both indigenous lands and\nprotected areas.\n\nHowever, in Brazil, that strategy is not feasible. The reason is that\ntoday, 99 percent of indigenous lands have been legally designated\nas protected areas subject to the same land-use and land-cover\nchange restrictions that apply to nonindigenous protected areas.\nMoreover, in some cases, protected area status was conferred\nupon indigenous lands after the start of the 2001\u20132012 period over\nwhich we measure deforestation.

By providing a sustained policy\nsignal on the price of carbon emissions, carbon pricing can\nencourage structural shifts in the ways of doing business\nby making low carbon investments more cost competitive,\nleading to investments in new technologies and products.\nCarbon pricing is recognized as a key tool to achieve net\nzero commitments, and as of May 2021, 21.5 percent of\nGHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing instruments (World Bank 2021).\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two primary types of carbon pricing, encompassing a variety of carbon pricing instruments. Explicit\n**carbon pricing directly imposes a price on each unit of**\nGHG emissions, including, for instance, carbon tax, carbon\nmarket, results-based climate finance (RBCF), and projectbased offsets. Implicit carbon pricing emerges because\nof other regulations without direct imposition, such as\nrenewable and energy efficiency support, removal of fossil\nfuel subsidies, and fossil fuel taxes.\n\nWithin explicit carbon pricing instruments, RBCF frameworks involve the crediting of climate finance to regulated\nentities, contingent upon their driving verified emissions\nreductions. Project-based offsets allow the sale of emissions\nreductions from specific projects by unregulated entities\nto external regulated entities. However, the two most\nimportant instruments to price carbon are carbon taxes\nand carbon markets. Table 1, below, provides a comparative\nassessment of the two.",

This revision of the\nNDC followed the country\u2019s November 2021 announcement of a long-term target to reach net-zero emissions by\n2070 (GoI 2021).\n\nIndia has undertaken several policies and targets in relation\nto energy supply, energy efficiency, and fuel switching\nin the power, transport, industry, and building sectors\n\n\nthat have contributed to reducing its GHG emissions\nand meeting its NDC targets. In the power sector, the\nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) set a\ntarget of 175 gigawatts (GW) of cumulative renewable\nenergy capacity by 2022, comprised of 100 GW solar, 60\nGW wind, 10 GW biomass, and 5 GW small-scale hydro\n(NITI Aayog 2015). Achieved installed capacity from\nthese sources stood at 117 GW as of August 2022 (CEA\n2022). Policies include a cess on coal production of INR\n400 per tonne (IISD n.d.), various capital and generationbased incentives, and various state-level feed-in tariffs\n(as determined by the different states) to make adoption\nof renewable energy financially viable. MNRE has also\ninstituted a renewable purchase obligation (RPO) policy\nfor power distribution companies to source a specified\nminimum percentage of electricity from renewable sources,\nwhich stands at 21 percent by fiscal year 2022 (FY22)\n(MNRE n.d.), and can be met through the purchase\nof tradable RECs.",

A carbon currency would also provide greater\n\n\nflexibility to regulated entities in terms of their emissions\nreduction choices, rather than targeting specific interventions such as energy efficiency or renewable energy, making\nemissions reductions more cost effective. However, this\nwould require a redefinition of sector-specific goals in\nterms of emissions, as opposed to energy efficiency or\nrenewable energy.

For example, between 2019 and\n2030, taking into account policies that were announced up\nuntil 2019, India\u2019s industrial sector emissions are projected\nto increase by 73 percent, representing the largest increase\nin emissions among all sectors in this period (Swamy et\nal. 2021). Moreover, the distribution of emissions in the\nindustrial sector across a relatively few point sources makes\nit possible to regulate emissions downstream (industrial\nunits combusting fossil fuels for their processes), providing more liquidity than upstream regulation (producers,\nimporters, and distributors of fossil fuels) in a market (see\nSection 3.2.1).\n\nOn the other hand, the building and transport sectors\u2014\nwhere emissions are distributed across millions of point\nsources\u2014require upstream regulation, in which case a\nmarket functions essentially as a tax that can typically be\nadministered directly at a lower cost (Coria and Jarait\u0117\n2019). Similarly, inclusion of highly informal sectors such\nas such as agriculture (comprising 14.4 percent of national\nemissions) and waste (comprising 2.6 percent of national\n\n\nemissions) in a potential carbon market would involve\nsignificant administrative and technical barriers without\nsignificantly increasing emissions coverage.\n\nWithin the industrial sector, market coverage can either\nremain limited to emissions-intensive industrial sectors,\nas in the PAT scheme, or be extended to include sectors\nthat are less emissions-intensive. Industry participants in\nthe study were overwhelmingly in favor of a market design\nthat is open to participation from all industrial sectors,\nwhich they felt would reduce compliance costs for the\nhard-to-abate sectors and provide a financial incentive for\nemissions reduction in less emissions-intensive sectors that\nhave also demonstrated climate ambition by undertaking voluntary emissions reduction targets.",

In the 1996 Good Practice Guidance\nfor developing national inventories, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) did not\ninclude the carbon stored in wood products after\nharvesting. For GHG accounting, this means that all\ncarbon stored in the trees was considered emitted back\ninto the atmosphere during harvest and that any\ncarbon that may have remained in wood products was\nthus not accounted for. This methodology however is\nchanging.

The first step in identifying the GHG\nassessment boundary for a LULUCF project is ensuring that\nthe location and size of the project site are accurately and\ncompletely defined. The location of the project site is important because it is the basis for a project activity\u2019s carbon\nstocks and carbon stock changes. Unlike other project types,\nthe carbon stocks for the same type of project activity are\ndifferent at different locations because of variations in a\nlocation\u2019s characteristics. The potential storage of carbon\nalso differs depending on the size of the project site.\n\nThe Project Activity\nOnce the location and size of the project site have been\nclearly described, the second step is identifying the project\nactivity or activities associated with the GHG project. The\nproject activity is the specific action or intervention targeted\nat changing GHG emissions or removals.\n\nWhen defining the project activity(ies), the project developer\nshould consider how the GHG project will differ from current\nland-use trends for similar types of land. For example, a\nproject developer may be trying to increase the carbon\nstorage on a forested site through better forest management\npractices. But if the current land-use trend in the area is\nselling forested lands for development or agricultural use, the\nproject activity may instead be forest conservation (i.e., to\navoid deforestation) rather than forest management.\n\nReforestation Project Activities\nThe project activity for reforestation projects is changing\nthe land use and land cover from a nonforest use to a forest\nuse in order to enhance carbon storage. Reforestation\nproject activities involve planting or restoring trees on\nlands that are not considered forest,[1] such as agricultural\nor abandoned land.\n\nForest Management Project Activities\nForest management project activities may increase overall\nGHG removals and reduce GHG emissions by means of\nvarious management activities that depend on the characteristics of the project site and management goals. For\nexample, the project developer may implement practices that\nreduce GHG emissions from disturbances through insect and\nfire prevention or control, or enhance carbon storage by\nplanting improved or different species of planting stock.",

These residual risks should be\ndocumented, as well as any mechanisms put in place to\ncompensate for this reversal of carbon storage. These\nmechanisms typically address any liabilities associated with\nthe reversal of the project\u2019s GHG reduction. Of course, both\nGHG programs and any private contracts associated with\nthe project must determine the exact nature of the liabilities. Risk management mechanisms generally include\nmeasures to obtain additional GHG reductions elsewhere.\n\nSome mechanisms for compensating for any future loss of\ncarbon storage benefits are:\n\n- Financial instruments, such as insurance, forward\ncontracts for carbon delivery at a future date, and options\nfor the delivery of stored carbon tonnes. Traditional forest\nor crop insurance may be adapted to include GHG reductions. The instrument should explain how it works and\nstate the time period over which it would operate.\n\n- Legal contracts, such as purchase and sale contracts for\nforestry and agricultural GHG projects that contain\nclauses/processes for restitution when carbon stocks are\nreleased. Restitution may mean going to the market to\nbuy compensatory (temporary or permanent) equivalents to replace the GHG reductions. The legal contract\nshould describe how liability is apportioned among the\ndifferent parties.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Portfolios or buffers are a form of self-insurance by a\nsingle GHG project or coinsurance by a set of GHG\nprojects. GHG projects can hold a proportion of the GHG\nreductions in reserve against the risk of reversal. A\nslightly modified approach bundles GHG projects, and\nonly a portion of the GHG reductions are sold or reported,\nthereby hedging against the risk of natural events affecting one project but not the others. Portfolios or buffers\nshould document the terms of the agreement, the GHG\nprojects they contain, and the time period that the agreement covers.

As\ngoals vary, so will the form of measurement. Metrics can\nbe structured around both processes and outcomes\u2014\nfor example, ensuring they are meeting regularly and\nachieving metrics, such as the number of audits deployed\nor energy efficiency program participation. Balancing\nprocess and outcome metrics can be challenging, and\npreferences will differ. Some may prefer process metrics\nif, for example, it is important to show that decisions\nare being made jointly. Others may prioritize outcomeoriented metrics if, for example, they believe that time\nspent on process reduces time spent deploying projects\nor programs. Metrics, both quantitative and qualitative\nsuccess stories, can help city and utility leadership and\nmembers of the community ensure successful delivery of\na partnership agreement.\n\nCities may want to evaluate whether it is possible to\ninclude big-picture indicators, such as community energy\nsavings or renewable energy consumption, with five-year\ntargets to a 2030 or 2050 goal. These can be challenging\nto measure and may require working with the utility to\ncreate community-specific analyses.[9] For instance, the City\nof Minneapolis is moving toward broad metrics directly\ntied to its energy and climate goals, such as percent of\nrenewable energy consumed by the city.

It is therefore\nrefocusing on broader outcome-oriented metrics.\n\nMetrics may be determined during the creation of the\nagreement or afterward as a result of advisory board or\nworking group meetings. Outcome-oriented agreements,\nlike Sarasota\u2019s, may lend themselves to predetermined\nmetrics according to the agreed-upon projects, whereas\nprocess-oriented agreements could benefit from\ndetermining metrics after the agreement. However,\nmetrics created later in the process may not have the\nproper data collection mechanisms in place and may face\ntracking challenges. Metrics may need to be reevaluated as\nthe partnership progresses.",

During the first phase of the\ninitiative, the partners tracked international flows\nand mapped the national finance landscape. Tracking and monitoring adaptation finance flows at\nthe national level formed an important part of this\ninitiative. In the second phase, the partners tracked\nspecific national flows and looked at accountability\narrangements at the national and local levels. In all\nfour countries, the AFAI partners developed and\ntested methods to track adaptation finance and\nlobbied for greater transparency and accountability\nof adaptation finance flows.\n\nThis report looks at emerging evidence of civil\nsociety engagement and identifies steps that providers of finance, governments, and CSOs themselves\ncan undertake to close the adaptation accountability\ngap. The question is: What does \u201cgood\u201d or \u201ceffective\u201d\ncivil-society engagement on accountability look like?\nEvidence suggests that, if CSOs engage in multipronged strategies, addressing accountability issues\nat different levels and through different means, they\ncan contribute to building an enabling environment\nfor collective action that can lead to more social\naccountability (Fox 2014).\n\nThere are several other organizations that have\nworked on tracking adaptation finance and promoting accountability. Not all organizations will face the\nsame challenges as the AFAI partners. Therefore,\nsome recommendations might not be applicable\nin certain countries or situations. Nevertheless, to\nclose the accountability gap, organizations that work\non climate, climate finance, budget monitoring, or\ntransparency and accountability can learn from the\nexperiences outlined in this report, analyze their own\npossibilities, and advocate or implement changes in\ntheir own national context.\n\nFor CSOs to engage in enhancing the accountability\nof funding, a number of conditions must be in place.\nPublic information, spaces for participation, skills,\ncitizen action, relationships between governments\nand nongovernment actors, and an effective official\nresponse to concerns are important elements of a\nfunctional accountability process.

In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, the\nBRT system created 1,900\u20132,900 net permanent jobs in\noperations, in addition to 1,400\u20131,800 temporary jobs\nin construction (Hidalgo and Guti\u00e9rrez 2013). In South\nAfrica, the BRT system created 15,000 construction jobs\nand helped informal minibus drivers transition to formal\nemployment (McCaul 2012).\n\nWell-developed public transit systems and infrastructure\nfor cycling and walking boost GDP and generate\nconsiderable savings that can be reinvested in public\npriorities (Mountford et al. 2018; Litman 2019). They\ncould unlock an economic opportunity worth close to\nUS$11 trillion by 2050, based on energy savings alone\n(Zhao et al. 2016). They can also avoid massive costs\nassociated with congestion\u2014with $100 billion projected\nfor 2022 in the United States (Partnership for New York\nCity 2018).\n\nThe uptake of EVs is expected to free up significant\nrevenues for governments and consumers. They reduce\nreliance on foreign oil and cut the national energy bill,\nrevenues that can be invested in supporting the purchase\nof EVs by public entities or private consumers (Todd 2013;\nStenning 2018; ECF 2017). EVs can also reduce utilities\u2019\nelectricity prices through a system referred to as Vehicle\nto Grid (V2G). By charging at night when electricity is\ncheaper due to low demand, EVs can then feed the grid\nwith electricity that is cheaper (and often cleaner) during\nlate afternoon, when demand and electricity tariffs are\nhigh (MacDougall 2018; Nelder et al. 2016).",

Forestry Conservation and Agroforestry: Impacts on Rural and Indigenous Communities\n\nThe global deforestation rate increased by 43 percent\nbetween 2014 and 2018, with an area of tree cover the size\nof the United Kingdom lost every year (NYDF Assessment\nPartners 2019). The world has missed the 2020 SDG\nTarget 15.2, which aimed at halting deforestation and its\n\n\n-----\n\nprofound harms for poor populations around the world.\nThe fights against deforestation, climate change, and\npoverty are deeply intertwined. Forests are the largest\nterrestrial storers of carbon and provide livelihood and\nsafety nets for one in five people (1.6 billion), including\n70 million indigenous people (Newton et al. 2016). Of\nthe world\u2019s rural extreme poor, over 90 percent are\ndependent on forests for at least part of their livelihoods\n(FAO and UNEP 2020). Poverty has a heavy impact on\nforest area change. Poorly managed shifting agriculture\nwas responsible for 24 percent of the world\u2019s tree cover\nloss between 2001 and 2015, including 93 percent in\nAfrica (Curtis et al. 2018). Around one-third of the world\u2019s\npopulation (about 2.4 billion people) uses wood for basic\nenergy needs (FAO 2017). Indigenous and forest-dwelling\ncommunities are also deeply affected by deforestation\ncaused by expanding commodity production (rubber,\npalm oil, soybean, cattle, coffee, cocoa, mining, oil, and\ngas), especially in Latin America and Asia (Curtis et al.\n2018). These communities have legally recognized tenure\nrights to only about 15\u201316 percent of forest areas, while\nthey hold and manage a much larger portion (FAO 2018).\nThose seeking to protect their forests have come under\nincreasing attack (Global Witness 2017).\n\nForest-related climate actions range from forest\nconservation with land use zoning and protected areas,\nto sustainable management, restoration, afforestation,\nand agroforestry, which consists of planting trees in\ncroplands (IPCC 2019).",

To address this, the operational\npolicy that sets out the World Bank\u2019s mission on\npoverty reduction, OP 1.00, should include specific\nrequirements for poverty assessments to assess vulnerability. This would mean identifying groups in a\ncountry who are vulnerable so that task team leaders can track and target these project benefits.

Table 15 summarizes the area within the PAGE agricultural extent affected by soil constraints.\nAcidity, defined in the FCC as a soil pH between 5.0 and 6.0\n(Sanchez et al. 1982 quoted in FAO 1995), is the most common\n\n\nglobal soil constraint, affecting a quarter of the PAGE agricultural extent. A soil pH of around 6.0-7.0 increases the availability of nutrients and promotes beneficial microbial activity.\nAcid soils tend to be saturated with exchangeable aluminum.\nIn some 17 percent of the agricultural extent, aluminum saturation is so high as to be toxic to plants. These problems are particularly acute in the highly weathered soils of the humid tropics, but can also be induced by long-term use of ammonia-based\nfertilizers.",

The\nneed to use those finite resources more effectively in the face of\ngrowing demands and greater pollution threats has already\nmobilized several international initiatives, such as the Global\nWater Partnership and the World Water Council. The most recent manifestation of the international concern was the Second\nWorld Water Forum held in The Hague, the Netherlands, in\nMarch 2000 (World Water Forum 2000). One relevant outcome\nfrom that meeting was the commitment by the UN systems to\nproduce periodic reports on the state of the world\u2019s water resources, a so-called \u201cwater development report.\u201d\n\n\nAn important objective of all such initiatives is to overcome\nthe lack of reliable and internationally comparable water information, a constraint reflected in several parts of this chapter.\nThe proposed Millennium Ecosystem Assessment should link\nwith and add value to the networks and resources of ongoing\nprograms including: the Global Climate Observation System\n(GCOS 2000); the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System\n(WYCOS 2000); the Global Environment Monitoring System\nfor Water (GEMS/Water 2000); and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC 2000). Some of these resources are significant. For\nexample, the GEMS/Water archive contains over 1.5 million\ndata points for 710 monitoring sites globally collected since the\nlate 1970s. Although the sampling sites are more numerous in\ndeveloped countries, the standardized data sets do include several of the key nutrient, ion, solids, and organic contaminant\nindicators discussed above.\nWith specific reference to water and agriculture, the FAO/\nNetherlands Conference on the MultiFunctional Character of\nAgriculture and Land (MFCAL) held in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in September 1999 explicitly addressed the multiple\ngoods and services of water in similar ways to those explored in\nthis study (FAO 1999b). FAO is also responsible for the\nAQUASTAT initiative established specifically to compile and\ndisseminate water information, with a strong focus on improving irrigation and drainage data (FAO 2000a). The University\nof Kassel compiled the irrigation map used in this study (D\u00f6ll\nand Siebert 1999) and is continuing to refine that map (in collaboration with FAO\u2019s AQUASTAT program).",

Net area expansion, therefore, understates the true scale\nof agricultural conversion impacts on habitat and associated\nbiodiversity. For comparative purposes, tropical deforestation\nrates range from about 50,000 to 170,000 km[2] per year (Tucker\nand Townshed 2000:1461-1472). Given that land is also con\n\nverted into agriculture from other sources (see Box 1 for the case\n_of China), a significant proportion of forest and grassland con-_\nversion must also be attributable to nonagricultural pressures,\nsuch as logging and urban expansion.\nThe two indicators, described below, have been developed\nto assess the extent to which natural habitats have been converted to agriculture, and the extent to which agriculture may\nbe threatening habitat reserves.\n\n**CONVERSION OF NA TURAL HABITATS TO AGRICUL TURE**\nThe greatest habitat disturbance, within the PAGE defined extent of agriculture, is likely to be found in agriculture-dominant\nareas (>60 percent agriculture), although areas with moderate\ninfluence (30-60 percent agriculture) may also experience significant disturbance to wild species mix and numbers. The extent to which different habitat types have been converted to\nagriculture is quite variable. Table 23 summarizes the proportion of each major global habitat type that agriculture occupies,\nbased on the World Wildlife Fund \u2013 U.S. (WWF-US) Ecoregions\nDatabase (Olson et al. 1999). The habitats most radically affected are temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and tropical\n\n\n-----\n\nand subtropical dry and monsoon broadleaf forests, of which\nnearly half the global area has been converted to agricultural\nuse. Although the rates of tropical rain-forest clearing are high,\nonly a fifth of all tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests appear to have been converted to agricultural use.",

The primary cause for optimism is that the majority of ap\n\nproaches involved are also beneficial to agricultural productivity. However, evidence from low-income countries, in particular, is that farming communities face many obstacles in adopting improved practices, even when they know the potential benefits (Smith and Scherr forthcoming). There are also knowledge\nand data gaps associated with practically all the regional and\nglobal extrapolations underpinning the quantitative analysis,\nas well as problems in measuring and interpreting field data on\ncarbon fluxes (see, for example, Duiker and Lal 2000). Criticisms have also been leveled at soil carbon sequestration analyses that overstate potential benefits by not fully accounting for\nthe total flux of carbon associated with fertilizer production,\nirrigation, and the application of organic manure (Schlesinger\n1999). Terrestrial biotic carbon sinks, some argue, could soon\nbecome saturated and would thus be vulnerable to future carbon release through land use changes brought about by new\npolicies, land management practices, and climate change. This\nsuggests that increasing sequestration in soil and vegetation\nsinks is only a short- to medium-term solution and that the only\nlong-term solution is to reduce fossil fuel emissions (IPCC 1996b,\n_New Scientist 1999)._",
        "ba9966d4-fc66-425c-83b5-5da43828785c": "###### Summary of Indicators and Data\nSome practical indicators of agroecosystems\u2019 contribution to global carbon services are the extents of crop- and pasture-land\nand the quantities of organic carbon stored in their soils (kilograms per square meter or tons per hectare), preferably to a\ndepth of at least one meter. Not only is the soil carbon pool\n\n\n-----\n\nmuch greater than that of most agroecosystem vegetation, but it\nis also less vulnerable to loss, particularly from that proportion\nheld below the plow layer. The soil carbon content indicator,\nwhich is relevant at multiple scales, is also straightforward to\nmeasure, although harmonization of data for different laboratory extraction and analysis methods is required. Although the\nstrategic importance of routinely monitoring soil organic matter\nis being increasingly recognized as an indicator of soil productivity, soil degradation, and carbon services (ISRIC 1999; Smith\net al. 1999), current data sets stem from an extremely sparse\nnetwork of soil sampling points and, mostly, for a single point in\ntime.\nFrom a vegetation perspective, it is necessary to improve the\ndescription of land cover within the extent of agriculture and to\nimprove the generic estimates of above- and below-ground carbon densities of field, pasture, and tree crops in different\nagroclimatic zones. Improving agricultural land cover estimates\nshould be feasible through a judicious combination of remote\nsensing data and agricultural production statistics.\nGiven that agriculture-related burning contributes to both\nCO2 and CH4 emissions in some areas of the world, monitoring\nthe incidence and extent of fires in such areas is both desirable\nand now feasible using satellite technology. There are significant practical difficulties, however, in reliably distinguishing\nbetween fires in agricultural and nonagricultural areas and between fires of natural and human origin.[25]",

Support from a neutral party like USP that is not\naligned with any interest group in the community is often very\nhelpful to stakeholders in reaching consensus.\n\nOnce rules governing resource use are established, an iqoliqoli\ncommittee is formed to coordinate LMMA work as well as to\nrepresent the community before relevant institutions on issues\ninvolving the LMMA. The iqoliqoli committee has the responsibility, as designated by the vanua (traditional community\ncouncil), for making all management decisions concerning the\nLMMA, following consultation with residents through village\ncouncil meetings (van Beukering et al. 2007:11).\n\nIn the community of Navakavu, for example, the iqoliqoli\ncommittee consists of 21 members, including landowners and\nthe headman from each of the four main villages using the\niqloiqoli, as well as the individuals serving in key posts established by the LMMA process: biological monitors, fish wardens\n(one from each village), and the leader of the youth environmental drama group (van Beukering et al. 2007:11\u201312).\n\n\nPeople in the villages of Navakavu are confident about the\ncommittee\u2019s competence and its responsiveness to community\ndemands. As one villager noted, \u201cThe establishment of the\n\n[iqoliqoli] committee has helped each member recognize their\nassigned duties and has encouraged them to perform well in\ntheir area\u201d (Leisher et al. 2007a:8).\n\nThe relatively small size of LMMAs (compared with large MPAs\nadministered by central authorities) tends to foster a stronger\nsense of ownership and engagement by the locals. The limited\nscale of the resource ensures that the impact of conservation\nmeasures can be detected sooner. In the case of Navakavu, the\nLMMA is even within sight of the managing villages, adding to\ntheir sense of control (Leisher et al. 2007a:32).",

Community\npartners who have been trained in LMMA techniques are eager to\npass on what they have learned to others. In addition to hosting\nformal workshops, the LMMA Network also promotes opportunities for informal learning and village-to-village exchanges.\nCross-site visits between Network communities enable those\ninvolved to learn from each other\u2019s experiences, methods, and\npractices (LMMA Network 2006a:7).",

Indeed, Fiji\u2019s government\nhas formally adopted the LMMA approach and has devoted a\ndivision of the Fisheries Department to coordinate with FLMMA\nto promote inshore conservation. The FLMMA Secretariat is\nnow even housed in the Fisheries Department. And as a result\nof community pressures on the Fisheries Ministry, Fiji has\nrecently set a 12-nautical-mile limit to keep foreign fishing\nvessels from iqoliqolis (Tamake 2008:2, 8; Aalbersberg 2008).",

About\n20 LMMA Network sites in Fiji have collected detailed survey\ndata on household incomes. However, only 3 of these sites have\ntime-series data to correlate economic benefits from increased\nfish catch. In Ucunivanua, average household income rose from\njust over F$430 (US$258) per month in 2002 to about F$990\n(US$594) in 2006, an increase of 130 percent. The community of Daku in Kadavu province experienced a gain in average\nincome of just over 30 percent in one year, from about F$235\n(US$141) per month in 2005 to F$307 (US$184) in 2006\n(Aalbersberg 2007).\n\nThe most comprehensive examination of the economic impacts of\nLMMA work has been a recent study by an international team\nexamining the role of marine protected areas in poverty reduction.\nThe team did extensive interviews with households in the\nNavakavu community, an LMMA site since 2000. A survey of 300\nhouseholds found that monthly income in Navakavu averaged\nF$418 (US$251), while income in control sites with similar\ndemographic and geographic characteristics averaged only F$197\n(US$118) per month (van Beukering et al. 2007:20).",

Typically, local councils in LMMA communities\nare called on to make many more collective decisions about\nresource management than was the case before the LMMA\u2019s\ncreation. This has revitalized traditional systems of community\ncooperation and joint decision-making, thus contributing to\nincreased social cohesion (van Beukering et al. 2007:15, 17).\n\nFor instance, a survey of villagers in the Navakavu community\nfound that more than 80 percent agreed that since establishment of the LMMA there has been a higher level of participation\nin community meetings, women have had a stronger voice, and\nthe community has become more united. More than 50 percent\nagreed that youth have more opportunities to share their\nopinions and that resource conflicts within the community have\ndeclined (van Beukering et al. 2007:30).\n\nIn Votua, another LMMA community, social cohesiveness has\nimproved considerably after 3 years of LMMA work. \u201cThrough\nour engagement with LMMA work\u2026our three clan chiefs are\nnow talking to each other after decades of disputes,\u201d observed\none community member (LMMA Network 2006a:21).\n\n\n-----",

Households earning additional\nincome from selling surplus fish and shellfish are better able to\nmeet their traditional social obligation to contribute to village\nfundraising. For instance, in Waiqanake village in Navakavu,\nthe Community Fundraising Project recently amassed some\nF$20,000 (about US$12,000), three quarters of which came\nfrom the sale of fish and shellfish from the LMMA (van Beukering et al. 2007:9).",
        "b71124e8-8fb8-4ecd-9cca-681a1343bbe2": "###### Sustainability\n\nThe LMMA approach has several distinct characteristics that\ncontribute to its ability to create long-term change. First, it\nrelies on strong commitment and motivation from the communities themselves, which tends to promote enhanced resilience.\nExperience with the initial LMMAs indicates that communities\nremain engaged in the collective efforts needed for successful\nongoing resource management.\n\nAnother favorable aspect is the relatively low cost to establish\nan LMMA. For instance, the total cost to establish the LMMA\nin Navakavu is estimated at less than US$12,000 over 5\nyears\u2014a modest investment that has led to a doubling of\naverage household income for about 600 people (Leisher et al.",
        "2bd7050b-d36a-474f-be53-4efe57dda64d": "2007a:iv). A separate study in Navakavu showed that the\nincrease in fish caught over this period has provided about\nUS$37,800 in benefits to the community (O\u2019Garra 2007:2).\nThe province-wide approaches established in Kadavu and\nother provinces of Fiji hold considerable promise as a low-cost\nand highly effective method for extending LMMA work to\nremote sites and may provide a model for other LMMA Network\ncountries to emulate (LMMA Network 2006a:35).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that successful LMMA work\nrequires a commitment to provide ongoing training for community members who replace people who move away from the\nvillage. Likewise, continual training is needed in LMMA Network\npartner organizations, such as government ministries, since staff\nmove around over the course of their careers and often leave the\ndistricts in which they had begun promoting LMMAs.\n\nThe role of external funding has also been significant. The cost\nof the LMMA Network\u2019s core operations is about US$500,000\nper year, much of which has historically been supplied by U.S.based charitable organizations, including the MacArthur and\nPackard Foundations. It has been challenging for the network\nto secure additional sources of support, especially for core costs\n(USP 2007:23).\n\nA FLMMA Trust Fund has been established to provide ongoing\nvillage assistance costs once donor funding ends. It was originally established with prize money from international awards for\nFLMMA work. More recently, Conservation International has\ncommitted funds in return for FLMMA managing the organization\u2019s Fiji Marine Managed Area initiative. A marine\nbioprospecting venture has also contributed to the fund.\nIndividual communities are being encouraged to establish their\nown trust funds as well (Aalbersberg 2008).",

Uneven support from regional\nand national officials and inadequate resources both cause\nproblems. Fish wardens often experience difficulties carrying\nout their assigned jobs due to this lack of resources. Many\nLMMA villages consider the availability of a specially designated patrol boat (with an engine) to be a prerequisite for\nsuccessful enforcement, particularly in areas of conflict with\ncommercial fishers (LMMA Network 2006b:2). While some\ncommunities have been able to secure the use of such a boat,\nthey may lack the means to purchase fuel for it.\n\n\nWhen violations are detected, only sanctioned fish wardens have\nthe right to take violators to the police. Some transgressors may\nbe brought before community meetings for more traditional\nforms of enforcement, such as shaming (LMMA Network\n2006a:15). But a general lack of consistency and an occasional\nunwillingness of official law enforcement to get involved often\nundercut the effectiveness of any compliance program (Rarabici\n2007). For instance, in the community of Tavualevu, on the\nnorth shore of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, the iqoliqoli\ncommittee has taken on violators who engage in destructive,\nillegal fishing using dynamite smuggled out from a nearby gold\nmine. Despite the confiscation of dynamite and offenders\u2019\nfishing gear by community fish wardens, many violators have\nevaded significant penalties due to lack of will within the\njudicial system to convict them (LMMA Network 2007a:14-15).\n\nA related challenge for communities engaged in LMMA work is\naddressing the suspicion of favoritism in enforcement. There is\na perception that some people, such as extended family\nmembers of fish wardens, are more able to \u201cget away with\u201d\nillegal entry into tabu areas or the use of prohibited gear (van\nBeukering et al. 2007:12\u201313). Community support for the\nLMMA program will be eroded if the appearance of preferential\naccess to marine resources is not addressed.",

This is what occurs when people decide that it\nis in their best interest to co-manage a community forest or fishery\nor work together to insure that an irrigation system operates\nproperly. Most ecosystem-based enterprises depend for their\nsuccess on collective action because they make use of common\npool resources, where many users have access to the resource.\nCollective action is essential to keep the resource from overexploitation and to make sure benefits are fairly apportioned. This\nkind of collaboration is nothing new\u2014groups have been engaging\nin collective resource management for millennia. However, many\nyears of research have confirmed that some conditions are more\nfavorable for inspiring and maintaining collective action than\nothers (Ostrom 1990:88\u2013102; Meinzen-Dick and Di Gregorio\n2004:1; Ostrom 2004:1\u20132; Agrawal 2001:1659).\nDemand is the starting point for collective action. Another\nkey condition is that the community or group must have the\nauthority to manage the resource. They must have the autonomy\nto create and enforce rules\u2014whether formal or informal\u2014for\nresource use. Without this ability to apply their rules and make\nthem stick, the rationale for joint action quickly diminishes (Bruns\nand Bruns 2004:1). (See Figure 3.)\nThe will and ability to enforce rules is paramount. Groups\nneed the authority to set boundaries and control access to the\nresource and the means to monitor the resource for infractions.\nThe rules themselves must have some force behind them, whether\nit is the threat of punishment, rewards for cooperative behavior, or\nthe threat of alienation from the group. To a certain extent, the\ndetails of the rules the group adopts matter less to the success of\nthe collective action than how well these rules are monitored and\nenforced (Bruns and Bruns 2004:1; Gibson et al. 2005:279\u2013282;\nBarrett et al. 2005:195).\nNot surprisingly, social capital is a fundamental building block\nof effective collective action.

But for 24\ncountries, the agriculture sector is the top source of emissions (primarily CH4 and N2O) (Arcipowska et al. 2019).\nIn such countries, the inclusion of all sectors in a net-zero\ntarget would be important to ensure that all major emissions sources are covered by the target.

For example, according to the Energy & Climate Intelligence\nUnit, as of March 2020, at least 21 cities had adopted a net-zero target by\n2050 or earlier, and another 50 cities had committed to set a net-zero target\nby 2050 given their involvement in the Deadline 2020 initiative by C40 (ECIU\n2020). In early June 2020, C40 and others joined the Race to Zero campaign\nas well.\n\nMany of the choices related to designing and communicating a net-zero\ntarget in a subnational jurisdiction will be similar to those for national\njurisdictions. However, a subnational jurisdiction will face additional\nconsiderations regarding the choice of the target boundary. Whereas\nnational targets will typically cover emissions and removals within a national\nboundary defined by the national GHG inventory, setting a subnational level\ntarget boundary is somewhat more complex. More activities taking place\nwithin the jurisdiction\u2019s boundary may result in emissions from sources\noutside of the jurisdiction\u2019s boundary. For example, a city\u2019s electricity\nuse may rely upon purchased electricity generated outside of that city\u2019s\nboundaries. As a result, a city establishing its target boundary will need\nto consider whether to include out-of-jurisdiction emissions, covering all\nemissions resulting from their city\u2019s activities, even those from sources\noutside of the city\u2019s boundaries. Subnational jurisdictions should consider\ncovering all significant out-of-jurisdiction emissions for maximizing\ncomprehensiveness and minimizing leakage, especially if a large proportion\nof emissions occur outside the city\u2019s boundary. If they choose to do so,\nthey should transparently communicate the inclusion of out-of-jurisdiction\nemissions so that cities can identify goal overlap, as one city\u2019s out-ofjurisdiction emissions may be another city\u2019s in-jurisdiction emissions.\nIdeally, subnational target boundaries also align with inventory boundaries.\nAccounting and target design should be guided by globally recognized\nprotocols, such as the Global Protocol on Community\u2014Scale GHG Emissions\nInventories.",

Within the context of these overarching\nissues, Congress participants examined not only how external forces and global change affected PAs,\nbut also how protected areas are relevant to the expansive economic, environmental and social agenda\nin the world today. The Congress, which was preceded by a set of regional preparatory meetings (See\nBox A), drew over 2,700 participants from academic and research institutes, community and\n\n\n-----\n\nindigenous organizations, government, international and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the\nprivate sector, and public agencies over the course of its nine days to participate in plenary and\nworkshop sessions, as well as side events and field trips to South African national parks (IISD, 20\nSeptember 2003).\n\n**BOX A: Regional Meetings**\n\nIn addition to a 1997 meeting held five years after the Fourth World Parks Congress (WPC), the following regional\nmeetings were held in the year leading up to the Fifth WPC, to highlight issues of concern and prepare for effective\nparticipation:\n\n**Protected Areas in the 21[st] Century: From Islands to Networks (Albany, Australia, 24-29 November 1997 )**\nThe Symposium produced a set of outputs, including: a new set of directions for the IUCN World Commission on\nProtected Areas (WCPA); the Road to Durban 2003, recommendations for the next Parks Congress; and, Protected\nAreas and the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\n**West and Central Africa Workshop (Kribi, Cameroon, 27-31 January 2003)**\nParticipants examined the need for novel financing and poverty alleviation mechanisms, an effective\ncommunications strategy and the involvement of minority groups and women in decision making.",

These participants saw\nthe WPC as an opportunity to increase extractive industries\u2019 awareness of the negative impacts mining\nand exploration has on biodiversity and wildlife.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe industry, meanwhile, in their side event, multiple workshops, panel discussion, and plenary\nsession, attempted to convey two messages to the conservation community: the industry\u2019s need for a\ncleaner, more rigorous application of the IUCN PA Category System (Six Main Categories of\nProtected Areas, from Strict Nature Reserves to Natural Monuments to Managed Resource PAs); and,\nthe opportunities and constraints inherent in the industry.

They also pointed out that their\nindustry is much more open to working with conservation groups than even a few years ago, thanks to\ndialogues through collaborations such as EBI.

The industry\u2019s\nvulnerability was most evident in its inability to control its own growth\u2014tourist arrivals worldwide\nnow stand at 700 million (Xinhua News Agency, 12 September 2003). The balance between the\nbenefits and potential harm of the tourism industry is particularly acute in South Africa, the world\u2019s\nfastest-growing tourist destination where the industry is the fastest-growing economic sector (Lunsche,\n14 September 2003).",

(See Figure 4b.)\nThe materials outflow intensity (DPO/GDP)\nof all five countries has fallen impressively\nsince 1975, although the trend appears to have\nslowed in recent years. Decoupling is partly\nthe result of successful attempts to reduce\nwaste volumes, especially landfilled wastes,\nand to increase recycling. (See section 3.4.)\nDecoupling appears to owe more to efficiency\nimprovements and the ongoing shift away\nfrom traditional energy- and material-intensive\nindustries toward knowledge-intensive industries, and the financial and other service\nsectors.

The climate effects of\nsuch an approach would likely have large adverse\neffects on agricultural output due to higher average\ntemperatures, extended heat waves, flooding, shifting precipitation patterns, and saltwater inundation\nor intrusion of coastal fields (Figures 1-4 and 1-5).[24 ]\n\nReducing agriculture\u2019s impact on climate and the\nbroader environment in a manner that fails to meet\nfood needs or provide economic opportunities\nwould probably undermine the political support for\nthat environmental protection.

In general, crop and pasture yields\ngrow, farmers increase their efficiency in the use\nof many inputs, and these gains hold down the\ngrowth in agricultural land area and emissions.\nUsing different ways of estimating historical yield\ntrends, GlobAgri-WRR also projects an \u201calternative\u201d baseline, and the land or GHG mitigation gaps\nrepresent the difference between these baselines\nand the land-use and emissions targets that must\nbe achieved for a sustainable food future.\n\nOur definition of the baseline projection, and\ntherefore of the land and mitigation gaps, already\nassumes great progress and effort by farmers,\ngovernments, businesses, and individuals.

In the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to\nset a target of stabilizing the average global temperature at no more than 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, and to explore a goal of 1.5\u00b0C. Although setting\na 2050 target for all kinds of emissions to achieve\nthese goals is complicated (for reasons we describe\nbelow), we believe the most plausible target is\naround 21 Gt CO2e per year.[65 ]Based on this number, and using the annual production emissions and\nannualized emissions from land-use change in our\nbusiness-as-usual baseline projection, we estimate\n\n\nthat agriculture would generate about 70 percent of\nallowable emissions from all human sources, leaving little room for emissions from nonagricultural\nsectors (Figure 2-7). Under the alternative baseline,\nagriculture would generate more than 80 percent of\nallowable emissions.[66]\n\nAnother useful analysis is the contribution agriculture would make in our baseline toward allowable\ncumulative emissions of carbon dioxide alone.\nBecause carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere\nso long, some models now try to estimate the maximum cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide (from\nall sectors) that are consistent with a good chance\nof holding climate warming to the 2\u00b0C goal agreed\nin Paris. One of the first such studies estimated that\nmaximum cumulative emissions of 670 Gt between\n2010 and 2050 would give the world a 75 percent\nchance of meeting the target.[67] United Nations\nEnvironment uses average estimates of 1,000 Gt for\na two-thirds chance of meeting the target.

One study of\nthe Green Revolution found that without improved\ncrop yields, the proportion of malnourished children would have been 6 to 8 percent higher because\nof higher food prices, and overall calorie intake\nin the developing world have been roughly 14\npercent lower.[78 ]\n\nFrom 1962 through 2006, as poverty rates declined,\nfood prices declined on average by 4 percent per\nyear, which played a significant role in decreasing\nthe number of the world\u2019s hungry.[79 ]This relatively consistent decline in food prices fostered a\nglobal complacency, which three successive global\nfood crises interrupted in 2007\u20138, 2010\u201311, and\n2012\u2014especially in 2008, when global cereal prices\ndoubled in just a few months.[80 ]During these periods, hardship led to major food riots.[81 ]\n\nThe future of global food prices is uncertain.\nA detailed comparison of 10 major long-term\nglobal economic model groups that forecast out\nto 2050 showed six projecting sustained food\nprice increases of various magnitudes, one showing essentially no change in real terms, and three\nshowing sustained price declines.[82 ]Regardless,\nstudies typically find that productivity gains can\ngreatly reduce food prices and the number of malnourished children.[83 ]",

But FAO projects that\nyields of most other major crops will grow much faster than\ntheir historical rates, including pulses (dry beans and lentils)\n(397%), potatoes (200%), cassava (209%), and sugarcane\n(192%). Using the method described below, the higher and\nlower growth rates of different crops roughly balance out\nfuture projections from the past.\n\nThere is no perfect way to calculate an average growth rate\nof different crops. For example, calculating the total growth\nof all crops by weight would be misleading because it would\ngreatly overvalue growth rates for high-yielding crops and\nundervalue the importance of growth rates for lower-yielding\ncrops. \u201cEffective yields\u201d also depend not merely on how\nmuch yields grow but also on how much increase there is in\n\u201ccropping intensity,\u201d the ratio of crops harvested each year to\nthe quantity of cropland. To determine an overall growth rate\nrelative to the past, we instead do a calculation that compares\nfuture crop area using FAO projected yields and future crop\narea if yields of each crop grew at their prior (linear) rates. This\nmethod not only averages out the effects of different crops but\nweights each crop by both its yield and its level of demand in\n2050.\n\nWe do these calculations in two ways. If we use one global\ngrowth rate for each crop from 1961 to 2010 to project the trend\nline, 20% less cropland would be required in 2050 according to\nFAO, which means by this method that FAO is projecting 20%\nlower growth in yields than historical trends. But if we use\nhistorical, regional growth rates for each crop to project trend\nlines, roughly 20% more cropland would be required, which\nmeans that FAO projected yields in 2050 are 20% greater\nthan historical trends would suggest.",

        "e902dee0-85ac-47f6-a19a-514bcaa06bb7": "###### The Challenge\n\nTwo factors influence global cropping intensity in\ndifferent directions. The first is the amount of fallow land\u2014cropland that is not harvested in a given\nyear. The identification of land as fallow implies\nthat cropland is being rested, which results in a\ncropping intensity of less than one. The second factor is the number of crop harvests per year. In some\nwarm climates with irrigation or sufficient rainfall\nthroughout the year, farmers plant and harvest two\ncycles of crops\u2014and in a few locations three\u2014each\nyear on the same tract of land. Multicropping creates a cropping intensity greater than one. In Bangladesh, for example, farmers on average achieve\n1.56 crop harvests each year per hectare\nof cropland.[285]\n\nThe need to increase food production and avoid\nexpansion of agricultural land means that it is\ngenerally desirable to increase cropping intensity.\nIn principle, if land is cropped once per year or\nonce every several years, cropping it twice per year\nwill produce more food, save land, and reduce\nGHG emissions. There are, however, three significant challenges.\n\nOne challenge is economic. Using a simple global\ncrop model, IIASA has estimated that the potential\nfor increasing double-cropping\u2014even on rainfed\nlands\u2014is large and that half of all land suitable for\ngrowing cereals could technically support two crops\nper year.[286] \u201cSuitable land\u201d counts both existing\ncropland and potential cropland, including forests.\nHowever, this estimate includes any land capable of\nproducing any crop with up to 10 percent of global\naverage yields. According to FAO global estimates,\napproximately half of all double-cropped land is\nirrigated, and farmers probably plant two crops a\nyear on only 6 percent of rainfed area.[287] Unless\nfarmers are missing opportunities, the realistic\neconomic prospects for expanding double-cropping\non rainfed lands must therefore be far more limited\nthan those projected by IIASA.\n\nSecond, the prospect of increasing double-cropping\nthrough irrigation is limited at best, and even\npresent levels may not be sustainable. For example,\ncropping intensity across India is already at 140\npercent, with Punjab ranking highest among Indian\nstates at 190 percent.[288] However, because much",

Under shifting cultivation practices, land is allowed to regrow natural vegetation,\ntypically trees, to rebuild soil fertility. Both the root\ngrowth and eventual clearing and often burning of\nthe trees adds carbon and nutrients to the soil. In\nthe forest part of the cycle, the trees can provide\nsubstantial carbon storage and habitat value, creating a landscape with higher values for both\non average.\n\nAccording to a recent estimate, areas of shifting cultivation, both cultivated and fallow, currently cover\n280 Mha of land.[290] This same study found that\nalthough fallow periods during shifting cultivation\nare declining, which reduces the share of land that\nis forested on average in the shifting agricultural\nlandscape, shifting cultivation is persisting as a\nsystem. In these areas, a shift to permanent or more\nregular cultivation is not carbon-free or without\nloss of habitat.",

What is the combined\npotential of these menu items? And to what extent\nmight climate change hinder progress if the adaptation measures discussed in Chapter 15 are not pursued? Table 16-1 summarizes the effects of several\ncrop yield change scenarios, based on the GlobAgriWRR model. All scenarios but the final one in Table\n16-1 hold cropping intensity constant from the 2050\nbaseline level. The final scenario uses the yield growth\nin our baseline but increases cropping intensity.[355]\n\nOur analysis first shows that differing conceptions of\nan appropriate \u201c2050 baseline\u201d lead to vastly different amounts of future cropland expansion. A purely\ntheoretical scenario that holds crop yields constant\nfrom their 2010 levels, and assumes no change in\nprojected demand, would require cropland expansion\nof more than 950 Mha between 2010 and 2050 to\nmeet projected food demand and accompanying high\nland-use-change emissions (more than 12 Gt CO2e\nper year during that period). Using FAO\u2019s projected\ngrowth in yields and cropping intensity (which follows\nhistorical trends from 1962 to 2006), as we do in\nGlobAgri-WRR, expansion is limited to 171 Mha and\nland-use-change emissions to 6 Gt per year. Using\nmore recent and slower estimates of yield growth\nfrom 1989 to 2008 from Ray et al. (2013), cropland\narea would expand 301 Mha by 2050 relative to 2010,\nwith annual land-use-change emissions of 6.9 Gt.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 15, a changing climate has the\npotential to depress crop yields, especially in the tropics.

This\nlarge additional expansion would increase the land\ngap by 45 percent and the GHG mitigation gap by 23\npercent, relative to the 2050 baseline.\n\nOn a more positive note, we model scenarios of additional increases in crop yields between 2010 and 2050\n\n\nto simulate large-scale implementation of the crop\nbreeding and soil and water management menu items\ndiscussed in Chapters 12 and 13. We model additional\nincreases in crop yields that are 20 percent and 50\npercent larger than those in our baseline, which would\npush global yield increases between 2010 and 2050\nfrom 48 percent under our baseline projection to 56\npercent and 69 percent, respectively. Such scenarios\nwould represent enormous agricultural progress, as\nboth would require more substantial yield increases\nthan the historical period 1962 to 2006, which encompassed the Green Revolution, and would be achieved\nin a period of greater resource scarcity and under a\nchanging climate.\n\nThe scenario that increases yields by 56 percent\ncompared to 2010 would bring the amount of necessary cropland expansion between 2010 and 2050\ndown to 80 Mha.

In the case of our more ambitious\nscenarios, these two strategies could even lead to a\ndecline in agricultural land area. But our calculations are based on the net need for agricultural\nland. Our model assumes that every hectare of land\nthat is not converted because of reduced growth in\ndemand (or increased yields on existing hectares)\nsaves the carbon that would otherwise be released\nby converting that additional hectare. Unfortunately, the land-use challenge is more complicated\nthan that. Even if net expansion of agriculture is\neliminated, agricultural production will continue\nto shift from one place to another. These shifts\noften involve conversion of biologically diverse and\ncarbon-rich habitats, which immediately releases\nlong-stored carbon and harms biodiversity.\n\n\nAlthough necessary to hold down net expansion of\nagricultural land, yield growth for some crops in\ntropical countries could even accelerate these shifts,\nby making farming more profitable and giving\nfarmers an incentive to clear new land. Translating yield gains into full benefits in the real world\ntherefore requires land management efforts that are\ndesigned to minimize gross\u2014not just net\u2014agricultural expansion and reduce the environmental costs\nof any expansion that does occur.\n\nTo achieve climate and ecosystem goals, some\nactive restoration efforts are also required. Agricultural land that is abandoned\u2014whether as a\nresult of agriculture shifting to other locations or\nnet declines in agricultural land area\u2014tends to\nnaturally regenerate into forests and other native\nhabitats. However, active restoration could enhance\nbenefits for carbon storage and other ecosystem\nservices. Today, a limited amount of agricultural\nland is so marginal that it is incapable of generating\nhigher yields in practice and warrants restoration\nright away. Little-used drained peatlands release so\nmuch carbon dioxide that they also deserve priority\naction.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",

Although\nboth Africa and South America had net losses of\nforest, these were substantially smaller than gross\nlosses, which implies that agricultural land expansion in some places is outpacing reversion to forests\non abandoned agricultural land elsewhere.[6] Asia,\ntoo, had large gross losses, particularly of native wet\ntropical forests. The continent experienced a net\nforest gain overall (nearly 50 Mha between 1990\nand 2010), but this gain was largely due to establishment of tree plantations, particularly in China.[7]\n\n\nAlthough these shifts in the locations of agriculture\npermit some abandoned lands to regenerate, the\ntrade-off tends to be poor from the perspective\nof biodiversity and carbon storage. New cropland\nis being established primarily in the tropics and\nsubtropics, where biodiversity is much higher.[10]\nMany newly converted lands were formerly natural\nor relatively natural forests and grasslands,[11] whose\nbiodiversity is often irreplaceable.[12]\n\nBecause conversion in the tropics often occurs\non relatively intact native ecosystems, the carbon\nlosses are often higher per hectare than conversion\nof agriculture in other parts of the world. It is at\nleast as important to note that tropical yields also\ntend to be lower. As a result, the carbon storage lost\nper ton of crops produced is higher in the tropics\nthan in the temperate and boreal zones.[13] Time also\nmatters. The losses of carbon during land conversion mostly occur immediately, while restoring\ncarbon in vegetation and soils occurs gradually over\nlonger time periods.[14]\n\nIn addition, farmers tend to abandon land that is\ndry and at higher elevations, whereas they tend\nto clear wetter and more productive ecosystems,\nwhich tend to be richer in carbon and biodiversity.[15]\nOverall, gross land conversion caused by shifting\nlocations of agricultural land presents a major environmental challenge that has received insufficient\nglobal attention.",

We estimate that the production process\nfor fertilizer will emit 408 Mt CO2e in 2050, an\nincrease from 359 Mt CO2e in 2010. Nitrogen fertilizer production generates high emissions because\nthe Haber-Bosch process requires high tempera\n\ntures, high pressures, and therefore high energy\nlevels to break the double nitrogen atom bond of\nnitrogen gas into nitrogen atoms that can be bound\nin various fertilizer compounds.\n\nOne opportunity involves making this process more\nefficient. Modern production facilities use 36 gigajoules (GJ) of energy per ton of nitrogen fixed, but\nthis is already roughly three times more efficient\nthan the original Haber-Bosch method.[251] Most\nof the improvement has been in the \u201cupstream\u201d\nsupply of hydrogen and nitrogen to the synthesis\nprocess,[252]and further improvements seem plausible because different fertilizer manufacturing plants\nhave different efficiencies.

The theoretical limit to the efficiency in modern production\nsystems is 20 GJ per ton of nitrogen fertilizer, and\nwe hypothesize that it might be possible to reduce\nenergy use to 24 GJ in real conditions still using the\nHaber-Bosch method.\n\nIn addition to efficiency measures, a wide variety\nof technologies will need to be deployed.

It corresponds to aquatic plant, honey, game,\nand other such products but also to some livestock by-products,\nsuch as offal. These products play a small role, and when diets or\nlivestock production systems call for such products, the model\ngenerates them without emissions or land-use costs.\nThe report refers to \u201canimal-based foods\u201d (and subcategories of such\nfoods) extensively throughout Chapter 6\u2014which are a combination of\nthe second and third types of agricultural products noted above. See\nFigure A-1 for additional clarification about the different subcategories\nof animal-based foods modeled in this report.\n\nIn each case, the model also uses FAO data to relate calories available\nas food in each region and country to food quantities produced based\non commodity-balance food products information included in food balance sheets. These coefficients vary by country because FAO estimates\nof the calorie content of final food products differ from country to country (mostly modestly but sometimes to a large degree) and because\nfinal products differ in quality and type (for example, the type of beef\nconsumed). The calories-to-quantity coefficients must reflect these\ndifferent calorie contents. For products that are the result of processing\n(e.g., alcohol), the relationship of production to consumption must also\nreflect losses during processing. We describe in more detail how those\ncoefficients are calculated for processed products below.\n\nOverall, one feature of this model that differs from most or all previous\nglobal agricultural models is the higher degree of disaggregation into\nboth different food products and their transformed products. This\nmakes it possible to analyze changes in more detailed diets.",

To avoid this scenario, when a country runs\nout of agricultural land, the model is programmed to cap production\nand to meet rising demand by changes in net imports. This cap would\nonly become relevant for extremely high growth scenarios.\n\nWe also have special rules regarding dry grazing land. In general, the\nmodel assumes that the full range of global production systems meet\nmilk or meat demands in the base year. However, we believe that all or\nvirtually all dry grazing land available in a country is used today, so that\nincreases in grassland areas must come from wetter systems (humid\nor temperate). We also believe that because dry grazing lands have\nlittle alternative use, they would continue to be used even if demand\nfor milk or ruminant meat declined. We therefore program the model\nso that changes in supply of milk or ruminant meat do not come from\n\n\nincreases or decreases in arid grazing systems and instead result in\nchanges in humid and temperate production systems.",

FAO reports these data per country. These balance sheets\ncover a wide variety of products that are derived products, such as\nsugar and sweeteners, alcohol, vegetable oils and cakes, brans, milled\nrice, and milk and meats. In addition, some products may be joint products. For example, soybeans generate both soybean oil and cake, and\nproducing milk will result in both milk and some meat production.\nIt is possible to handle these transitions by translating all final products\ninto primary product equivalents. For example, a kilogram of soybean oil can be transformed into a fraction of a kilogram of soybean\ncrop that might correspond to its weight or calorie percentage. An\nadvantage of this approach is that it limits the number of products,\nand also implicitly accounts for changes in coproduct shares when\n\n\n-----\n\ndemand changes. But a limitation of this approach is that the quantities\nof processed products may not be physically possible. For example, the\npercentages of soybean cake and soybean oil consumed may be different from the physical quantities actually produced by a given quantity\nof soybeans. In part because of the growing dietary importance of\nvegetable oil, which may come from multiple sources, we wished to\nhave a model that was physically possible for those products. We also\nwanted to have primary equivalents for other products\u2014namely, sugar\nand sweeteners, alcohols, and brans. The model therefore establishes\nrules so that production of a primary product is driven by its largest\ncoproduct by energy value\u2014for example, soybean cake in the case of\nsoybean products. The quantity of soybean oil production is therefore\nestablished by the demand for soybean cake for animal feed.\n\nSimilarly, the FAO commodity balances show that many products (e.g.,\ncrops) are devoted to processing. The finished products that come out,\nsuch as alcohol, may derive from different combinations of primary\nproducts, such as different grains. During the processing, some product\nquantities are also lost or transformed into bran and some other\nproducts that are typically used for animal feed and that do not show\nup in food balance sheets. The commodity balances do not directly\npermit a mapping of processed products to primary products, and such\na mapping is not straightforward.",

In the case of oil crops except for oil palm fruit, the quantity\ndemanded is based on the quantity of oilseed cakes required. The oil is\ntreated as a by-product and is the first source of vegetable oil. If more\nvegetable oil is required, the model estimates that this supply will come\nfrom palm oil production because it is the cheapest source of global\nvegetable oil production. For this assumption to function, palm kernel\ncake and palm oil are considered to be produced independently so that\npalm oil demand can be met by increased oil palm production without\nincreasing production of palm kernel cake. Similarly, the quantity of\nmeat produced by the dairy sector depends entirely on the quantity\nof milk demand, with the meat treated as a coproduct. The remaining\nmeat demand is filled by production systems for beef or small ruminant\nmeat that produce only meat.",

Along with nitrogen inputs from other sources,\nfertilizer demand can be estimated over time as a function of NUE, crop\nproduction, and crop yields. By estimating changes in NUE, various\npotential mitigation options can be analyzed.\n\nFor nitrogen from manure, to ensure consistency with the livestock\nmodel and potential changes in livestock production, we replaced the\nmanure estimates in Zhang et al. (2015b) with manure estimates from\nthe livestock model adapted from Herrero et al. (2013). In addition,\nbecause nitrogen in crop residues is not explicitly accounted for, a coefficient is used that links nitrous oxide emissions from residues to other\nsources of nitrous oxide emissions based on FAOSTAT emissions data.\n\n\n-----",

All net increases in agricultural\nland can therefore only come from these land covers. The EPA model\nalso did not account for the high carbon losses associated with peatland conversion for palm oil production in Southeast Asia.\n\nOne challenge in calculating emissions from land-use change is that\nmethods such as those employed by our model typically ignore the\nforgone carbon sequestration that would occur in forests, and some\nsavannas and scrublands, if the land were not converted to agriculture.\nCarbon stock estimates are typically based on existing forests, not\nundisturbed forests. Many and probably most of the world\u2019s forests and\nwoodland/savannas have been subject to forest harvest, whether for\ncommercial production or firewood, and have depleted carbon levels.\nIn satellite mapping systems, many lands that appear as savannas\nand open forest are actually abandoned agricultural lands regenerating with wood, or mixed-use landscapes. If not converted to cropland,\nsome of these lands would increase their carbon stocks, and others\nmight continue to be used but would contribute wood or even agricultural products that help meet human needs. If carbon stocks are taken\nas fixed, the model neither picks up this forgone sequestration or the\nloss of biomass for human uses that might be replaced elsewhere. Put\nanother way, the full opportunity cost of converting this land is not captured. Data limitations frustrate attempts to estimate these costs more\nfully because regeneration and harvest rates are unknown.

The modeled diet provided a 38% reduction in GHG emissions and a 40% reduction in land use relative to the average Dutch diet.|\n|Westhoek et al. (2014, 2015)|Predicted that halving consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs in the European Union would reduce nitrogen emissions by 40% and GHG emissions by 25\u201340%. Also predicted a 23% reduction in domestic cropland needed to feed each EU citizen.|\n|Tom et al. (2015)|Found that shifting from the current U.S. diet to one that reduced overall caloric intake and also followed U.S. dietary guidelines actually increased energy use by 38%, blue water footprint by 10%, and GHG emissions by 6%. However, the scenario modeled included not only a 25% decrease in meat consumption but also a 78% increase in dairy consumption\u2014leading to an overall 13% increase in animal-based food consumption.|\n|Springmann, Godfray, et al. (2016a)|Found that transitioning to more plant-based diets in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce food- related GHG emissions by 29\u201370%, relative to a reference scenario in 2050, along with health and economic benefits.|\n|Erb et al. (2016)|Found that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without further deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels\u2014including all scenarios with a fully vegan world population, and 94% of scenarios with a fully vegetarian population.|\n|Springmann et al.

An estimated 12 percent of\nall animal species live in fresh water (Abramovitz 1996:7). Many\nothers, including humans, depend on fresh water for their survival. In Europe, for example, 25 percent of birds and 11 percent of mammals use freshwater wetlands as their main breeding and feeding areas (EEA 1995:90). Although freshwater ecosystems have fewer species than marine and terrestrial habitats, species richness is very high when habitat extent is taken\ninto account (see Table 6). There are 44,000 described aquatic\nspecies, which represent 2.4 percent of all known species, according to estimates from Reaka-Kudla (1997:90). Yet freshwater systems occupy only 0.8 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface\n(McAllister et al. 1997:5). In addition, scientists estimate that\nthe number of known freshwater species is only a portion of the\nactual number of freshwater species. In fact, in the last 18 years,\nabout 309 new freshwater species have been described each\nyear (Nelson 1976, 1984, 1994).\nHumans use these animals and plants for food, crops, skins,\nmedicinal products, ornamental products (such as aquarium\nfish), biological control of insects and weeds, and increasingly\nfor recreational purposes. In addition, freshwater biodiversity\nhelps maintain ecosystem functions and ecosystem services,\n\n\nsuch as primary productivity, water purification, nutrient recycling, and waste assimilation.\nPhysical alteration, habitat loss and degradation, water withdrawal, overexploitation, pollution, and the introduction of nonnative species all contribute directly or indirectly to declines in\nfreshwater species. These varied stresses affecting aquatic systems occur all over the world, although the particular effects of\nthese stresses vary from watershed to watershed. In a recent\nstudy of freshwater fish by Harrison and Stiassny (1999), habitat alteration and the introduction of nonnative species were\nfound to be the major causes driving the extinction of species.",

Although relevant due to its extensive use in\n\n\nthe past, eminent domain as a method of land acquisition is gradually becoming inactive, with fewer use cases\nin recent times.",
        "9636826e-c1db-46ab-81db-88d6df910f66": "###### Q6.1 Tax Increment Financing\n\nTIF is based on taxing future increases in property values.\nTIF works best in markets with defined frameworks for\nassessing and collecting property taxes and developed\nmunicipal capital markets, such as in the United States. It\nhas generally struggled in developing countries. TIF revenues can be used to back TIF bonds issued by the public\nauthority or can be used to reimburse a private developer\n\n\n-----\n\nas incremental taxes are generated (without bond issuance) (Chicago Department of Planning and Development\nn.d.). In the latter case, the developer can only get repaid\n(an amount that typically includes interest) after the\nproject delivers and begins to be integrated in the market.\nThis form of TIF requires a developer to absorb some of\nthe risk, in that the developer is required to invest its own\ncapital in infrastructure costs (Amirtahmasebi et al. 2016).\nTIF funds can be allocated for specific uses, such as the\nredevelopment of specific areas or to earmark funds for\nhigh-priority needs and areas. This tool is most effective\nwhen supportive legal and regulatory frameworks are in\nplace (such as designated intervention areas).\n\nAlthough it can be a valuable mechanism for reinvestment in public infrastructure or to compensate private\ndevelopers, TIF has been criticized for not always fulfilling\nthe goal of boosting economic development. Critics often\nclaim that TIF tends to use tax money for a special fund\nthat often works in an opaque way\u2014meaning that the\nmoney does not always go toward the types of projects that\ndeserve this type of incentive (Merriman 2018). Issues of\ntransparency arise since cities\u2019 financial decisions on TIF\nare separate from the traditional budgeting process.",
        "94c52b83-2ec9-4665-8c9e-fab1d1dd3a6d": "###### Q7.1 Planning Instruments\n\nZoning exemptions or requirements are some of the most\ncommon incentives provided in exchange for meeting\ncertain public objectives (Burnier 1992). Zoning incentives\ninclude greater height or floor-area allowances, such as\ndensity bonuses; and parking space reductions. Sometimes these incentives are packaged into overlay zones,\nwhere specific areas qualify in hopes of spurring development (Arrington 2005; Atkinson-Palombo 2010). These\nzones also give cities the opportunity to clearly outline\ntheir public benefit requirements.",
        "0937ac3e-8f26-4e30-94ff-6001a2323e86": "###### Density bonus\n\nDensity bonuses are ways for local governments to encourage developers to provide public amenities by adopting a\ndensity incentive zoning program in the TOD area. When\nWhite Flint, Maryland, upgraded its rail transit station in\n2010, the planning authority adopted a combination of\nvalue capture mechanisms, including upzoning[5] the TOD\narea with a density incentive program, where developers\ncould opt to either limit their projects to the standard\ndensity maximums\u20140.5 FAR or 10,000 square feet (sq.\nft) (whichever is greater) and 40 feet (ft) in height\u2014or be\nallowed to build at higher density (Cervero et al. 2004).\nDepending on the area and the level of benefits provided,\ndensity incentives could go up to 3.5 FAR and 300 ft in\nheight (Morris 2002). Projects can receive density incentives for providing public facilities like schools, libraries,\nrecreation centers, parks, public parking, or affordable\nhousing beyond the required minimum (Sloan 2010). In\na booming real estate market, where there is little room\nfor affordable developments, linking affordable housing\nproduction to market-rate development using density\nincentive zoning can be an effective tool if the profit from\nadditional density exceeds the extra cost of building the\naffordable housing.",

This is especially the case when expropriation laws explicitly grant broad discretion to interpret\nwhat constitutes a public purpose. In South Africa, for example, executive bodies must provide only a \u201csufficient reason\u201d why expropriations are\nneeded for public purposes.[53] Courts will often take this reason at face value and not investigate whether the proposed expropriation is actually likely\nto serve public interests.\n\nIn Kelo vs. City of New London, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the fact that expropriations for \u201ceconomic development\u201d benefit private\nparties and produce only incidental public benefits did not render the expropriation unconstitutional.[54] The Court refused to second-guess the\nlegislature\u2019s justification for the expropriation and refused to inquire whether there is \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that the proposed expropriation would\nactually serve a public benefit.[55]\n\nIn contrast, some courts have taken a more active approach to reviewing justification decisions. In Sri Lanka, for example, the Supreme Court\noverruled a decision to expropriate land for a private golf resort in the Water\u2019s Edge case (2008).[56] The Court made its decision despite the legislative\nprovision stating that the Minister\u2019s declaration that land is needed for a public purpose \u201cshall be conclusive evidence that such land . . . is needed\nfor a public purpose.\u201d[57]\n\n\n-----\n\nThis provision opens the door for the Zambian President\nto abuse his or her expropriation power by arbitrarily\njustifying an expropriation decision under the pretext of a\npublic purpose, when the actual purpose is not intended\nto serve public interests. Overall, as the FAO Handbook\npoints out, the public and affected populations in these\n16 countries may be less likely to consider arbitrary\njustification decisions as genuinely serving public\ninterests, and more likely to protest such decisions.[58]\n\n**_Key finding: Only four of the 30 countries assessed_**\nclearly define the concept of public purpose to allow for\njudicial review.",

In societies where women\nare considered dependents of their husbands, and have\nno direct right to land, compensation is usually paid to\nthe male head of the household. As the FAO Handbook\ndiscusses, if compensation is paid to the male head of\nhousehold, the \u201cneeds of women and children may be\nignored as the money vanishes, to the detriment of the\nfamily\u2019s health and welfare.\u201d[98] When laws are silent on\nwhether compensation must be sensitive to the differing\nways in which women and men hold and use their lands\nand resources,[99] compensation might be paid only to\nthe male head of household.

RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThis working paper aims to establish a benchmark for\nprogress to assist civil society organizations, NGOs,\npolicymakers, advocates, affected populations, investors,\nand other stakeholders in measuring government progress\ntoward adopting international standards on expropriation\nin domestic laws.\n\nIn the majority of the 30 countries assessed, significant\nsteps must be taken to ensure that expropriation laws adopt\ninternational standards established in Section 16 of the\nVGGTs. Progressive legislation on expropriation recently\npassed in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam\nshows that some governments are taking steps to adopt\ninternational standards and to ensure responsible land\ngovernance. But there remains ample room for progress.\n\nThe six recommendations below are based on the\nresearch findings outlined above. They are directed\ntoward governments, civil society organizations, and\nother stakeholders working on legal reforms relating to\nexpropriation, compensation, and resettlement.\n\n**1. Provide a clear conceptualization of public**\n**purpose to allow for judicial review. In**\naccordance with Section 16.1 of the VGGTs, laws\nshould provide a clearly defined list of public\npurposes to guide courts when determining whether\nproposed expropriation decisions serve genuine public\npurposes. Laws should subject government decisions\nto independent and impartial oversight by judiciaries\nto ensure proper checks and balances, and to prevent\nexecutive and legislative branches from abusing,\nmisusing, or over-using expropriation power.\n\n**2. Limit the amount and types of land that**\n**governments can expropriate. In accordance with**\nthe VGGTs, governments should limit the amount of\nland expropriated to the minimum amount necessary\nto achieve a public purpose. Governments should\nestablish special protections for areas of cultural,\nhistorical, and environmental significance, and\nareas held by poor and vulnerable groups, including\nIndigenous Peoples and local communities. Laws\nshould ensure that these areas are acquired only as\na last resort, and, if expropriation of these areas is\nunavoidable, that the risks to these impacted areas are",
        "1f873261-0b12-4e07-acec-9c0869c0ecdd": "adequately addressed. One option for ensuring that\nstates are sensitive to these areas is for laws to obligate\ngovernments to conduct and publish a cost-benefit\nanalysis, whereby the government weighs the costs\nborne by the affected populations and environments\nagainst potential public benefits. In addition to\nthoroughly examining project plans (e.g., financial\ncosts, schedules, and monitoring capacity) these\nassessments should incorporate public consultations.\nGovernment bodies should consider conducting a\n\u201cproportionality test,\u201d[157] which entails examining\na proposed expropriation project to determine (a)\nwhether the expropriation project is necessary to\nserve a public purpose (there are no less intrusive\nalternatives), (b) whether the project is suitable\n(reasonably likely to achieve the intended public\nbenefit), and (c) whether the benefits deriving from\nthe expropriation are proportionate to costs borne by\naffected populations and the environment.\n\n**3. Establish transparent and participatory**\n**processes for the expropriation of land. To**\nconform to Section 16.2 of the VGGTs, governments\nshould be legally obligated to survey, inform,\nand consult affected populations in an open and\nparticipatory manner prior to taking possession of\nexpropriated land. By surveying affected populations,\ngovernments can determine who is entitled to\ncompensation and understand the impact of the\nexpropriation on livelihoods. Providing information\non expropriation plans to affected populations can\nbe an effective first step toward ensuring that these\npopulations are able to participate meaningfully in\nexpropriation decision-making and other processes\n(e.g., compensation processes, resettlement processes).\n\n**4. Respect legitimate tenure rights by ensuring**\n**that customary tenure rights holders**\n**are compensated when their lands are**\n**expropriated. To ensure that tenure rights are**\nrespected, states should be required to compensate\nall affected populations, including unregistered\ncustomary tenure rights holders and users of pastures\nand other undeveloped areas.",
        "b5ba6554-e036-4f91-9050-346e23dad802": "-----\n\n**5. Ensure that governments follow a**\n**comprehensive and gender-sensitive approach**\n**to compensating affected populations.**\nConsistent with the VGGT gender provisions, states\nshould be required to follow a gender-sensitive\napproach to providing compensation, accounting\nfor the losses borne by women and men from\nexpropriation. For compensation to comprehensively\nreflect all of the losses borne by the tenure rights\nholders, compensation payments should reflect the\nland\u2019s historical and cultural value, in addition to\neconomic activities and improvements associated\nwith the land. Consultations with male and female\nlandholders about the ways in which they use their\nland, and their land\u2019s historical/cultural value, can\nbe an effective measure to ensure that compensation\nis sufficiently comprehensive. Additionally, states\nshould be legally obligated to pay compensation to\naffected populations prior to taking possession of the\nexpropriated land, and should ensure that affected\nlandholders can negotiate compensation amounts and\nappeal compensation decisions to courts or tribunals.\n\n\n**6. Minimize forced evictions and, if evictions are**\n**unavoidable, provide displaced persons with**\n**a relocation allowance, alternative housing,**\n**or access to productive alternative land. As**\nstated in Section 16.8 of the VGGTs, governments\nshould be legally required to avoid or minimize forced\nevictions. When forced evictions are unavoidable, the\ngovernment should be legally obligated to consult\nwith displaced persons, and to provide them with a\nrelocation allowance and alternative land to ensure\nthat they are not subject to impoverishment risks.\nLawmakers should look at India\u2019s Right to Fair\nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,\nRehabilitation, and Resettlement Act of 2013 as a\nmodel when drafting resettlement procedures that\nadopt the VGGT standards established in Sections\n16.8 and 16.9.\n\n\n-----",

Begun in 2004, the project aimed to address declining\nagricultural productivity in the \u201c3H\u201d Basin (comprising the Huang, Huai, and Hai River\nBasins). The project drew on time-proven techniques for increasing output: irrigation\nupgrades, improved water-use efficiency, and broader access to markets and information.\n\nOne year after the project\u2019s initiation, China solicited a second loan from the World\nBank, this time from the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Special Climate Change Fund.\nThis grant, titled \u201cMainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change into Water Resources\nManagement and Rural Development,\u201d was intended to address a missing element\nof the initial project. The grant proposal noted that \u201calthough key components of [the\nagricultural project] are climate sensitive, adaptation measures for climate change\nwere not included in [the] project design because the role of adaptation has been widely\nrecognized only recently.\u201d The realization of the relevance of climate change to this\nproject was spurred by predictions that higher temperatures could increase evaporation\nand that sea level rise could cause salinization of ground water, restricting any increase\nin agricultural productivity.\n\nThe new grant incorporates climate change concerns into the existing project by\nmodeling climate change impacts on hydrology and agriculture and by testing a wide\nrange of adaptation measures at demonstration sites. As the project\u2019s title attests,\na broader aim is the integration of adaptation to climate change into agricultural\ndevelopment planning throughout the country. Through workshops, training, and\ninstitution of a national climate change adaptation plan for the agricultural sector,\nChina hopes to reverse the inattention to climate change evidenced in the original\nproject, and install in its place a focused awareness of the relevance of climate change\nto development.\n\nSource: World Bank 2007.",

For highly impactsoriented adaptation efforts, information about climate\nchange predictions often serves as a starting point for\nplanning. For efforts that address the underlying drivers of\nvulnerability, climate predictions are less critical, and the\nmost important information may focus on indicators of\nsocioeconomic circumstances.\n\nHowever, irrespective of whether efforts are more\n\nvulnerability- or impacts-oriented, some common\ninformation needs can be identified. This points toward\nspecific capacity-building priorities with relevance across\nthe spectrum of approaches to adaptation. For example,\ngeographical information plays a central role in adaptation\nplanning, irrespective of vulnerability- or impactsorientation. Whether this means mapping of flood risk,\nsoil moisture, poverty indicators, watershed boundaries,\nor any number of other relevant parameters, the capacity\nto synthesize and convey information geographically\nis needed, given the location-specific nature of climate\nchange effects.\n\nLikewise, basic national statistical data play a\n\nfundamental role in most vulnerability assessment\nprocesses larger than the community scale. Investment in\nsystems for gathering and managing reliable census data\nis a precondition for identifying vulnerable populations,\nwith or without climate prediction information. Similarly,\ngiven the likelihood that most adaptation efforts\nwill continue to focus on capacity-building and riskmanagement approaches, historical and current weather\ndata play a more important role in adaptation than do\nclimate change predictions. Therefore, national weather\nservices are central adaptation players; effective adaptation\ndecision-making will ensure that they are well funded,\nwell managed, and able to reach both key decision-makers\nand the population at large. The SERVIR project (Box 11)\nprovides an example where governments are collaborating\nto produce, share, and use climate information for\ndecision-making.\n\nInformation dissemination and awareness-raising also\n\nplays a significant role in implementation, and provides\nthe foundation for fair and effective public participation\nin adaptation decisions. Information dissemination\nprocesses need to be tailored to their audiences, and will\nhave unique elements depending upon the nature of the\ninformation being conveyed.[4] However, the centrality\nof information dissemination argues for adaptation\ninvestments in communications infrastructure, such\n\n\n**Box 11. servir: Accessing Climate Information**\n**for Adaptation in Central America**\n\n\nUnlike their neighbors in North and South America, the countries of\nCentral America do not have their own satellites or space agencies.",

(For details on each case study, see Annex 4.)\n\nFollowing this summary of cases is a discussion of\nthe policy impacts of the GIS activities studied. We\nexplore both planned and unanticipated impacts, as\nwell as multiplier effects in agencies and policy arenas\nfar removed from those directly involved in the cases\nexamined.\n\nFinally, we consider the case study findings as they\nrelate to the conceptual framework that guided this\nstudy. This entails assessing the implications of the\nfindings for level of awareness of GIS in the region,\nexistence of a demand for GIS products and services,\nand existence of national geo-information policies.\n\n**Overview of Case Studies: Burkina Faso**\n\nFour case studies were performed in Burkina Faso and\nreviewed at a national workshop in September 1999.\nThese cases examined GIS activities within projects\naddressing diverse environmental and natural resources\nissues, including rural water supply, food security/\nfamine early-warning systems, control of desertification,\nand national land use planning. One project began in\nthe late 1980s, but for the most part, projects were\nundertaken from the mid- to late 1990s.\n\nDiverse entities financed and executed the GIS\nactivities studied. Funders included the Government of\nBurkina Faso as well as international organizations\n(UNDP, WHO, AFDB) and bilateral assistance agencies\n(USAID, EU, Italy, France (GTZ), the Netherlands).\nExecuting entities were national governmental bodies\nand international agencies.\n\n**Results and impacts:**\n\n- In the first case study, GIS experts created spatial\nanalyses of climate, agricultural, and population data\nto provide information required for a famine early_warning system. Spatial maps highlighted zones with_\ncrop production deficits. These analyses provided\ntimely warnings about projected crop production\nshortfalls for the 1997\u201398 growing season, which\nenabled government officials to take corrective\nactions. GIS studies also accurately predicted crop\nproduction deficits in the 2000-01 growing season.\n\n- A second project produced a spatial database for use\n\n\n-----\n\nGIS: SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IN WEST AFRICA 9",

None of\nthe three case studies presented at the workshop\nincluded scenario analysis based on simulations\nshowing the effects of changes in the value of key\nvariables. GIS analyses often are quite static, and the\nGIS analysts do not make projections which could\ngenerate proactive planning and management.\n\n- GIS applications suffer from a lack of research input.\nUniversities often are not involved in development\nprojects, and their scientists had no input in any of\nthe cases studied. Consequently, outdated datasets\nare frequently used, and little opportunity is afforded\nfor the latest scientific knowledge to be applied in the\nimplementation of development projects.\n\n- Although the PNGIM has promoted communication\nbetween data producers and users, there is no\nsustained dialogue between policymakers and GIS\nanalysts. Workshop participants attributed this\nphenomenon to several factors. One of which is a\nperception that GIS analysts are not open-minded,\noften working in isolation with a \u201cprotectionist\u201d\nattitude. Policymakers, for their part, are not sufficiently aware of the benefits of GIS technology.\n\n- Workshop participants also observed that the development of national GIS capacity has been driven by a\n\u201cproject-oriented\u201d mentality that has influenced\ndevelopment policy in general in Burkina Faso. The\nexpansion of GIS applications has been based in\nisolated projects rather than proceeding according to\na strategic plan or holistic vision. Consequently,\ncertain key institutional and policy issues have not\nbeen properly addressed, such as the production of\ncore datasets and the emergence of a national synergy around geo-information management.\n\n**Overview of Case Studies: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire**\n\nFive cases of GIS applications in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire were\nprepared for this study and reviewed at a national\nworkshop held in December 1999. These cases focused\non GIS activities within projects addressing diverse\npolicy issues: road network management, health sector\ninfrastructure, urban management, management and\ntaxation of forest concessions, and integration of regional development processes into national development planning.\n\nEach of the projects took place in the mid- to late\n\n\n-----\n\n10                    GIS: SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IN WEST AFRICA\n\n\nrelevant national government agencies (dealing with\nroads, public health, forests, etc.).",

It is a recursive dynamic model, unlike\nintertemporal optimization models, which assume that\nagents know the future with certainty when they make\n\n\ndecisions.

However, in the high-ambition scenarios, the EV\nsales mandate plays a more important role because it helps\ntransform the fleet from ICEVs to EVs.\n\nNote that the contributions of policies to total emissions reduction reported here are a result of the policy\npackage chosen for each scenario, their implementation\nschedule, and the chosen stringency of the policy.",

In the United States, 70 percent of\nthe EV tax credits went to households that would have\nbought an EV anyway. These EVs replaced vehicles with\nabove-average fuel efficiency (Xing et al. 2019), and they\nwere often a second or third vehicle that would be driven\nless and/or replace a more fuel-efficient vehicle (Bauer et\n\n\nal. 2021; Rajagopal and Phadke 2019). Meanwhile, lowerincome households often own older, fewer, and less fuelefficient vehicles, so they use each one more intensively,\neven if they are not a ride-hailing driver. Lower-income\nhouseholds also have more financial need for the subsidy,\nand targeting EV subsidies to them could help alleviate\nair and noise pollution in disadvantaged communities\n(Rajagopal and Phadke 2019). In California, households\nin disadvantaged communities captured only 6 percent of\nthe rebates for BEVs, in part because they may not have\nowed enough taxes to take advantage of the full tax credit\n(Rajagopal and Phadke 2019). There are growing calls to\ntarget policies to lower-income households or high-mile\u00ad\nage vehicles (Rajagopal and Phadke 2019; Sheldon and\nDua 2019; Xing et al. 2019).

The Open Foris suite of tools is a set of publicly available, open-source software to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis,\nand reporting for field and satellite data. Collect Earth is a data collection tool that is part of the Open Foris suite, where users can analyze high- and very-high-resolution satellite imagery in\ncombination with other available remotely sensed data to monitor the state and change of land use/land (Bey et al. 2016). Built on Google Earth Pro and Google Earth Engine cloud computing\ntechnologies, Collect Earth facilitates access to multiple publicly available archives of satellite imagery, including archives with very high spatial and temporal resolution imagery (e.g.,\nDigitalGlobe, Spot 5 and 6, Landsat, Sentinel-2) via Google Earth, Bing Maps, and Google Earth Engine (Bey et al. 2016). Collect Earth can be used for many purposes, including monitoring forest\nand landscape restoration; providing data for REDD+ Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems; conducting national forest inventories, disaster assessments, and humanitarian\nwork; and more. Users can configure the data collection form, sampling design, plot size, temporal range, and scale to match each purpose (Bey et al. 2016). For example, in 2017, Collect Earth\nwas used via a series of mapathons conducted around the world to assess the extent of forest area in the world\u2019s drylands\u2014a biome that has been historically underrepresented in forest\ncover estimates\u2014which led to a 9 percent increase in the estimate of global forest cover (Bastin et al. 2017).\n\nCollect Earth Online, launched in December 2018, is a web-based version of Collect Earth that performs all data collection and management functions online, eliminating the need for desktop\nsoftware installation (Saah et al. 2019).

Thirteen classes were adapted from the national land use/land\ncover classes to reflect restoration targets (e.g., high forest versus dense woodland) and the national restoration\noptions (MEFCC 2018).\n\n2. \u0007Percent tree cover\u2014to assess the presence and distribution of trees throughout the woreda (i.e., across all land\nuse/land cover classes) by land use/land cover class on land treated with restoration interventions and in gullies.\n\n3. \u0007Spatial distribution of trees\u2014to assess the specific spatial distribution (i.e., scattered, clustered, linear pattern,\nand regular pattern) of trees in cropland, grassland, rural compound, and settlement.\n\n4. \u0007Percent of linear features with tree canopy\u2014to assess the presence of trees along specific linear features\n(i.e., waterbody banks, boundaries, bunds/terraces, roadsides, and gully banks).",

These challenges include loss of\nnatural forests, high dependence on fuelwood, lack of\ncommon land and pastureland, and declining productivity\nof agriculture land (Singh et al. 2020).\n\nStakeholders also informed us that landscape restoration\ninterventions such as agroforestry and farm forestry\nare already being practiced in the district for a range of\nbenefits including erosion control and provisioning of\nfodder and fuelwood. Survey indicators for the mapathon\nwere therefore designed to collect information on the\nlandscape, which would aid in planning landscape\nrestoration for multiple ecosystem services in the district.\nSince collecting indicators data required deep knowledge\nof the landscape, stakeholders from Sidhi were invited\nto participate in the mapathon.

The\ncontent and amount of time spent on training\nwill depend on the data collectors\u2019 levels of\n\n\nexperience. It is important to spend time not just\non how to operate the Collect Earth survey, but\nalso on how to interpret very-high-resolution\nsatellite imagery (e.g., DigitalGlobe images).\n\nLandscape features look different when viewed\nfrom the top-down perspective of satellite\nimagery versus what is seen on the ground.\nEven if data collectors are highly familiar\nwith the area of interest, it helps to walk them\nthrough how to interpret imagery to identify\nvarious land use/land cover types and landscape\nfeatures. Exploring the imagery in Google Earth,\nBing Maps, or another source or providing\nscreenshots of imagery from the landscape will\nhelp familiarize the data collectors with how\nfeatures will appear when conducting the survey.\nIt will also help increase consistency across\ndata collectors.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that seasonality\nmay affect how land presents itself. When\n\n\npossible, engage stakeholders that know how\nseasons affect the land and water bodies and\ntrain data collectors using examples of imagery\nfrom different times of the year. For example,\ntrees may lose leaves or water bodies may be dry\nduring certain seasons; therefore, it is important\nto understand how the date of the imagery may\naffect interpretation.\n\nThe following images from India and Rwanda\nprovide examples of imagery interpretation\n(Figures 17\u201323). In India\u2019s Sidhi District,\nparticipants from the landscape did not have\nexperience viewing satellite imagery.

There are examples of crop infestations\nby insects that are resistant to one Bt protein, but no evidence of Bt resistance to crops with a broader range of Bt\nproteins. Breeding multiple Bt proteins into crops should\nreduce the likelihood of resistance, because even genetic\nmutations that lead to resistance to one Bt protein will not\ngive those pests an advantage as they will remain vulnerable to the other Bt proteins.[35]\n\nIn contrast, glyphosate resistance is developing rapidly\nand has now spread to 24 weeds.[36] In some areas, glyphosate-resistant weeds have become an expensive problem,[37]\nand trying to overwhelm resistance has led to a large\nrise in the total quantity of glyphosate applied.[38] In part\nbecause of this resistance, chemical companies are trying\nto develop crops that are resistant to even more toxic pesticides, such as 2,4-D, which would be applied along with\nglyphosate.

Coal becomes even more critical when cost of\nelectricity and security of supply issues are viewed in light of\nother fuel sources such as gas or uranium. Yet coal combustion\nproduces about 1.9 billion tons of CO2 per year in the U.S.,\nroughly equivalent to all CO2 emissions from U.S. transport\nper annum. The burning of coal, with more CO2 emissions per\nunit of energy produced than any other fossil fuel, has significant adverse climate change impacts.\nOne way to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power\nis to capture and store it permanently underground, a process\ncalled carbon capture and storage (CCS), also called carbon\nsequestration. CCS has captured the attention of policymakers,\npower generators, and environmentalists because of its potential as a bridging technology that will permit the continued\nuse of coal as a fuel source while not contributing to a further\ndestabilization of the climate. A great deal of work is underway\nto develop and improve the technologies, legal frameworks, and\npolicies required for wide-scale deployment of CCS systems.\nThe main reason for this interest is that several major world\neconomies, including the U.S., China, and India depend heavily on coal as an energy source. Alternative means of moving to\na zero-carbon power mix, including wind or solar (which are\ndispersed and have variable output) and nuclear power (which\nraises difficult questions of security and waste disposal) require\nwrenching changes to our energy systems. CCS apparently\noffers the prospect of staving off climate disaster while maintaining something near the status quo. Coal can remain central\nto the energy mix, and CCS makes this possible.\n\n\nBut does it? There is in fact considerable complexity involved\nin deploying a national CCS system at the scale necessary to\nachieve significant emissions reductions. Indeed, it amounts to\nno less fundamental a transformation of the country\u2019s energy\ninfrastructure than would a huge-scale adoption of wind\nenergy, for instance. The objective of this paper is to examine\nthe challenges of this transformation under the four broad categories of technology, policy, legal and regulatory framework,\nand investment, and their implications for CCS as part of the\nsolution to mitigate adverse climate change impacts.\n\n\n-----",

Interviews were\nconducted in a semi-structured format over the phone and in person\nbetween November 2018 and April 2019. Field notes were collected, and\nconversations recorded when permission was granted; all direct quotes as\nthey appear in this work are based on transcribed recordings. Interviews\ntargeted a range of actors who operate in this space and who can be\ncategorized at a base level as private sector and nonprivate sector actors.\nGiven that the main research question is formulated around the barriers\nfaced by companies seeking to adopt a science-based climate policy\nagenda, it was important to pursue direct insight from this category of\nactors. However, noncompany, third-party actors are equally important\nsources on this topic. Institutions are playing an increasingly central\nrole in this space, either shining a light on what they consider to be poor\nbehavior or convening and supporting companies to carry out progressive\nwork on this topic. Additionally, because third-party actors often work\nwith multiple companies simultaneously, they tend to have a unique\nperspective on trends.\n\nIt should be noted that due to the nature of career mobility in this space,\nmany participants interviewed for this project fall into more than one\ncategory, having worked in both the private and public or nonprofit sectors\n\nTable A1 | Criteria for Company Selection\n\n\nover the course of their career, or having worked across multiple companies\nor institutions of a similar type. This blurring of categories is considered a\nstrength of the research process, as participants were able to bring multiple\nperspectives to the conversations. Participants are classified either by their\ncurrent role and organization, or the perspective they spoke from if that\ndiffered from their current position.",

We\nidentified just 15 of 89 studies that trialed interventions to encourage more sustainable plant-rich diets\nspecifically. Considering this subset, nearly all studies involved interventions classified under Presentation (e.g., menu engineering approaches and dish\nlabeling, 11 studies), either alone (9 studies) or in\ncombination with Presentation (1 study) or Product\ninterventions (e.g., reduce the portion size of meat,\n1 study). Two studies researched Product interventions, one looked at a Placement intervention (e.g.,\nchanging the order of products in buffets), and one\nat a Promotion intervention (e.g., posters communicating the environmental impact of different\nfoods). We were unable to locate any research that\nhas specifically tested the effect of People interventions with the express purpose of producing a\ndietary shift away from meat and toward plant-rich\noptions in food service settings.\n\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, 9 of the 11 Presentation\ninterventions were effective at encouraging diners\nto choose more sustainable plant-rich dishes, indicating that this strategy can promote the desired\ndietary shift. Given the small number of studies\nthat researched other 5P intervention categories, we\nrefrain from commenting further on the strength\nof the evidence until research accumulates in this\narea.\n\nWe also refrain from stating with certainty which\nof the 57 individual interventions listed in Table 1\nare effective at promoting plant-rich choices in food\nservice. This is both because of the lack of relevant\nresearch evidence, as noted above, and because\nmany of the 57 interventions were delivered as\npart of \u201cmulticomponent\u201d packages (e.g., multiple\ninterventions implemented at the same time). This\napproach makes it very difficult to pick apart which\nelement in a package is responsible for any changes\nin observed diner behavior (or lack thereof).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe do, however, point the interested reader toward\nexisting academic literature reviews that have\nattempted to determine the effectiveness of specific behavior change interventions to encourage\na reduction in meat consumption.

Do alternative incentive schemes other than\ninput and output subsidies exist to increase\nland productivity and rural income while\nreducing negative environmental impacts?\n\nThe report shows where existing agricultural\npolicy incentives or subsidies have fallen short of\ntheir objectives, failing to increase agricultural\nproductivity, boost rural incomes, or improve\nfood security. Additionally, it also demonstrates,\nthrough country examples, where innovative\npolicy incentives have effectively encouraged the\nadoption of sustainable agricultural and land use\npractices, such as landscape restoration. Restoration practices can improve soil health and lead\nto a global average increases in crop yields of 2\npercent by 2050 compared to a baseline scenario,[1]\nwith significant increase in agricultural productivity in the Middle East and North Africa (10\npercent), Central and South America (5 percent),\nand sub-Saharan Africa (5 percent) (PBL 2021).\n\nWe posit that by shifting underperforming agricultural subsidies to protect and restore degraded\nfarmland, they can better support local communities and help countries achieve their climate,\nbiodiversity, and rural development goals. The\nreport highlights programs in Africa, Asia, and\nLatin America that have followed this path toward\nsustainability and makes key recommendations\nintended to help policymakers create balanced\nand restorative agricultural subsidies.

Policy solutions\nthat aim to improve the distribution of agricultural subsidies and farmers\u2019 incomes should pay\nparticular attention to three factors (Kherallah\net al. 2002; Searchinger et al. 2020). First, a lack\n\n\nof cash and credit has limited the adoption and\nuse of fertilizer among the poorest farmers with\nlow cash income. Second, fertilizer use tends to\nbe concentrated in the high-potential zones with\ngreater rainfall and better soils, which are often\nthe places with economic advantages as well.\nThird, the lack of land ownership among smallholder farmers also has constrained their eligibility to receive aid, as subsidies tied to outputs or\ninputs (for seeds, fertilizer, water, electricity, etc.)\nare designed to reduce costs for landowners.\n\nIn response, policy design must incorporate\nmechanisms that can ensure that subsidy benefits\neffectively reach the intended program beneficiaries. Governments can consider raising the overall\nsupply of formally traded fertilizer in economically disadvantaged areas to increase access. But\nit is equally important that governments assume a\nrole in facilitating distribution of fertilizer to some\nof the poorest and most remote areas and providing technical assistance to encourage adequate\napplication of fertilizer on individual farms.\nMoreover, more rigorous participation requirements and limits on subsidized fertilizer distribution may be needed to ensure that small and\nmarginal farmers can access the program. Finally,\ngovernments need to continue efforts to improve\nrecognition of land rights for small farmers.",
        "c2c16c1a-c744-43d9-95cf-af07703e46fa": "###### Restoring degraded land can contribute directly to local economies but is largely underfunded\n\nTo reverse this trend, a number of initiatives have\nbeen developed. The Bonn Challenge, launched\nin 2011, is a global effort to restore 150 million\nhectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded\nland by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030.\nSince its inception, the Bonn Challenge, through\nits regional initiatives such as the African Forest\nLandscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) and\nInitiative 20x20 in Latin America and the Caribbean, has attracted commitments from national\ngovernments, states, and regional programs to\nrestore about 210 million hectares of land and has\nleveraged billions of dollars of public and private\nfinance for implementation on the ground (Bonn\nChallenge n.d.).\n\nLand restoration interventions are very broad,\nranging from active restoration\u2014such as reforestation, forest conservation, agroforestry and\nsilvopastoral practices, and soil conservation\npractices\u2014to passive restoration, such as farmermanaged natural regeneration and natural forest\nregrowth (Ding et al. 2017). Revitalizing 150 million hectares of degraded agricultural land could\ngenerate $85 billion in net benefits to national\nand local economies (GCEC 2014). About 90 percent of this value is market-related, providing $30\nbillion to $40 billion a year in extra income for\nsmallholder farmers and additional food for close\nto 200 million people (GCEC 2014). Additionally, restoration interventions can also generate\nimportant ecosystem benefits. It is expected that\nachieving the 350-million-hectare goal would\ngenerate about $170 billion a year in net benefits\nfrom watershed protection and improved crop\nyields. The resulting forest products could also\nsequester up to 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide\nequivalent annually (BonnChallenge n.d.).",

As of\n2017, 17 of Brazil\u2019s 26 states had adopted EFTs\n(Droste et al. 2017a).\n\nBrazil\u2019s EFTs have received international attention (May et al. 2002; Ring 2008; Farley et\nal. 2010) and have been replicated in France,\nGermany, India, Indonesia, Portugal, and Switzerland (Droste et al. 2018). Droste et al. (2017b)\nestimated the effects on conservation decisions of\nPortugal\u2019s introducing EFTs in 2007 and found\nthat it led to an increase in the share of protected\nareas at both municipal and national levels. The\ngrants that Indian finance commissions have\ngiven directly to panchayats (the lowest tier of\ngovernance) are another example of this transfer.\nAlthough until now the funds have been directed\nonly to improving drinking water, rainwater harvesting, sanitation, and so on, similar funds could\nbe created to target forest or soil restoration.\n\nAdditionally, EFTs can be managed by agriculture, planning, finance, or rural development\nministries or departments. A state-level analysis\nby WRI India shows that some states have used\nEFTs innovatively to maintain and enhance forest\nand tree cover through the forestry and other\nministries (Gangwal et al. 2019). For instance, in\nMaharashtra, the state government has increased\nsupport through an EFT to the Department of\nTribal Affairs for enhancing the capacity of tribal\ncommunities to protect and restore forest cover\nin areas where community forest rights have\nbeen recognized. The case of India highlights the\npossible fiscal transfers that different government\ndepartments can use to support their common\ngoal of increasing tree cover in rural areas.\n\nEFTs have the potential to mobilize public finance\nfor financing programs that help restore the ecosystem functions of agricultural land, such as soil\nand water retention, regulating the local water\ncycle, and moderating climate change, which in\nturn can boost agricultural productivity.",

In the first case, accounted\nemissions are adjusted for ITMOs. In the second,\naccounted emissions are adjusted for both ITMOs and\nchanges in net land sector emissions/removals. The\nquantity of emissions is compared with the target level of\nemissions to determine whether the mitigation target has\nbeen achieved.\n\nThere is a spectrum of complexity related to calculating\naccounted emissions, depending on target design and\naccounting choices (Figure 3-3). The calculation is very\nsimple for fixed-year targets and base year emissions\ntargets in cases where ITMOs are not used and inventory\napproaches are used for the land sector. In this case,\ncalculating accounted emissions mirrors an inventory\napproach, as accounted emissions are simply the target\nyear\u2019s emissions in the target boundary. The calculation\nis most complex for baseline scenario targets in which\nITMOs are used and accounting approaches are used\nfor the land sector that differ from inventory-based\napproaches.

Some of the identi\u00ad\nfied issues may be attributable to the fact that Japanese\nFSF contains a very large number of projects from various\nchanneling institutions, making it difficult for the govern\u00ad\nment to obtain a clear overview of Japanese FSF.\n\nA substantial challenge is that information on FSF is utterly\ndisaggregated. This reflects the limitations of standard\ngovernment reporting on ODA and OOF. Most of the cli\u00ad\nmate finance projects could not be easily identified without\nextensive key word research on the websites of implement\u00ad\ning agencies. The two submissions to UNFCCC only list\nsome 120 out of total 783 projects, covering just over USD 2\nbillion of total of more than USD 13.2 billion committed by\n29 February 2012. Given the strong interest in improving\ntransparency on the delivery of climate finance commit\u00ad\n\n\n-----\n\nments, there may be a case to be made to the government\nfor further strengthening reporting on its FSF contribution.\nIn this study, we identified about 250 likely FSF projects,\namounting up to USD 11.7 billion or nearly 90% of the\namount committed by 29 February 2012. At the same time,\nmore than 500 FSF projects remained unidentified. This\nmakes it difficult to reach insights into the regional distribu\u00ad\ntion of projects as well as the distribution of project types.\nAs a result, the full impact of the government\u2019s contribution\nis not sufficiently understood by its intended recipients.\n\nOnce the projects were identified, it was often possible\nto gather part of the information required for the pres\u00ad\nent assessment. Nevertheless, none of the official FSF\ndocuments provide links to other official documents and\ninformation sources regarding FSF that even identifying\ninformation sources on FSF was already challenging.\nSome key information such as recipient institutions and\ndisbursement status are currently lacking in all official\nFSF documents.

These lessons are particularly pertinent to\ndonor governments as they consider how to best spend\ntheir limited climate finance and define the role of existing\nand future institutions in the climate finance architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\nA critical issue gleaned from the analysis is the limited\nprivate sector co-investment in PPCFIs at the fund level,\nand ongoing struggles to disburse funds quickly enough to\nprivate sector projects. These challenges are partly driven\nby systemic factors such as weak enabling conditions to\nattract private investment in low-carbon and climateresilient markets. Even without addressing these bigger\nissues, PPCFIs and supporting institutions can tackle\neasier operational and institutional challenges. Solutions\nto these smaller challenges include providing collective\ninformation to the private sector, improving access to\nfinance, and standardizing requirements while maintaining appropriate safeguards.\n\nWhile some supporting institutions are making efforts\nto improve coordination and collaboration of PPCFIs\nthrough forums for dialogue, pooling of resources in some\nPPCFIs, or by supporting complementary activities, these\nefforts have been limited in scope. Competition among\ndonors and supporting institutions, and their respective\npolitical and legal mandates limit their ability to be flexible\nand innovative as a collective unit. Also, the lack of incentives for any one institution to take the lead in promoting\ncollaboration impedes collaboration across the board.",

Therefore, donors and\npublic financial institutions must avoid duplication of\nefforts, address finance gaps, enable recipient countries to\nmore efficiently access funds, and allow them to program\nresources effectively.\n\nCollective action and a sense of partnership among donors\nand other financial institutions will be necessary to scale\nclimate investments, achieve the scale of resources across\na range of countries and sectors that need substantial\ninvestments to address the climate change challenge, and\nenable developing countries to shift toward low-carbon,\nclimate resilient development.\n\n\n-----",

PURPA requires utilities to purchase\npower from independent companies, under certain circumstances.\nThe design of PURPA does not, however, easily accommodate corporate buyers. Under the act, the utility, not the corporate buyer, is the\nultimate buyer of the renewable energy. Corporate buyers may be able to\npurchase the RECs from a PURPA project, but they cannot easily obtain\naccess to the fixed-price energy from the project, as that is sold to the\nutility for use by all ratepayers. For this reason, we have not identified\nPURPA as a central tool for corporate buyers to obtain access to renewable energy.\n\n2.

It shows a business-as-usual or base\ncase investment need of $89 trillion in energy, transport,\nwater and waste, and telecommunications in a 6DS. The\nreport cites estimates for base case investment needs in\ntransport at $13.67 trillion between 2015 and 2030 in\nroads, rail, airports, and ports. These estimates come from\nOECD reports mentioned earlier; the NCE report uses\nthe road investment projections from OECD 2006 and\nremaining transport investment projections from OECD\n2012. The main focus of this report is to assess the invest\n\nment needs in technological improvements required to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe report estimates $8.8 trillion incremental investment\nto achieve a low-carbon scenario by improving energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transport engines; out of\nthis, $3.5 trillion is the estimated incremental investment\nfor improving energy efficiency in the transport sector.\nThe incremental investment amounts are based on the\nIEA\u2019s Energy Technology Perspectives 2012. This estimate\nof incremental investment is also in line with the $3.7 billion figure quoted by the WEF for improving automotive\nvehicle engine efficiency to achieve a 2DS. The analysis\nput forth by the NCE suggests that an incremental investment in energy efficiency of infrastructure, coupled with\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelopment of other low-carbon technologies,[9] will result\nin cost savings in terms of capital and operating expenditure in infrastructure of around $9 trillion, as indicated in\nFigure 4 below by summing the bars \u201cReduced Capex in\nFossil Fuels,\u201d \u201cReduced Electricity T&D [transmission and\ndistribution],\u201d and \u201cReduced Capex in Compact Cities.\u201d\nThis resultant savings means that a low-carbon pathway\nrequires incremental infrastructure investment of\n\n\n$4 trillion between 2015 and 2030, an increase of less\nthan 5 percent on baseline levels.

The projections distinguish between\ncapital expenditure and spending needs for maintenance,\nwhich makes it easier to identify the investment needs for\ncapital projects for these subsectors.\n\nFor strategic transport infrastructure such as airports, ports\n(seaports and dryports), and interregional infrastructure,\nwe use the projections from Strategic Transport Infrastructure Needs to 2030 (OECD 2012) as this is the only\nglobal estimate covering these subsectors. From a climate\nscenario perspective on investment needs, this is not a\nperfect union, because the OECD does not specify a climate\nscenario, while IEA projections are based on the 2DS and\n4DS. Cumulative investment in airports, ports, and interregional infrastructure is $156 billion; that amounts to 6.6\npercent of the 4DS estimate and 7.7 percent of our 2DS\nestimate.

The 4DS\nestimate of $2.3 trillion is 15 percent higher than the 2DS\nestimate of $2 trillion, which shows that a low-carbon\ninvestment pathway that prioritizes sustainable transport\nwill cost less in the future. When compared to the global\ninvestment flows estimates of $1.4 trillion to $2.1 trillion\n(Lefevre and Leipziger 2014), the projected needs for a\n4DS lie outside the range of current financial means and\nindicate an investment gap of between $244 billion and\n$944 billion per year. In contrast, projected investment\nneeds to achieve a 2DS lie within the current flows range\nof $1.4 trillion to $2.1 trillion. Thus, on a global scale, current financial flows could be adequate to meet the future\ntransport infrastructure needs under a 2DS pathway. If\nwe assume that the financial flows lie at the lower end,\nthat is, $1.4 trillion, the maximum shortfall for the 2DS is\n$633 billion, which is $311 billion less than the maximum\nshortfall under the 4DS.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 | \u0007A 2DS Pathway is Within Current Financial Flows",

Their policy\nand public investment decisions will frame the market and\ndrive private investment. On a domestic level, policy leaders such as ministers of finance, ministers of transport, or\ndirectors of national development banks need to shift their\ninvolvement and portfolios in transport to support a lowcarbon pathway. Multilateral development banks can do\nthe same, setting trends on low-carbon portfolio allocation,\nincentivizing and supporting more sustainable decisions by\nnational and local decision makers.\n\nIn order to facilitate better decision-making that helps\ndivert funds toward more sustainable modes of transport,\nthere is still a need for more data inputs, data that are\ncollected in a more systematic fashion and at the appropriate level of analysis. Once there is similar analysis and\nimproved data on investment flows and needs available\non national and regional levels, policymakers, investors\n(private, public, domestic, and ODA), and researchers can\ndirect their efforts in a more focused manner.

The vertical\napproach has to do with the region\u2019s internal factors and entails determining\nwhether the infrastructure stock and investment match the demand generated by\neconomic activity. The horizontal approach is based on achieving a certain level\nof development to meet the gap based on relative benchmarks. To determine\nthe horizontal infrastructure gap in LAC, the authors compared the per capita\ninfrastructure stock of LAC with a group of East Asian countries including Hong\nKong, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. The study includes the following infrastructure sectors: electricity, telecommunications (fixed lines, mobile\nphones, and fixed broadband access), surface transport (paved roads and railways), and water and sanitation. The respective estimated infrastructure needs\ntranslate to $216 billion and $328 billion (in 2010 dollars) annually based on the\nvertical[17] and horizontal[18] gaps identified by IADB 2011.[19 ]\n\nThe study only includes paved roads and railroad investment needs for the\ntransport sector. The vertical gap analysis suggests that paved roads require\n$42 billion annually, out of which $19 billion is for capital investment and the\nremaining $23 billion is for maintenance. It also quantifies investment needs for\nrailroads at $6 billion, all of which will be spent on maintenance. The horizontal\ngap analysis suggests that in order to achieve the same provision of paved roads\nand railways per capita as the East Asian group of countries, LAC will need $124\nbillion and $9 billion for new roads and railways, respectively.",

Recognizing that in some**\ncircumstances, livestock production will remain the most\nclimate-resilient livelihood, the severity of climate change\nin some areas may mean that farmers and herders have\nto move away from culturally significant species to more\nclimate-resilient ones or, more drastically, out of livestock\nproduction.\n\n**Significantly more data, research, and analysis**\n**are needed to accelerate and improve planning**\n**and implementation of transformations in the**\n**livestock sector that explicitly consider long-term**\nclimate risks. Although transformative adaptation is\nalready occurring in some contexts, it may not be explicitly called transformative, making it difficult to pinpoint\nprogress and identify obviously transformative examples.\nThis is compounded by the general dearth of research into\nlivestock adaptation.\n\n**Governments, funders, and research institutions**\n**should assess long-term climate impacts and vul-**\n**nerabilities while keeping transformative adapta-**\n**tion solutions in mind. According to climate projec-**\ntions, crop models, livestock models, disease models,\nand other data, transformative adaptation will be needed\nin the livestock sector in some regions. The sooner that\nthese actors evaluate their long-term climate impacts, the\nsooner they can plan for and implement transformative\nchanges while promoting smooth transitions.\n\n**Transformative adaptation in livestock produc-**\n**tion systems should simultaneously address**\n**resource sustainability and emissions reduction.**\nLivestock are significant emitters of GHGs, and their",

Beyond improving technologies and methodologies,\naddressing emissions in the livestock sector may mean\nreducing herd sizes and transitioning to alternative feed\nresources. It also means improving management of grazing lands and, in the commercial livestock sector, better\nmanagement of manure and other by-products of livestock\nproduction; for example, through biogas digesters.\n\n**In addition to incorporating transformative**\n**adaptation options for livestock in NAPs, NDCs,**\n**and other national planning processes, these**\n**options should be explicitly considered for sec-**\n**toral development plans and national budgets. The**\nlivestock sector is critical for food security, livelihoods,\neconomic growth, cultural traditions, and agro-ecosystems. Livestock sector development plans should explicitly\nconsider long-term climate impacts, land-use trade-offs,\nand GHG emissions and be linked to national budgeting\nmechanisms.\n\n**Sustained private-sector investment and public-**\n**private partnerships will be essential for transfor-**\n**mation of the livestock sector. Governments can also**\nensure that market incentives, including subsidies, public\nexpenditures, and taxation mechanisms in the livestock\nsector, support private-sector investment at the scale\nrequired.\n\n**Transformative approaches to adaptation in the**\n**livestock sector require careful considerations**\n**of social equity, given the deep cultural and tra-**\n**ditional ties to livestock in many regions. This**\nmeans strategically designing projects, programs, tools,\nand policies that address the needs and rights of women,\nindigenous people, the poor, and other marginalized\ngroups, especially when introducing new livestock species\nor feed sources.",

As with\nthe framework paper, this paper deliberately focuses on\ntop-down processes and does not cover ground-up efforts,\neven though many transformations within livestock production result from the autonomous actions that farmers\ntake. Given the critical role that farmers and other rural\npeople play, however, it is essential that top-down processes keep farmers\u2019 perspectives, needs, and constraints\nat their center (Carter et al. 2018).",
        "303bb921-bb3a-429e-a788-d51cd8b4aaa6": "Because of USDA\u2019s investment\nthrough the FEED project, as well as the commercial\nnature of the business that sustains it, infrastructure was\nalready in place, as were ingredient procurement and\ndistribution systems to respond to the drought. Unions\nworked double and even triple shifts to produce and ship\nfeed to affected farmers. The unions were able to distribute concentrate feed to more than 307,000 animals owned\nby almost 119,000 farmers. According to local interviews,\nnot a single animal receiving supplemental feed was lost.\nIn outside areas that were less affected and not part of\nthe FEED program, livestock productivity decreased; but\nthere were no animal deaths, migration, or forced livestock sales. This greatly contrasts with previous drought\nyears where, nationally, millions of animals died.\n\nAlthough FEED is most recognized for its cooperative\nunion-based feed enterprises, the project\u2019s contribution to\nresilience is not limited to that. It promotes the adoption\nof productive and nutritious, yet drought-resistant forages\nby farmers and practices such as hay making so a portion\nof the harvest can be used in the future\u2014for example, as\npart of the annual dry season feeding strategy, for commercial sale, or, when necessary, to cope with drought.\nSeed required to support increased production of these\nforages has come, in part, from nurseries established\nwith FEED assistance. The project has supported several\nsuccessful efforts to rehabilitate degraded grazing lands\nand helped surrounding communities implement management plans that increase both forage productivity and\nsustainability.",

The project is doing so by creating the infrastructure, both physical and human, on and off farm, that can\nrespond to changes in demand, including those created\nby climate shocks. In the context of livestock production\nand the key role that feed plays, this is the definition of\nresilience.\n\nThe FEED projects have thus far been transformative for\nclimate resilience by applying new methodologies (feed\ndistribution) and technologies (manufactured feed) at\nbroad geographical scale and fundamentally altering the\nagricultural landscape in the form of a new feed marketing system to reduce exclusive reliance on forage. The\nFEED projects have catalyzed a transformative pathway\nby using existing enabling conditions (i.e., the cooperative\nunion network) and sequencing incremental changes for\nalmost 10 years to aggregate outcomes for transformational change. Additionally, government support (from\nthe federal to district level), as well as alignment with\nthe national Growth and Transformation Plan (I and II)\nand the Livestock Master Plan, has promoted the FEED\nprogram\u2019s sustained presence and growth.\n\nDespite substantial gains, FEED still faces barriers related\nto union financial capacities, escalating feed prices, limited\nresearch and development infrastructure, a lack of a forage seed certification system, and competing government\nand NGO seed distribution. These barriers emphasize\nthe need for flexible transformative adaptation pathways\nthat respond to local conditions and constantly evolve to\novercome new (and old) challenges.",

The sections are meant\nto give a basic overview rather than an exhaustive review\nof all current practices and approaches. Instead, they are\nmeant to highlight three areas of livestock production that\nappear to be the most promising for transforming systems\nto be more resilient over the long term: breeding, feed and\nfodder, and transitions in system location or production\nfundamentals. For further details, please refer to the cited\ndocuments.\n\n\n-----\n\nBox 1 | The Case of Precision Livestock Breeding\n\n\nHeat stress is a serious issue that is affecting the productivity\nof livestock. Combining that with new emerging diseases\nand the need to feed 3 billion more people over the next\nthree decades, we are faced with serious issues that\ntraditional breeding methods cannot work quickly enough\nto solve. The University of Maryland College of Agriculture\nand Natural Resources, with support from the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation, is combining basic research and practical\napplication to address global issues. The College is working\non the development of new, cutting-edge precision breeding\ntechnologies for livestock, specifically focusing on cattle and\ngoats, to introduce traits that improve heat tolerance and\nincrease milk yield.\n\nTo incorporate one new trait into a population, many\ngenerations of breeding were traditionally needed, which\ncan take about 15 to 30 years, depending on the species.\nWith technologies such as CRISPR*/Cas9 allowing for easy\ngene editing, researchers are looking at what is known about\ngenetic fragments that are linked to specific desirable traits\nand how those traits can be input into a population in just a\nsingle generation of breeding, taking only 3 years instead of\n30.\n\n_*While clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic_\n_repeats (CRISPR) provides an important opportunity in terms_\n_of climate adaptation action, the European Court of Justice_\n_decided in July 2018 that plants created with CRISPR or other_\n_gene-editing tools should go through the same extensive_\n_regulatory process as earlier generations of genetically_\n_modified organisms. Many researchers predict that this_\n_decision will have a negative impact on biotechnology_\n_advancement and innovation for the development of more_\n_tolerant breeds._\n\n_Source: PRWEB 2018._",

Air quality\ninformation is still less well developed, especially\ninformation on the contribution of transport to overall\nair pollution levels.\n\nOur overall view of the sustainability of transport\n\nin these cities was pessimistic.

In this tropical band, biology, chemistry, and climate meet\n\n the exacting balance required for the survival of reef-building\n\n corals. Reef-building corals thrive in this delicate equilibrium,\n\n creating one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems in\n\n the world. Southeast Asia is the heart of this incredible diversity,\n\n holding more than 77 percent of the almost 800 reef-building\n\n coral species that have been described by scientists.\n\n People have coexisted with coral reef ecosystems in\n\n Southeast Asia for thousands of years. With more than 350\n\n million people living within 50 km of the coast,[1] coral reefs are\n\n important not only in local communities\u2019 cultures, but are also\n\n critical to the economic health of these nations.

WHAT IS A CORAL REEF?\n\n During the last several centuries and even today, corals have been mistaken for rocks or plants despite the fact that they are animals. In their\n\n simplest form, corals may only have a single polyp that has a tube-like body with a mouth on top that is surrounded by a ring of tentacles.\n\n In many coral species, these individual polyps form numerous, identical clones in dense formations called colonies.\n\n Although all coral species can use stinging tentacles to catch prey, most tropical corals obtain a large proportion of their food from a\n\n unique symbiosis. Living within the tissues of corals are thousands of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which derive energy directly\n\n from sunlight through photosynthesis. Corals can obtain much of their energy and oxygen requirements directly from zooxanthellae. In return,\n\n the algae receive shelter from predators and use the carbon dioxide produced by the corals in their metabolic processes. This tight association\n\n is highly efficient, allowing corals to survive and grow even in nutrient-poor waters. The success of this relationship can be seen in the great\n\n diversity and ancient lineage of corals, which first evolved over 200 million years ago.\n\n Many corals lay down some form of skeleton to support their simple bodies. Soft corals and fan corals have skeletons made of protein.\n\n However, those that build reefs are a subset of corals that lay down skeletons of calcium carbonate or limestone. These corals are mostly\n\n from the family Scleractinia and are sometimes known as hermatypic or reef-building. Today, almost 800 species of scleractinian corals have\n\n been described. Some reefs consist of small patches of coral and associated species, but others can be giant structures tens of kilometers wide.\n\n Although corals may dominate specific zones of reefs, seagrasses and other organisms are also essential components of reef structures.\n\n Stress from storms, added nutrients, and increased sedimentation can cause naturally coral-dominated zones to be replaced with algae.\n\n When algae overtake former coral zones, it is often a sign that the reef is unhealthy. Healthy coral reefs constitute the most diverse of all\n\n known marine ecosystems, with a greater array of life forms than any other ecosystem on the planet.",

They can also be acute, as in\n\n the case of blast fishing or a month of unusually warm water\n\n temperatures. Although coral reefs can adapt to chronic stresses\n\n in some cases, ongoing pressure prevents recovery from acute\n\n stresses and can result in lower levels of biodiversity.[16] In the\n\n past 20 years, coral bleaching associated with anomalous sea\n surface temperatures has also become a new major threat.
