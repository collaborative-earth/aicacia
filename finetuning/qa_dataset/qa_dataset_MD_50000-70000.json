Together, development banks**\n\ninvest more than US$2 trillion per year (AFD 2020a).\n\nKey DFIs, including multilateral development banks\n\nand the International Development Finance Club,[1] have\n\ncommitted to aligning their operations with the Paris\n\nAgreement. But, so far, they have focused on developing\n\nand implementing Paris alignment processes for direct\n\nfinancing\u2014that is, financing that goes directly to\n\nprojects like new infrastructure or agricultural initiatives.\n\n**Financial intermediary (FI) lending represents a**\n\n**substantial portion of overall lending for most of the 17**\n\n**DFIs analyzed in this working paper. These institutions**\n\n**have not yet developed Paris alignment criteria for**\n\n**FI investments.[2]** For example, at the International\n\nFinance Corporation (IFC), more than 60 percent of all\n\ncommitments are channeled through intermediaries. At\n\nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n\nand European Investment Bank (EIB), about a third of all\n\ncommitments are channeled through FIs.

At the subproject level, FIs would adopt**\n\ncriteria to ensure that their investments are consistent\n\nwith the Paris Agreement\u2019s global mitigation and\n\nadaptation goals.

We felt it necessary to extend our\nstudy to a 2 km radius to understand the real estate\nmarket in the area. Although nearly half the plots\nwithin a radius of 2 km remain vacant in the area,\nthe emerging real estate growth here is caused by\nspeculation on the upcoming metro connectivity\n(Figure 15). This is reflected in the form of land-use\nchange from rural to urban (residential, commercial,\nand industrial), which has occurred only during the\nlast decade. Presently, a large number of plots in\nThalagattapura are still agricultural. With the current\ntrend of residential and commercial developments\nin the area, we can reasonably predict more rural\nto urban land-use conversions in the future.\n\n**Impact of metro on real estate developments:**\nThe prospects of metro rail have led to a slow\ntransformation of the real estate market through\n\n\nlow-rise developments in Thalagattapura.

More recently, a limited\nnumber of high-rise multi-family dwelling projects\nhave been constructed, demonstrating a potential\nchange in the real estate market of Thalagattapura,\na trend that is expected to continue. This growing\nreal estate market triggered by metro rail has good\nimplications for LVC. That said, the present state of\npublic infrastructure is relatively poor or absent, thus\ndiscouraging high-intensity real estate investments.\n\n\nFigure 16 | \u0007Low FAR Consumption Characterizes Development in Thalagattapura\n\n3500\n\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n\n0\n\n\nVacant Less than 1.5 1.5 to 2.25 2.25 to 2.7 2.7 to 4",

According to the FAO, the energy used for the\nglobal production, harvesting, transport, and packaging\nof wasted food\u2014amounting to about 1.3 billion tons\nannually\u2014generates around 3.3 billion tons of CO2,\nwhich would make it the third highest source of carbon\n\n\n-----\n\nemissions after the United States and China.[140] Similarly,\nSDG target 12.5 aims to substantially reduce waste\ngeneration by 2030 through waste prevention, reduction,\nrecycling, and reuse. Reducing waste generation will\ncontribute to decoupling waste generation from economic\ngrowth and can also produce significant climate benefits.[141]\n\nA number of countries\u2019 INDCs include mitigation options\nrelated to SCP for various sectors.

The RIP, with a budget of US$75 million, was\nimplemented from 2017 to 2022 in six regions and one city\nadministration in Ethiopia, covering 113 woredas (administrative units equivalent to districts). The second phase of the RIP\nprogram has been implemented since 2023. The RIP has three\nmain components: afforestation and reafforestation (FLR),\nreversing degradation and deforestation (DD), and forest sector transformation (FST), which is mandated to transform the\nforest sector through innovative models. This study focused on\nthe M&E system of the RIP\u2019s FLR component (RIP-FLR),\nwhich was implemented in 54 woredas.\n\nBased on the survey responses of the RIP-FLR project staff,\nthis study assessed staff technical capacity and competence,\nbudget allocation, knowledge management, management\nsupport, stakeholder engagement, and perception as factors\nthat influence the effectiveness of the M&E system. Data\nwere collected through an email questionnaire sent to the\nproject staff working in the project coordination offices at\nfederal, regional, and woreda levels. Email survey questionnaires were sent to 112 respondents and 66 (59 percent) were\nproperly completed and returned. Of the total valid responses,\n55 were from woreda offices, while 9 and 2 respondents were\nfrom the three regional and federal coordination offices,\nrespectively. More than 95 percent of the respondents were\nproject coordinators, foresters, or socioeconomists. Data were\n\n\ncollected as the responses of project staff to statements on a\nLikert scale. The collected data from the different geographic\nlocations were pooled and analyzed using descriptive statistics\nin the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 29. Examining the possible differences among\nthe different geographic locations was beyond the scope of\nthis research.",

Management\nsupport is critical for the credibility and acceptance of the\nM&E findings (Njama 2015). The effectiveness of the M&E\nsystem also relies on the presence of a knowledge management\nstructure and system that facilitates learning and the sharing\nof experiences (Odiwuor 2013). The perceptions of people\nwho carry out project M&E likewise influence the effectiveness of the M&E system. The views of the project staff may\ndiffer according to their cultural and social backgrounds and\naffect their roles and responsibilities in the work environment.\nMebrahtu (2002) noted the perception difference between\nsenior and junior staff members in M&E practices and roles,\nand its impact on the effectiveness of M&E systems. He\nnoted that high-ranking officials see M&E as a strategic tool\nfor informing decision-making, while junior staff perceive\nit either as a tool for evaluating their performance or as an\nadditional burden in their workload. These differing perspectives may be attributed to the varying levels of experience of\nthe two groups.\n\nAn effective M&E system is essential to the successful implementation of FLR projects, as it is for other development\nareas. To ensure the success of restoration efforts, it is crucial\nto monitor progress, detect any changes, and assess whether\nthey are in line with the initial management objectives (Perrow and Davy 2009). Effective M&E also helps track changes\nin biomass and infrastructure (de Jong et al. 1997) and\nmonitor establishment and survival, environmental values and\necosystem functions, and socioeconomic changes (Moges et\n\n\nal. 2021). FLR projects require effective M&E systems due to\nthe considerable time needed to restore degraded landscapes.\nEffective M&E can help avoid problems resulting from poor\ndesign and implementation of restoration interventions and\nprovide feedback for timely corrections (Nilsson et al. 2016).\nAnd yet, despite their value, FLR projects often lack effective\nM&E systems (Stanturf et al. 2014).",

The absence of an effective M&E\nsystem in Ethiopian FLR projects hampers the ability to track\nresults and generate credible evidence for adaptive learning.\nThe Ministry of Finance\u2019s report on the REDD+ Investment\nProgram (RIP), a flagship FLR program valued at US$75\nmillion, highlighted project management issues. These include\ninadequate project management skills to engage key partners and the absence of an effective M&E system (Ministry\nof Finance 2022).\n\nUnderstanding the processes and factors that make the\nM&E systems of FLR projects in Ethiopia more or less\neffective is crucial to identifying areas for improvement and\nbridging gaps. Strengthening the M&E system supports\nEthiopia\u2019s ongoing efforts to restore degraded lands through\ngovernment-led, ambitious restoration programs such as the\nGLI (2024). It is essential that a robust M&E system be put\nin place and regularly updated based on systematic research.\nAlthough research efforts in Ethiopia\u2019s regreening programs\nhave attempted to address the biophysical, social, and economic aspects of restoration, little attention has been paid to\nproject management aspects, particularly the effectiveness of\nM&E systems. This study specifically examined the M&E\nsystem of the FLR component within Ethiopia\u2019s REDD+\nInvestment Program (the RIP-FLR project). The purpose of\nthe study was to investigate the factors that determine the\neffectiveness of the M&E system in tracking the performance\nof the RIP-FLR project, and to provide recommendations to\npolicymakers, managers, project developers, and monitoring\nspecialists for designing and implementing a robust M&E\nsystem for FLR projects. The specific objectives of the study\nwere to evaluate project staff\u2019s rating of the effectiveness of the\nRIP-FLR project\u2019s M&E system and to assess major factors\nthat influence the effectiveness of that system.

In the system, quarterly and annual progress reports\nwere set to track physical and financial progress. Regular\nmonitoring involved local technicians and regional coordination offices, with annual learning events aimed at facilitating\nthe sharing of lessons learned. Midterm and final evaluations\nwere set to assess results and recommend measures to ensure\nlong-term sustainability, while annual joint monitoring\nmissions engaged a broader range of stakeholders. The M&E\nplan was designed to track indicators across afforestation,\ndeforestation, sector transformation, and partnerships.

However, the Likert rating was assigned in reverse\norder for the perception factor, with the highest value indicating strong disagreement, as the questions were phrased in the\nnegative form (i.e., higher values indicated more favorable\nresponses). The survey was designed on KoboToolbox and sent\nto selected respondents via email. Email surveys are costeffective and suitable for researchers with limited resources\n(Michaelidou and Dibb 2006; Simsek 1999). The study sur\n\nveyed project staff who had relevant information on the M&E\nsystem of the RIP-FLR project. According to Kumar (2012)\nand Saunders et al. (2009), researchers should approach people\nwho have the required information and are willing to share it.\nTherefore, project coordinators, foresters, and socioeconomic\nexperts of the RIP-FLR project participated in the survey, as\nthey are the primary technical experts in the project offices.\nPrior to distribution to the respondents, the questionnaires\nwere shared with selected project management experts who\nhave experience in FLR and M&E for feedback and adjustments were made accordingly.\n\nA survey questionnaire, created on KoboToolbox, was emailed\nto a random sample of 112 staff members from the project\ncoordination offices at woreda, regional, and federal levels.\nThese offices have a total of 128 staff members. As mentioned\nin the research design subsection above, woredas were selected\nusing a stratified random sampling technique. All respondents\nwere full-time employees of the RIP-FLR project offices\nat various levels. Of the 112 selected respondents, 92 (82\npercent) responded, but only 66 responses (59 percent) were\ncomplete and consistent.

We depend on ecosystems to\nsustain us, but the continued health of ecosystems depends,\nin turn, on our use and care. Ecosystems are the productive\nengines of the planet, providing us with everything from the\nwater we drink to the food we eat and the fiber we use for\nclothing, paper, or lumber. Yet, nearly every measure we use\nto assess the health of ecosystems tells us we are drawing on\nthem more than ever and degrading them, in some cases at\nan accelerating pace.\nOur knowledge of ecosystems has increased dramatically\nin recent decades, but it has not kept pace with our ability to\nalter them. Economic development and human well-being will\ndepend in large part on our ability to manage ecosystems\nmore sustainably. We must learn to evaluate our decisions on\nland and resource use in terms of how they affect the capacity of ecosystems to sustain life \u2014 not only human life, but\nalso the health and productive potential of plants, animals,\nand natural systems.\nA critical step in improving the way we manage the earth\u2019s\necosystems is to take stock of their extent, their condition,\nand their capacity to provide the goods and services we will\nneed in years to come. To date, no such comprehensive assessment of the state of the world\u2019s ecosystems has been undertaken.\nThe Pilot Analysis of Global Ecosystems (PAGE) begins\nto address this gap. This study is the result of a remarkable\ncollaborative effort between the World Resources Institute\n(WRI), the International Food Policy Research Institute\n(IFPRI), intergovernmental organizations, agencies, research\ninstitutes, and individual experts in more than 25 countries\nworldwide. The PAGE compares information already available on a global scale about the condition of five major classes\nof ecosystems: agroecosystems, coastal areas, forests, freshwater systems, and grasslands. IFPRI led the agroecosystem\nanalysis, while the others were led by WRI. The pilot analysis examines not only the quantity and quality of outputs but\nalso the biological basis for production, including soil and\nwater condition, biodiversity, and changes in land use over\ntime. Rather than looking just at marketed products, such as\nfood and timber, the study also analyzes the condition of a",

Agriculture has expanded at the expense of grasslands and forests, engineering projects have\naltered the hydrological regime of most of the world\u2019s major\nrivers, settlement and other forms of development have converted habitats around the world\u2019s coastlines. Human activities have adversely altered the earth\u2019s most important biogeochemical cycles \u2014 the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles\n\u2014 on which all life forms depend. Intensive management\nregimes and infrastructure development have contributed\npositively to providing some goods and services, such as food\nand fiber from forest plantations. They have also led to habitat fragmentation, pollution, and increased ecosystem vulnerability to pest attack, fires, and invasion by non-native\nspecies. Information is often incomplete and the picture confused, but there are many signs that the overall capacity of\necosystems to continue to produce many of the goods and\nservices on which we depend is declining.\nThe results of the PAGE are summarized in World Resources\n_2000\u20132001, a biennial report on the global environment pub-_\nlished by the World Resources Institute in partnership with\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Bank. These\ninstitutions have affirmed their commitment to making the\nviability of the world\u2019s ecosystems a critical development priority for the 21st century. WRI and its partners began work\nwith a conviction that the challenge of managing earth\u2019s ecosystems \u2014 and the consequences of failure \u2014 will increase\nsignificantly in coming decades. We end with a keen awareness that the scientific knowledge and political will required\nto meet this challenge are often lacking today. To make sound\necosystem management decisions in the future, significant\nchanges are needed in the way we use the knowledge and\nexperience at hand, as well as the range of information brought\nto bear on resource management decisions.\nA truly comprehensive and integrated assessment of global ecosystems that goes well beyond our pilot analysis is\nnecessary to meet information needs and to catalyze regional",

In 1998, representatives from international scientific and political bodies began to explore the merits of, and recommend the structure\nfor, such an assessment. After consulting for a year and considering the preliminary findings of the PAGE report, they\nconcluded that an international scientific assessment of the\npresent and likely future condition of the world\u2019s ecosystems\nwas both feasible and urgently needed. They urged local,\nnational, and international institutions to support the effort\nas stakeholders, users, and sources of expertise. If concluded\nsuccessfully, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment will generate new information, integrate current knowledge, develop\nmethodological tools, and increase public understanding.\nHuman dominance of the earth\u2019s productive systems gives\nus enormous responsibilities, but great opportunities as well.\nThe challenge for the 21st century is to understand the vulnerabilities and resilience of ecosystems, so that we can find\nways to reconcile the demands of human development with\nthe tolerances of nature.\n\n\nWe deeply appreciate support for this project from the\nAustralian Centre for International Agricultural Research,\nThe David and Lucile Packard Foundation, The Netherlands\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment\nProgramme, the Global Bureau of the United States Agency\nfor International Development, and The World Bank.\nA special thank you goes to the AVINA Foundation, the\nGlobal Environment Facility, and the United Nations Fund\nfor International Partnerships for their early support of PAGE\nand the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which was instrumental in launching our efforts.\n\nJONATHAN LASH\nPresident\nWorld Resources Institute\n\n\n-----",

We analyze datasets primarily\nat the global level, presenting quantitative indicators and qualitative information on the condition of the world\u2019s grasslands.\nGrassland condition is defined in terms of the current and future capacity of these ecosystems to provide goods and services\nimportant to humans.\n\n**GRASSLAND EXTENT, CHANGE, AND HUMAN**\n**MODIFICATION**\nPAGE analysts define grasslands as terrestrial ecosystems dominated by herbaceous and shrub vegetation and maintained by\nfire, grazing, drought and/or freezing temperatures. This definition includes vegetation covers with an abundance of non-woody\nplants and thus lumps together some savannas, woodlands,\nshrublands, and tundra, as well as more conventional grasslands. Our comprehensive view of grasslands allows us to make\nuse of a variety of global datasets and to avoid somewhat arbitrary distinctions among different land cover types. We examine the spatial extent of grasslands and modifications that have\naltered their extent, structure, and composition over time. Modifications include human-induced changes such as cultivation,\nurbanization, desertification, fire, livestock grazing, fragmentation, and introduction of invasive species.\n\n**GRASSLAND GOODS AND SERVICES**\nThis analysis focuses on a selected set of grassland goods and\nservices. Our choice was determined partly in consultation with\ngrassland experts worldwide and partly by availability of data.\nOur goal was to use global datasets, preferably in electronic\nform, available spatially and with time-series. Where global\ndata were not available, we used regional, national, and sometimes sub-national studies. The data and indicators presented",

The good or service also is discussed in terms of the\ntype of data required to expand our knowledge about the\necosystem\u2019s ability to provide the service. When quantitative\nindicators are available, we explore the potential to use them to\nevaluate the condition of grasslands. In other cases we present\nqualitative measures of condition, sometimes based entirely on\nexpert opinion.\nThis study attempts to locate and draw together global, spatially represented databases on grassland ecosystems. It is not\nan exhaustive review of literature available on grassland types.\nNor is it complete in its search for spatial datasets related to\ngrassland ecosystems. Some important goods and services provided by grasslands also have not been covered. For example,\nwoodfuel, often collected from shrublands or savannas, is not discussed in this report (but see the PAGE analysis on forest ecosystems), nor are the important services that grasslands provide in\nterms of water and nutrient cycling.

Areas of grassland before major modification by humans are now cultivated or urbanized, especially in North America and Europe. The indicators also suggest that although the major goods and services\nprovided by grasslands are in good to fair condition, the capacity for grassland ecosystems to continue to provide these goods\nand services is declining.\nIndicators of soil condition show that more than half of the\ngrassland area analyzed under PAGE has some degree of soil\ndegradation; over 5 percent of these grasslands are strongly to\nextremely degraded. Measures for detecting changes in net\nprimary productivity and rain-use efficiency show declines in\nsome grassland areas. Indicators of grassland biodiversity show\nmarked declines in grassland birds of North America, with negative effects from fragmentation and non-native species suggested\nfor this region and others. Although the carbon storage potential for grasslands is large, degraded areas store less carbon\nand there is heavy burning of some grassland areas, especially\nthe African savannas. Tourism and recreational activities in\ngrasslands appear to make important economic contributions\nto some countries, with revenues generally increasing. Overuse\nand declines in wildlife populations, however, suggest possible\ndeclines in the capacity to continue to provide these services.\nGlobal scale analysis of grassland condition is further complicated by our limited ability to detect responses of grassland\necosystems to degradation. On the global scale, we rarely detect degradation involving changes in the age structure of plant\npopulations or in the ability of species to reproduce. We might\ndetect a decrease in plant productivity and cover with current\nsatellite data and biomass measures. We can with certainty\ndetect a complete loss of vegetation and evidence of soil erosion through a combination of satellite data, data from meteorological stations, and relationships modeled with NPP and RUE\nmeasures.

Through\ngrazing, these animals stimulate regrowth of grasses and remove older, less productive plant tissue. The thinning of older\nplant tissue in turn leads to increased light absorption and more\nefficient use by younger plants, and improved soil moisture\n(Frank et al. 1998: 518).\nGrasslands and populations of wild ungulates have coexisted\nfor millions of years, their simultaneous emergence and adaptive radiation described as \u201camong the most thoroughly documented evolutionary patterns in the fossil record\u201d (Frank et al.\n1998: 519):\nThis long coevolutionary history between grasslands and\nungulates is testimony to the high sustainability of the grazing\necosystem. Key stabilizing elements of this habitat are the large\nspatial and temporal variation in mineral-rich forage; the migratory behavior of ungulates, which track high-quality forage\nacross a large region; and the intercalary meristem of grasses,\nwhich allows defoliated plants to regrow.\nA comparison of the grazing of grasslands by wild ungulates\nand domestic livestock underline important transformations in\ngrassland ecosystems. Domestic livestock are raised to maximize animal biomass through various techniques, including\nveterinary care and predator control, as well as water, mineral,\nand feed supplements. The result is generally higher biomass\nof domestic animals on pasture and rangelands than biomass of\nwild ungulates on grasslands (Frank et al. 1998: 519; Oesterheld\net al. 1992). In high densities, grazing animals can change floristic composition, structural characteristics of vegetation, reduce biodiversity, and increase soil erosion; in extreme situations, grazing may eliminate much vegetation cover (Evans 1998:\n263).",

ASSOD, however, places more\nemphasis on trends of degradation and the effects of degradation on productivity. Unlike GLASOD, it includes some information on conservation and rehabilitation (Oldeman and van\nLynden 1997: 432).\nAlthough an improvement over GLASOD, ASSOD is not without problems. The assessment of the degree, extent, and recent\npast rate of soil degradation is still based on expert opinion,\nand the scale (1:5 million) is still not adequate to guide national\nsoil improvement policies (Oldeman and van Lynden 1997: 438).\nOldeman and van Lynden recommend, as a next step, the preparation of national 1:1 million soil and terrain digital databases\nthat would support a more objective assessment of the status of\nsoils and the risk of human-induced soil degradation.\n\n**GRASSLAND SOIL CONDITION**\nHistorical records suggest evidence of large-scale soil degradation in many areas of the world over the past 5,000 years (Scherr\n1999:17). GLASOD was designed to provide estimates of the\nextent and severity of soil degradation for a shorter, more recent\ntime period: from 1945 to 1990. GLASOD divides soil degradation into four categories: water erosion, wind erosion, chemical\ndeterioration, and physical deterioration. For each category,\nGLASOD advisors estimated the proportional area affected by\ndegradation (extent) and the scale of degradation (degree).\nGLASOD concluded that approximately 23 percent of the world\u2019s\nused terrestrial area was degraded: 38 percent was lightly degraded; 46 percent moderately degraded; and 16 percent strongly\nto extremely degraded (Oldeman and van Lynden 1997: 430).\nTo determine the condition of grassland soils, PAGE analysts superimposed the GLASOD map of soil degradation severity over the map of PAGE grassland extent. The overlay of\n\n\nthese two maps, however, tends to overestimate the severity of\nsoil degradation in grasslands; GLASOD mapping units intersecting PAGE grassland extent are large and the assigned degradation severity class may not represent the entire area.",

More recently, the survey has expanded to include Alaska and northern Mexico. The\nsurvey is based on observations of breeding birds along more\nthan 3,500 survey routes, each approximately 40 kilometers in\nlength. (See the Breeding Bird Survey [BBS] Home Page at http:/\n/www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/.) Each spring, skilled volunteers\ntravel the routes, stopping every 0.8 km to record all birds seen\nor heard within a 0.4 km radius during a three-minute period.\nBy analyzing the number of individuals of each species detected\nper survey route, trends can be monitored over time for particular breeding ranges. BBS data also can be plotted spatially to\nshow species richness and population trends.\nThe Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has grouped breeding bird species into five breeding habitat groups: grassland,\nwetland-open water, successional-scrub, woodland, and urban\nspecies (Sauer et al. 1999). The grassland habitat group discussed here includes 28 species, such as the upland sandpiper,\nlong-billed curlew, greater prairie chicken, northern harrier,\nshort-eared owl, vesper sparrow, savannah sparrow, and dickcissel. These species have similar behavioral and ecological\ntraits and when data on their populations are combined, they\ncan indicate changes in the condition of grassland habitat.\nMaps of the density and population trends of these 28 species, across the United States and southern Canada, show some\nconsistent patterns (Map 17Map 17Map 17Map 17). The population distribution mapMap 17\nreflects data from 1982 through 1996; the population trend map\nreflects data from 1966 through 1995.

A valuable next step\nwould be a macroeconomic or general equilibrium modeling exercise to frame the uncertainty\nand range of potential impacts arising from future environmental trends with more precision.\n\nWe provided our results for the FMCG industry in aggregate rather than for individual companies, which vary significantly. For example, a company producing beverages may be exposed\nprimarily to inputs like sugar, coffee, water, and oil, whereas a personal care company may be\nmore exposed to electricity, oil, pulp, and palm oil.

Resource conservation strategies will be crucial to dealing with rising costs\nover the long term.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe question for the FMCG and other sectors is, how should they, either individually or collectively, address these trends in sustainability?

We believe that beginning a dialogue about the issues we outlined or others\nspecific to your organization will help you find a variety of ways of creating value for your\norganization, which will likely extend beyond managing the risk of rising commodity costs.\n\nIn this section, we offer a road map to begin addressing the issues in this report and to\nchart a sustainable path for business leaders.

National governments\nand their policies and legislation strongly influence\nwhether farmers invest in improved natural\nresource management in general and in trees in\nparticular. Governments are in a position to create\nenabling conditions that favor farmer innovations\nand regreening, or they can fail to address policy\nand institutional barriers and discourage its\nscaling up. Accordingly, mobilizing a concerted\neffort to understand the barriers to community\nparticipation in regreening, and to identify possible\nincentives that could be reinforced to accelerate the\nwidespread adoption of regreening practices, are\nespecially important.\n\nExperience with large-scale regreening successes\nsuggests that changes in farmer behavior and the\nwidespread adoption of farmer-managed natural\nregeneration and related practices can be triggered\nand accelerated by the following conditions:\n\nExposure to innovative farmers who have",

Analyze barriers to community participation in regreening and engage key stakeholders in adapting national policies, legislation, and other enabling conditions to induce farmers to invest in trees\n\nA critically important area for policy reform relates\nto land tenure and strengthening farmers\u2019 rights\nto manage trees and other resources. At a national\nworkshop in Burkina Faso in 2013, innovative\nfarmers examined the benefits of agroforestry and\nother sustainable land management practices and\ndiscussed strategies for scaling up the adoption of\nthese practices. They stressed the importance of\nsecure land tenure and clear rights to manage trees\non their farms. Farmers were concerned about\nthe risks of losing labor invested in protecting and\nregenerating trees, restoring soil fertility, and other\npractices aimed at increasing the productivity of\ntheir farms.\n\nWhile secure land tenure is important to farmers\nwho want to plant trees, it is not always important\nto farmers who want to protect and manage natural\nregeneration. The act of tree planting is regarded by\nfarmers as an appropriation of land. Farmers who\ndo not own the land they cultivate can protect and\nmanage natural regeneration, because they perceive\nthis to be different from planting trees.\n\nFarmers will invest in managing trees when they\nhave exclusive and legally confirmed rights to use\nand benefit from them. In some cases, perceptions\nabout ownership and rights can be as important as\nthe actual laws. For example, in Niger, following\nthe introduction of democracy and policy reforms\nlaunched in the 1990s to support decentralized\nnatural resource management, farmers acted on the\nperception that they had a right to manage the trees\non their farms, even though the Forest Code still\naffirmed that trees belonged to the state. Relatively\nunrestricted harvesting and marketing of products\nfrom trees in fields will allow farmers to develop\nagroforestry value chains. This is currently not the\ncase in many countries. Farmers often need permits\nfrom the forestry service to exploit on-farm trees\nthey have protected and managed. Ironically, had\nthey planted these trees, this requirement might not\napply. Obtaining a permit can be complex and timeconsuming. Farmers generally must pay for per\n\nmits and may need to negotiate with forest agents\nresponsible for issuing them.",

Train the next generation of extension and forestry agents and researchers to be agroforestry champions\n\nUntil a decade ago, farmer-managed natural\nregeneration in drylands was barely on the radar\nscreen of agroforestry researchers. It is there now,\nbut development professionals and researchers\nstill need training in agroforestry and education\nabout the role farmers can play in protecting and\nmanaging natural regeneration, on and off the\nfarm. This will most likely be a long process, but\nthere are some good starting points. The African\nNetwork for Agriculture, Agroforestry, and Natural\nResources Education has 137 member institutions\n(universities and colleges) in 35 African countries\nand could play an important role in strengthening\nagroforestry education.[20]\n\nIt is also possible to directly tap into the\nknowledge and experience of innovative farmers\n\n\n-----\n\nin agroforestry. Their fields can be used as training\ngrounds and sources of inspiration for both\ndevelopment practitioners and researchers.

Barthel\u00e9my\nDjambou, a farmer and agroforestry innovator in\nCameroon even built a classroom in his fields where\nhe gives training in agroforestry and other land\nmanagement practices to farmers from different\nparts of Cameroon and to agronomy students from\nthe University of Dschang. In addition, students\nfrom agricultural schools complete 2 to 3 months of\npractical training on his farm (Tchawa, Tchiagam,\nand Bonneau 2001, 27).

Although farmers in Niger have built new\nagroforestry parklands on 5 million hectares, many\npeople in Niger are not yet aware of this large-scale\ntransformation and regreening success.\n\nOne way to convey a positive message widely is\nthrough documentaries about successes for national\nand international TV channels. An example of a\nhigh-quality documentary suitable for television\nis More People, More Trees: Environmental\n_Recovery in Africa by William Critchley. It revisits_\nthe same field sites and interviews the same people\nin Burkina Faso and in Kenya almost 2 decades\napart. A powerful story about environmental\ntransformation and building more productive\nfarming systems, it has already aired on national TV\nin Burkina Faso.\n\nAnother powerful documentary is The Man Who\n_Stopped the Desert by Mark Dodd.[22] It tells the_\nstory of Yacouba Sawadogo, one of the most\ninnovative farmers in the West African Sahel.\nYacouba Sawadogo improved a traditional water\nharvesting technique that has now been used in\nBurkina Faso and Niger to rehabilitate tens of\nthousands of hectares of severely degraded land.\n\n\nThis documentary has been shown on national TV\nin France as well as in documentary film festivals in\n20 countries, where it has won seven awards.\n\nIn June 2012 a team from the U.S. Public\nBroadcasting System program NewsHour produced\na documentary about the famine in Niger.

If they were not, they would not invest in trees. Convincing national and international policymakers that it is economically rational to invest in regreening will require better economic data.\n\n Donors may prefer high-cost projects  and large investment portfolios\n\nSince regreening is fundamentally about motivating local investments in improving land and water\nmanagement, it does not necessarily require large\namounts of external financing. Strange as it sounds,\nthe relatively low cost of farmer-managed regreening may be a constraint to its expansion. Many\ngovernments and donor agencies seem interested\nin funding large infrastructure projects and other\ninterventions with relatively high costs. Conventional forestry projects often require investments of\n$1,000 per hectare or more. At this rate, the cost of\nreforesting 1 million hectares amounts to $1 billion\nor more.\n\nFarmers protecting and managing woody species on\ntheir farmland do not require investments in nurseries and funds to cover the transport of seedlings\nto planting sites.

This is often not the case. Many\nspecies have to be pruned to develop a trunk and\na canopy. This means they have to be pruned from\nyear 2 or 3, which creates early benefits to farmers\nin the form of fuel and fodder.\n\n\nThe Tigray region of Ethiopia has made vast efforts\nto promote natural regeneration of vegetation on\ndegraded plots of land. Until recently the policy was\nto protect natural regeneration but not to touch it.\nThis means that trees were not pruned to develop\na trunk and a canopy. The result has been the\nproliferation of bushes and not trees. Sustainable\nmanagement and periodic pruning and harvesting\nof regenerated vegetation have the potential to produce significantly more economic and environmental benefits than just leaving natural regeneration\nuntouched (See Figure 18).\n\nIn fact, there can be severe competition between\nclosely spaced Acacia etbaica trees; in these cases,\nthe lack of pruning along with heavy gall infestations can contribute to slow growth. Farmers have\nfound that heavy pruning enhances both growth\nrate and tree form (see Figure 19). Without thinning and pruning, the 15-year-old stands of Acacia\n_etbaica averaged only 2\u20133 meters in height.[29]_\n\n\nFigure 18 | \u0007Pruning of Faidherbia albida Trees in Ethiopia to Encourage Rapid Growth, 2010\u20132014",

The project was initiated late in\n2007 and has run into several stumbling\nblocks since that time.\n\nFor example, local communities have\nexpressed concern over their limited\nparticipation in the design and implementation of the project, the lack of clarity as\nto their rights to access the area targeted\nby the KFCP, and the plans for benefits\nsharing.[a] According to ongoing monitoring by NGOs, causes for these community\nconcerns are several, including a lack\nof trust in the governmental and nongovernmental institutions managing the\n\n\nproject (based largely on past experiences,\nincluding in relation to the creation of an\norangutan research station in a forest area\nthe community reserved for rituals and\ntraditional ceremonies). The uncertain\nlegal structure for REDD+ in Indonesia\ngenerally has also created challenges.[b]\n\nAn independent evaluation of the project\narea in 2011 found that \u201cconsiderable\nwork\u201d remained in order to adequately\nengage local communities, and that the\nproject had \u201crushed\u201d into an area where\ncommunities \u201care still adjusting to the\ntraumatic changes to their lives\u201d caused\nby the Ex-Mega Rice Project implemented in the 1990s.[c] The evaluation\nalso found that the uncertain legal status\nof the demonstration site, including the\n\u201ccarbon rights\u201d of communities and\n\n\ntheir rights to timber and nontimber\nforest products, had \u201cimplications for\nthe motivation of local communities and\nfor the protection and maintenance of\nplanted trees in particular.\u201d[d] In addition,\nthe evaluation found that the project has\nrun into unanticipated environmental\nchallenges. For example, seedlings in\nthe revegetation areas have repeatedly\nperished during the dry season as a\nresult of bush fires.\n\nThese challenges have jeopardized the\nproject\u2019s ability to meet its intended goal.\nKFCP is not the only project to face such\nchallenges. It clearly demonstrates, however, the need to recognize and address\nthe potential relationship between REDD+,\nlocal populations, and ecosystems.",

A\ngeneral feature of board constituencies is that the arrangement for each individual board seat is tailored to the needs\nand interests of the constituents, giving a platform to\nthose countries not present on the board (Table 2).\n\nThe GEF, which alongside the GCF is the other operating\nentity of the Financial mechanism of the UNFCCC and the\nParis Agreement, has a Council with 32 members. Developing countries have 16 seats on the board, developed\ncountries have 14 seats, and the economies in transition\nhave two seats. Most seats are based on multi-country\narrangements, which include a rotation of the board seats\namong constituent members, as well as a consultation and\ndebriefing mechanism for constituents. A special feature\nwithin the GEF context is the availability of a budget line,\nadministered by the secretary of the board, to support the\nlogistics of a semi-annual developing countries\u2019 constituency meeting.

This would reward countries with less GHG emission per capita than the average by reducing their IMT contribution to GCF, and it\nwould increase the IMT for countries who are above the average. This approach fits with the Paris objective to reduce GHG emissions and provides an incentive\nto reduce per capita GHG emissions. The reduction factor, which is used to calculate the GHG per capita adjustment rate averaged over a period of six years, has\nbeen set at 25 percent, which causes a moderate impact on the base share. It is proposed that over time the reduction factor should increase and arrive at 75\npercent or higher by 2050 in light of the Paris Agreement\u2019s ambition to move close to a zero-emissions global economy by 2050.\n\nThe formula would be as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n2.

The site, named the Senga-tera Ferd-Bet\nRedevelopment Project, covered a total area of about 89\nhectares, with the first phase tackling about 26 hectares\n(Bekele 2019). The redevelopment project\u2019s focus on\nroad network improvements and additional development\nwere expected to improve the urban fabric, with positive\nimpacts affecting the neighborhood, subcity, and Addis\nAbaba as a whole.\n\nIn 2008, a new mayor of Addis Ababa was elected, having\ncampaigned on the platform of improved participatory\nand transparent processes in the city\u2019s development\nplanning (Alemu 2019; Bekele 2019; Tesfaye 2019; Zeluel\n2018, 2019). One new practice put in place by the city\ncouncil under the new mayor\u2019s administration was that\nof prioritizing development projects in communities that\nask for them. Lideta was one such community, and local\nofficials held multiple discussions about development\nplans for the area. This included a total of 12 meetings\nwith the mayor and city manager, who set priorities\nfor green and open space and made decisions about\nresidents\u2019 choice of relocation areas while redevelopment\nconstruction was happening.

Records and data from the HMDA are irregularly maintained, however, so it is difficult to compare data over time.\nThe large jump in total receipts in 2017\u20132019 is attributed\nto the state government\u2019s formalizing layouts and buildings,\nwhich were plotted layouts or constructions without proper\npermissions (Chandra 2019).\n\nAlthough the ORRGC is not generating as much revenue\nas originally estimated, it is generating some revenue from\nSDCs and is self-sustaining in terms of operations and\nmanagement (O&M). Toll revenue (INR 3 billion/year),\nwhich is not an LVC mechanism in itself, goes mainly into\nO&M and payment of interest on loans. DDCs have the\nbest chance of turning LVC into an equity benefit for local\ncommunities.

But good progress in reducing deforestation and rapid growth in energy use have shifted\nthis balance so that emissions from land-use change\nand energy are roughly equal. This is leading to a\ngreater focus on the potential role of the energy sector in Brazil\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n_Bridging the Gap Between Energy and Climate_\n_Policies in Brazil: Policy Options to Reduce_\n_Energy-Related GHG Emissions assesses trends in_\nBrazil\u2019s energy sector and presents policy options\nfor emissions reductions, with the goal of informing\nthe national dialog on energy and climate change.\nThe authors assess the impacts of existing energy\nand climate policies, as well as opportunities for\nfurther efficiency gains and emissions reductions,\nparticularly in the post-2020 timeframe.\n\nEmissions from energy in Brazil have traditionally\nbeen low due to strong reliance on hydroelectricity.\nBut recently, even while renewable-sourced energy\ncontinues to grow, fossil-based energy has been\ngrowing much faster, leading to a strong upward\ntrend in emissions. The good news is that Brazil\n\n\ncan reverse this trend. With nearly half of Brazil\u2019s\nenergy emissions now coming from transportation,\nthe report finds that Brazil can make significant\nheadway by tapping its vast renewable energy\npotential, modernizing its vehicles, and\nencouraging mass electrification and hybridization\nof its transportation fleet. Such efforts would\nnot only make a major contribution to Brazil\u2019s\nmitigation efforts, they would also deliver health\nco-benefits to its citizens and increase the livability\nand competitiveness of its cities.\n\nRecent research from many countries around\nthe world has shown that a bold shift toward a\nlow-carbon economy need not involve large\nincremental costs. On the contrary, done right, it\ncan lead to accelerated technological change, more\njobs, a better quality of life, and faster economic\ngrowth. Brazil can position itself as a leader in this\nhistoric transformation.\n\n**Andrew Steer**\n_President_\n_World Resources Institute_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",

It\nwould be important for the federal government to\ninvest in more actions to maximize the use of the\navailable capacity of transportation modes, and in\nmore efficient modes (ANTT, 2014).\n\nEncouraging modal shift and promoting multimodal transportation systems in Brazil would\nreduce the high reliance on road transport and lead\nto better integrated planning, especially in terms of\nland use in urban centers. In pursuit of these goals,\nfreight transport vehicles need to be larger, carry a\nbigger load, and operate more quickly. Ports must\nbe prepared for such demands via land and water,\nand this requires significant government effort.\n\nAs for the high costs of infrastructure, financial\nresources have not been sufficient to plan and\nimplement a national system of integrated surface\ntransport. Governments have been struggling to\nbalance investments in transportation with other\npressing needs (eliminating poverty, improving\nhealth conditions, and combating hunger, among\nothers). However, it is possible to achieve substantial improvements in all modes and in their integration, even with existing resources. Federal plans,\nespecially the National Mobility Plan (Plan-Mob)\ndo not currently provide strong support for shifting\ntransportation modes (for example, road to rail),\nand a greater integration between transport regulatory agencies could help with establishing measures\nto integrate modal transportation systems.",

The LIB chemistries commonly used in EVs include lithium iron phosphate (LFP or\nLiFePO4), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA or Li (NixCoyAlz)O2), and lithium nickel\nmanganese cobalt oxide (NMC or Li (Ni, Mn, Co) O2).

A careful analysis\nof recent fire incidents suggests that overcharging and self-ignition due to short circuit were two of the\nmost common causes. Some accidents also occurred as the battery management system (BMS) failed to\ndetect abnormalities at the cell or pack level. The following are the broad categories of such technical\nfaults in EV batteries:\n\n**A. Internal Short Circuit: This could happen due to a manufacturing defect in the cell (such as burrs**\nor metal lump, misalignment of electrodes, or punctured separators). LIB operation under abnormal\nconditions, such as overcharging or lower-temperature charging, can lead to lithium dendrite growth\nor lithium plating (deposition of extra lithium ions on the anode while charging). Poor battery\npack design, mechanical deformation during transportation, and a sudden increase in operating\ntemperature can also lead to internal short circuits.\n\n**B. External Short Circuit: This can be caused by exposure to an external fire or loose connections**\nwhile assembling the batteries during manufacturing. Severe mechanical deformation, water\nimmersion, corrosion, and electric shock can also trigger an external short circuit.\n\n**C. Overcharging and Overdischarging: The major reasons for thermal runaway due to charging or**\ndischarging could be overcharging of the battery pack, high current, operation at a higher C-rate\n(the rate at which battery is providing energy), and discharge below the minimum voltage levels.\n\n**D. Exposure to High Temperature: Most lithium-ion battery chemistries demonstrate low**\nthermal stability at high temperatures. Therefore, considering space and other constraints,",

Manufacturing faults, such as a loose electrical connection,\ncan also cause a sudden temperature rise. Extreme ambient temperature due to increased\nself-heating is another leading cause of fire in EVs.\n\n**E. Mechanical Deformation and Impact: Mechanical deformation or cell punctures can occur**\nduring transportation and movement of batteries. It can also be caused by faulty cells or crashing\nof cells due to collision during transportation.\n\nSome of the other reasons for recent EV battery fires are as follows:\n\nl **Quality Concerns: To reduce the total cost of EVs, some manufacturers are importing low-quality**\ncells for the battery pack.\n\nl **Design Concerns: Design Concerns: Poor battery pack design and lack of suitable batteries and**\nTMSs in battery packs, especially in electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws) and three-wheelers (e-3Ws)\n\nwhich dominate the Indian\n\nl **EV market.Lack of Knowledge and Skills: Most consumers and service providers lack the**\nknowledge to maintain and service electric vehicle components, including critical components such\n\nas batteries and BMSs.\n\nl **Extreme Operational Conditions: Variations in ambient temperate due to varying climatic zones**\nand road conditions in India can also lead to fire incidents.\n\nLow-quality cells, low-efficiency BMSs, and inadequate protection against overcharging have emerged\nas the major reasons for the recent fire incidents. It is crucial to develop a framework to understand\nthe safety readiness of the current battery technologies available in the market and design solutions\nto minimize fire hazards. Understanding the root causes of such incidents can help manufacturers\nimplement preventive measures to minimize risks.

This second risk is due to\nthe influence of international emissions trading: for instance, country A\u2019s\nexcess emission allowances (due to weak targets) might be traded to country B, which would, as a consequence, be able to increase its own emissions. (This phenomenon is often referred to as \u201chot air\u201d trading.)\nAt least three ways of designing emission targets could potentially reduce economic uncertainties and environmental risks. The first is a dy_namic target. Under this kind of target, a country\u2019s allowable level of emis-_\nsions is adjusted according to some other variable, such as gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) (CCAP 1998, Baumert et al. 1999, Philibert and Pershing\n2001). A dynamic target of this sort was proposed by Argentina in 1999\n(Chapter 6). Dynamic targets can reduce economic uncertainty in the\ntarget-setting process and promote environmental integrity (i.e., less unintentional \u201chot air\u201d), particularly with respect to developing countries.\nYet, dynamic targets pose certain challenges relative to fixed targets, including added complexity and data requirements. These challenges are\nexplored in greater depth in Chapter 5.\nA second way to design emission targets is to use dual targets. Here, a\ncountry has two emission targets, rather than one. The purpose of the\nlower (more stringent) target is to provide an incentive to reduce emissions, since reductions below this target would enable the country to sell\nemission reduction allowances. The higher (less stringent) target would\nhave a punitive function: Exceeding this target puts the country out of\ncompliance. Thus, the lower target would be a selling target and the higher\none a compliance target. No penalty would be assessed if emissions fell\nbetween the selling and the compliance targets. That area would be the\nsafe zone, in which the country is neither out of compliance nor able to\nsell allowances through international emissions trading. This dual target\nconcept, as explored in Chapter 5, could be combined with a dynamic\ntarget approach.",

They\nbuild on similar, less extensive obligations under the Convention, which\nrequire Annex I Parties to submit GHG emissions data on an annual basis, as well as regular national reports on their climate policies. The annual emissions data and regular national reports are subject to review by\nindependent \u201cexpert review teams\u201d with the power to raise any potential\ncompliance problems with the Protocol\u2019s Compliance Committee. A complex accounting procedure,[16] including registry systems at both the national and international levels, will also record transactions in emission\ncredits and allowances. The right of Annex I Parties to fully participate in\nthe three flexibility mechanisms depends on their compliance with these\naccountability mechanisms.\nA Compliance Committee[17] will review cases of suspected non-compliance and, if non-compliance is proven, impose penalties through its enforcement branch.

To help developing countries adapt to climate change, a levy will\nbe imposed on CDM transactions and the proceeds channeled to a newly\ncreated adaptation fund, which operates under the Kyoto Protocol.[18] Two\nother new funds were also set up under the Convention: a special climate\n_change fund will finance a variety of adaptation and mitigation projects,_\nincluding economic diversification for countries heavily dependent on fossil\nfuel income, while a _least developed countries fund will finance national_\nadaptation programs of action in least developed countries.[19] Several industrialized countries[20] have already pledged to donate $410 million a year\nin new money to these funds by 2005.",

These concerns suggest\nthe need for separate rules on the inclusion of the land use, land-use change,\nand forestry sector in developing-country emission caps or, alternatively, a\nrequirement for countries to demonstrate the existence of sound monitoring and high quality data before this sector can be included.\n\n**Accounting, reporting and review**\nA new system of developing-country emission caps could draw on the Kyoto\nProtocol\u2019s existing accounting, reporting, and review architecture. However, given that non-Annex I Parties are generally at an earlier stage in\nthe development of their emissions estimation and monitoring systems, a\nsignificant capacity-building effort would be needed to enable many of\nthem to comply with the highly detailed accounting and reporting obligations currently set forth for Annex I Parties. One option would be to draft\nless demanding guidelines for non-Annex I Parties under the Protocol,\njust as there are separate reporting guidelines for these Parties under the\nConvention. Alternatively, non-Annex I Parties could use the same accounting and reporting guidelines as Annex I Parties, but with some flexibility in their application; the implementation of these guidelines could\nthen be introduced gradually among non-Annex I Parties, depending on\ntheir capacities. The aim must be to ensure the maximum possible rigor,\nin order to maintain confidence in emissions data and therefore in the\nvalidity of emission reductions.\n\n**Compliance**\nA related issue concerns the compliance regime under the Kyoto Protocol. Developing countries may call for special consideration by the Compliance Committee in the event of suspected non-compliance; the compliance procedures already make reference to the principle of \u201ccommon\nbut differentiated responsibilities.\u201d It is possible to envisage a sliding scale\nof such special consideration. At one end of the scale, developing countries could be offered extra assistance from the facilitative branch to help\nimprove emissions data quality or if the early warning system identifies\npotential compliance problems, but no other special consideration in the\nevent of actual non-compliance.",

Annex I Parties themselves built up experience with legally non-binding pledges in the late 1980s and a soft target\nunder the Convention before they moved on to legally binding caps under\nthe Protocol. A system of voluntary emission caps may be more acceptable to developing countries at this stage, especially given the uncertainty\nin their emissions data and projections. As discussed in Chapter 1, the\nterm \u201cvoluntary\u201d is an ambiguous one, with all commitments in the climate change regime being fundamentally voluntary, in that a sovereign\nstate cannot be forced to sign on to them, and can withdraw its adherence.\nIn this case, however, the assumption is that voluntary pledges would be\nmade that would not be considered as binding obligations and, importantly, would not be subject to penalties under the Compliance Committee\u2019s\nenforcement branch. This would have implications, however, for the extent to which developing countries could participate in the flexibility\nmechanisms; legally binding emission caps are widely seen as fundamental\nto the emissions trading regime under the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n**Flexibility mechanisms**\nWhether and how to integrate non-Annex I Parties into the emissions\ntrading regime, even if they do take on legally binding emission caps, raises\nmany issues. On the one hand, a primary incentive for non-Annex I Parties to join an emission control system is to participate in emissions trading. On the other hand, their full participation has the potential for generating \u201ctropical hot air.\u201d If a large number of non-Annex I Parties, or just\na few large emitters, enter the emissions trading market with lenient targets\u2014and therefore a ready surplus to sell\u2014this could lead to a flood of\ncheap emission credits that could remove any incentive for real climate\nchange mitigation measures among the remainder of the Parties. A related problem surrounds the generally poorer quality emissions data in\nmost non-Annex I Parties, which opens up the possibility that fictitious\nemission credits might be sold.",

Although it would\nnot solve the potential problem of overly lenient targets, extending the\ncurrent eligibility requirements for participating in emissions trading to\nnon-Annex I Parties would mean that they had to meet the existing rigorous accounting and reporting obligations of Annex I Parties before being\nable to sell emission credits, thus helping to ensure the validity of these\ncredits. Extending eligibility requirements in this way would serve as a\nclear incentive for non-Annex I Parties to improve their data collection\nand monitoring systems, although additional financial resources and capacity-building initiatives would be needed to help them make such improvements. Non-Annex I Parties unable to comply with the eligibility\ncriteria for emissions trading might still be able to participate in joint\nimplementation, which has its own supervisory committee for host countries not fully meeting accounting and reporting obligations. Under such a\nscenario, non-Annex I Parties with emission targets would no longer participate as hosts in the CDM, which would be reserved for any countries\nexempt from the emission target system.\nThese are just examples of what could happen. Exactly how non-Annex I Parties with emission targets would be treated under the three mechanisms would be open to negotiation. While such negotiations would undoubtedly seek to minimize the potential for tropical hot air and fictitious\ncredits, the political reality is that the availability of a certain number of\ncheap emission credits from developing countries may be necessary both\nto induce Annex I Parties to commit themselves to deeper emission cuts,\nand to persuade the United States to re-enter the Kyoto regime. Agreeing\nto the levels of non-Annex I emission targets, and any additional rules for\nthe flexibility mechanisms, so as to fulfill the triple aims of cost-effectiveness, environmental integrity, and attracting both Annex I and non-Annex I Parties into the system, promises to be a difficult balancing act.\n\n**_Advantages_**\n\n**Familiarity**\n\u201cContinuing Kyoto\u201d by extending individual caps on absolute emissions\nto non-Annex I Parties has several advantages.

Emissions from the industrialized North\nhave thus far been greater than from the developing South, but they are\ngrowing rapidly in the latter.[1] The principle of \u201ccommon, but differentiated responsibilities\u201d between industrialized and developing countries is\nwell established in the negotiations. However, cooperation between North\nand South has been limited in the negotiations under the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change\nis not seen as a priority by developing countries, which are preoccupied by\nthe challenges of meeting basic development needs. As the commitment\nperiod beyond the Kyoto targets (2008\u201312) draws closer, the question of\nhow developing countries might participate in the effort against global\nwarming becomes more urgent.\nParticipation could take different forms. Participation might range from\nmandatory requirements, such as quantified emission limitation targets,\nto pledges to make their development path more sustainable. Dividing a\nglobal reduction target among all countries (in a \u201ctop-down\u201d manner) is\nonly one possible approach (see Chapter 1).[2] The alternative approach is\npledge-based (in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d matter). The pledge could be to quantified emission targets, as in the Kyoto process,[3] or more qualitative in nature. In such an approach, it is clear that countries negotiate in their selfinterest, so each tends to propose indicators most beneficial to itself (Grubb",

Such indicators have many uses; within the environmental sector,\nper capita indicators have been applied to the management of natural\nresources, such as freshwater and energy.\nWithin the climate regime, per capita indicators are used in various\nways. First and most generally, per capita indicators help evaluate emissions disparities among countries. For example, the 2001 Marrakesh Accords state that industrialized countries \u201cshall implement domestic\naction\u2026with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country\nParties\u201d (UNFCCC 2002). Second, per capita indicators are often used in\npolicy debates relating to the timing of commitments to be taken by countries. For example, a per capita emissions indicator could be used to define\na threshold for initiating developing-country participation into an emission control regime (much like the Montreal Protocol\u2019s staggered commitments for controlling ozone-depleting substances). Third, per capita\nemissions (and per capita GDP) are often proposed as an indicator for\ndifferentiating emission commitments between countries (Table 8.1).

The inevitability of\ndeveloping countries coming into the emissions control regime at some\nstage and the need for an acceptable strategy for global participation fueled support for and further development of this concept. This includes\nsupport within governments. The Indian government was one of the first\nto officially adopt the equal per capita entitlements approach; at the First\nConference of the Parties to the Climate Convention (COP 1) in 1995,\nthe Indian government called for \u201cimplementing a program for convergence and sustainable par values for consumption on a per capita basis\u201d\n(GCI 1999).

Assumptions and Methodology\n\nThe environmental goal at the center of this analysis is stabilization of\natmospheric CO2 concentration between 450 and 550 parts per million by\nvolume (ppmv) by 2100. This long-term target range corresponds to the\nlowest CO2 concentration targets adopted in the emission mitigation scenarios examined in the latest IPCC report (IPCC 2001c). This represents,\nat most, a doubling of CO2 atmospheric concentrations compared to preindustrial levels. Stabilization at such a level could still entail potentially\nserious damages attributable to climatic changes.\nConsistent with a 450 to 550 ppmv CO2 stabilization goal, an intermediary goal is set at 9.4 billion tons of carbon equivalent (GtC) for 2030.\nThis constitutes the maximum level of annual world CO2 emissions. The\nreason for this intermediary target stems from the trajectories for CO2\nemissions from fossil fuel combustion drawn in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, from 1990 onward (IPCC 2001c). To achieve concentration\nstabilization between 450 and 550 ppmv, most of the fossil fuel CO2 mitigation scenarios reviewed by the IPCC show similar inverted U-shaped\nemission trajectories. The inverted U-shaped emission trajectories mean\nthat, after a period of growth, emissions reach a maximum between 2020\nand 2060, stabilize for a time, and finally decline at a different rate (IPCC\n2001c, 130, 150). The maximum emission level ranges from 6 to 15 GtC\nper year in the IPCC review. The maximum emission level of 9.4 GtC in\n2030 is in the lower range of these trajectories.\nThis analysis uses the POLES model, a partial equilibrium model of the\nenergy sector, and the ASPEN software.[2] Thus, only CO2 emissions from\nfossil fuel combustion are taken into account.[3] Countries are considered\neither individually or on a regionally aggregated basis. The assumptions\nfor 2010 emissions are designed to reflect current conditions (Box 9.1),\nwith global emissions reaching approximately 7.8 GtC in 2010. Between\n2010 and 2030, CO2 emissions increase from 7.8 GtC to nearly 12 GtC.",

This would amount\nto a 34 percent improvement in emissions intensity from BAU levels for\nAnnex I countries, and almost 10 percent for non-Annex I countries by\n2030.\nImproving emissions intensities by 2 percent yearly relative to their BAU\nlevels would imply an approximate 3 percent annual reduction in carbon\nintensity for most Annex I countries. Intensity changes required to meet\nthe targets in non-Annex I countries would vary more widely, ranging\nfrom a 0.5 percent annual intensity increase to a 2 percent decrease. Still,\non average, most countries would have to reduce their emissions intensity\nby around 1 percent annually.\nThe emission allowances for each country based on this scenario are\noutlined in Table 9.3. As in the Relative Responsibility scenario, all countries would have to reduce their emissions compared with their BAU levels by 2030.

Comparative Assessment\n\nAlthough the 2030 global emission budget remains unchanged (9.4 GtC),\nthe three scenarios yield different distributions of emission allowances\nbetween Annex I and non-Annex I countries (Table 9.4). Namely, Annex I countries would be allocated one quarter of the total global emission\nbudget under the Per Capita Convergence scenario, whereas they would\nreceive approximately one third of all allowances under the other two\nscenarios. Given the assumptions adopted for each scenario, in all cases\nAnnex I countries need to achieve a greater reduction in their emissions\nthan non-Annex I countries.\nAs a result of deeper emission reductions in Annex I countries, and\ndespite faster population growth in non-Annex I countries, the 2030 per\ncapita CO2 allowance for Annex I countries would diminish in all scenarios relative to 1990, while that of non-Annex I countries would increase (Table 9.5). For example, the European Union\u2019s per capita allowance would be about 1.6 to 1.7 tC in any of the scenarios, whereas it was\n2.4 tC in 1990 and would be 2.8 tC in the BAU case by 2030.

A menu of multiple options might comprise\nvarious items and choices through which countries could exercise their\npolitical will. A single option (e.g., fixed targets) might be too limiting\nand, consequently, the flexibility of multiple options might mobilize maximum emission reductions.\nSecond, a system featuring multiple options may enable Parties to gain\nexperience, capacity, and added confidence to support greater long-term\naction on climate change. It might take 100 or more years to achieve the\nClimate Convention\u2019s ultimate objective of preventing dangerous climate\nchange.

This scenario also incorporated binding state-level\nactions such as Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) tar\u00ad\ngets and announced zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) targets\nas of September 2020. Finally, the RS accounts for federal\npolicies such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)\nstandards for light-duty vehicles and the Obama admin\u00ad\nistration\u2019s amended New Source Performance Standards\nmethane regulations.\n\nScenarios 1\u20133 built on the RS by incorporating additional\nmeasures directed toward scaling up deployment of exist\u00ad\ning cost-effective technologies over the next decade and\nencouraging innovation of emerging clean energy tech\u00ad\nnologies needed in later decades. Further details about\nthe selection and combination of policy measures across\nthe three policy scenarios and the RS are discussed in\nSection 3; underlying assumptions and data sources used\nto develop these scenarios are presented in the Technical\nAppendices.\n\nThe evolution of U.S. energy demand and supply and\nemissions reductions under these scenarios from 2018\nthrough 2050 were assessed using E3\u2019s PATHWAYS and\nRESOLVE models (Figure 1). These models utilize inputs\nsuch as projections of fuel prices, cost and performancerelated characteristics of energy infrastructure, and\nequipment sales to forecast annual energy demand, emis\u00ad\nsions by fuel type, stocks and sales of energy-consuming\ndevices, and electricity supply infrastructure for each\nsimulated year.\n\nFurther details on PATHWAYS and RESOLVE, model\u00ad\ning assumptions, inputs, and outputs are provided in the\nTechnical Appendices.",

Conducting or revising an LCA for a specific city can be too time\nintensive and costly to be comfortably feasible in the context of an RFP, tender, or program reporting period,\nespecially when operators work with external LCA consultants. Additionally, some RFP or tender processes\nprohibit dialogue between the city and operators; therefore, even if an operator has LCAs for multiple\ngeographies, the operator must determine which is the most appropriate proxy. As a result, a city may\nreceive LCAs that refer to a range of geographies. To what extent can these be directly compared and how?\n\nThe geographic location of a shared micromobility service would primarily impact emissions related\nto electricity use, transportation of manufactured components, and distance traveled by auxiliary\nvehicles. As noted above, the largest share of emissions usually derives from raw materials extraction\nand manufacturing, followed by the type and distance of auxiliary vehicles. The main overlap between\nhigh-emitting life cycle stages and city-specific elements is the distance traveled by auxiliary vehicles. If\npossible, then, a proxy city should have auxiliary vehicle mileage similar to the city of interest. Moreover,\nsince the location where the shared micromobility service operates does not impact many of the highestemitting life cycle stages, comparing LCAs from different cities may be appropriate. Cities concerned about\nthis aspect of comparability could focus on comparing the production stage of LCAs and possibly the endof-life stage.",

This guide is applicable to any of these systems, and LCAs for docked, dockless, and\nhybrid shared micromobility services can be compared directly. Compared to a dockless system, there are\ntwo main differences to account for when estimating emissions from a docked or hybrid system. The most\nimportant is the dock infrastructure itself. LCAs should include the production, maintenance, electricity\nuse, and end-of-life of docks (see B4 and B5 in Figure 3). Second, some docks charge e-bikes, reducing or\neliminating the need to transport e-bikes to a charging facility. This difference would be accounted for in the\nelectricity use of the dock and the mileage of auxiliary vehicles.\n\nThere may be other differences in miles traveled by auxiliary vehicles to service docked versus dockless\nsystems. Dockless systems, for example, may entail more vehicle travel to rebalance micromobility vehicles\nor distribute them after charging, since it is typical to place a smaller number of vehicles in many locations.\nIn addition, some docked systems reduce the need for rebalancing by incentivizing users to return vehicles\nto docks in less popular locations. These differences, however, do not necessitate any change in method,\nespecially since other factors like urban form can also impact miles traveled by auxiliary vehicles. LCAs\nshould just include the best available data on the mileage of the auxiliary vehicle fleet.\n\nThe same applies to micromobility vehicles with embedded versus swappable batteries. No change in LCA\nmethod is required. The established method and life cycle stages would adequately capture differences in\nbattery production and lifespan, miles traveled by auxiliary vehicle, and other differences.",

These acts, and\n\nthe relative impunity with which they have been carried out, have\n\nheightened tensions and sparked further conflict (HRW, 1996).\n\nThe involvement of the military in logging makes forest\n\nproblems particularly intractable for two reasons. First, because of\n\nthe military\u2019s overwhelming coercive power, it can flout environ\nmental regulations with impunity. Second, in some countries, the\n\nmilitary\u2019s anti-insurgency and self-financing objectives converge,\n\nleading to both unsustainable logging and human rights viola\n\n-----\n\ntary and logging interests were advanced in the context of offensives\n\nagainst the rebel NPA (HRW, 1996). There is similar evidence\n\nfrom Burma (Box 2).\n\nIn Laos, the military has not been accused of human rights\n\nviolations, but is categorically implicated in illegal logging. In 1992,\n\nthe government attempted to control logging, which had expanded\n\nrapidly to feed a Thai-financed boom in sawmill capacity, by im\nposing a series of provincial quotas. But central government was\n\nunable to enforce these quotas, and above-quota logging and\n\nsawnwood exports continued. In October 1994, the government\n\nrevoked concessions throughout Laos, withdrew the right of saw\nmills to cut their own wood, and transferred logging rights to three\n\nmilitary-run corporations (Walker, 1996). Today, illegal logging by\n\nthe military accounts for production figures far in excess of the\n\nannual allowable cut of 275,000 m[3]. An analysis by ITTO shows\n\nsawnwood exports of 170,000 m[3]. Since three units of timber are\n\nneeded to produced one unit of sawnwood, and Laos imports no\n\n\ntimber production. According to the government, half of this gap\n\nis accounted for by illegal logging, often in areas slated to be flooded\n\nby hydropower projects (GOL, 1998). But very few of these\n\nprojects are financially viable. The real reason for such large-scale\n\nlogging is not legitimate salvage, but the need for the military,\n\nwhich receives little government financial support, to pay for itself.",

The level of taxation in the region is generally\n\nlow, meaning that concessionaires capture a large share of the po\ntential value of the forest. Low taxes also encourage bad manage\nment because an undervalued raw material reduces the incentive to\n\ninvest in better harvesting, and because the concessionaire will be\n\nin a hurry to extract as much timber a possible before the present\n\nfavorable taxation system changes. The introduction of a signifi\ncantly higher area tax is a key component of many forest taxation\n\nreforms. Area taxes are recognized as an instrument to increase\n\nrevenue collection (because they are easy to collect) and as a regula\ntory tool (because they act as a disincentive to companies that want\n\nto acquire huge concessions for speculative purposes).\n\nArea taxes are particularly powerful when coupled with\n\nan auction system because they force companies to reveal how\n\nmuch they consider the forest to be worth. This is particularly\n\nimportant in Southeast Asia because the companies usually have\n\nmuch better data on the commercial value of the forest than does\n\nthe state. Under these conditions, an area tax-based auction system\n\nserves as a disclosure mechanism. Cameroon was one of the first\n\ncountries to allocate concessions by auction. The results of the first\n\nround of auctions held in November 1997 showed a high willing\nness to pay by the industry, with many companies offering 3-4\n\ntimes the minimum required bid of $2 per hectare per year.

Given that subsurface\ndrainage has become more prevalent in many areas since 1992,\nthe NRI data are likely to underestimate the present extent of tile\ndrains. However, neither set of estimates was consistently higher\nthan the other at the state or county level, making it difficult to\ndiscern any trend in the data. In some areas, the NRI analysis\npredicted greater drained acreage than the SDC estimates at\nboth the county and the aggregated state levels. One reason for\nthis could be the existence of subsurface drainage in lands with\nmoderately well-drained soils, which would have been captured\nin the NRI survey but were not by the SDC method due to the\nmap-based criteria used. In other cases, experts indicated that the\nSDC estimates were too high. Thus, it was unclear which set of\nestimates would be more accurate for a given county.\n\nReconciling the NRI and GIS Estimates\nTo address this uncertainty in creating a single best-guess set\nof estimates, the NRI and SDC data sets were reconciled and\ncompiled by incorporating existing state-level data. The NRI was\nused as the default estimate for most counties because the SDC\nmethod did not include all states.\n\nStates for which there were SDC estimates and a very high\npercentage of subsurface-drained cropland out of total drained\ncropland (80% or higher) according to Farm Drainage were\ntreated individually. The states selected were Ohio, Illinois,\nIndiana, Michigan, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Developed\n\ncountry governments, however, project that they will\n\ndeliver the $100 billion in 2023 (Figure 77), and that their\n\nclimate finance mobilization for developing countries\n\nwill average $100 billion per year over the period 2021\u201325\n\n(Canada and Germany 2021). This requires governments\n\nto continue to scale up their climate finance in line\n\nwith their pledges, yet there are concerning signs that\n\nsome developed countries are cutting their interna\ntional climate finance budgets, using global economic\n\nconditions and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as justifica\ntions (Lo 2022).\n\nPhasing out public financing for fossil fuels can reduce\n\na major driver of the climate crisis while freeing up\n\nfunding for greater investment in climate solutions such\n\nas clean energy. The IPCC finds that removing fossil\n\nfuel subsidies could reduce global emissions between\n\n1 percent and 10 percent by 2030 while improving public\n\nrevenues (IPCC 2022b). After falling to a record low in\n\n2020 due to the drop in oil prices caused by the pan\ndemic, the rebound in fossil fuel consumption subsidies\n\nin 2021 showed the limits of subsidy reform efforts, and\n\nthat they are still largely driven by global oil prices,\n\nwhich rose as some countries began to emerge from\n\npandemic shutdowns (IEA 2022e). Figure 78 shows the\n\ndifferent sources of public fossil fuel financing. While\n\n2022 data are not yet available, the impact of Russia\u2019s\n\ninvasion of Ukraine has caused global oil prices to\n\nincrease even further, which has resulted in even greater\n\nspending on fossil fuel consumption subsidies.\n\n\n**FIGURE 77 | \u0007Annual reported climate finance (2013\u201320) and projections (2021\u201325) toward the**",

A company may be taking some of\nthese steps already, so an important factor to\nconsider is whether the company has fully\nexplored and identified the broad business\nrisks and opportunities related to climate\nchange and policy actions.\n\n- **Create (or tap into existing) coordinated**\n**internal discussions. Most companies have**\none or more teams responsible for tracking\nand influencing policy, whether directly or\nindirectly through broader trade groups.\nMost companies also have internal teams\nresponsible for tracking environmental\nissues and performance. The stakeholder\ninterviews suggest more internal coordination is needed among these teams.\nSimilarly, many companies noted that\nit would be useful to engage senior leaders\n(executive or board-level champions) to lend\nlegitimacy and importance to this coordination. A simple action would be to have a\nsenior leader organize a discussion (a call\nor meeting) between the corporate sustainability director, the government relations\ndirector, and other relevant players (business units, investor relations, public affairs,\nmarketing). The goals for the discussion(s):\nshare perspectives and priorities, and\nultimately outline what the company is or\ncould be doing to engage in climate policy.\n\n- **Undertake a stakeholder review. In order**\nto fully engage in the wide and varied policy\nlandscape, companies need to understand\nthe diversity of stakeholders relevant to this\npolicy space. Companies can therefore undertake a review which maps all the various\nstakeholders they need to be tuned into and\nwith who they need to communicate. This\nprocess will also inform the transparency\nprocess detailed in section 3.2.\n\n\u2751\u2751 **Solicit external input. Numerous**\ncompanies noted the importance of\ninvolving external perspectives in that\ndiscussion. Outside thought leaders from\ncivil society, or even other sectors, can\nprovide a critical view and help identify\nadditional aspects of climate policy that\nmay be material to a company. They can\nalso lend legitimacy and credibility to the\ncompany\u2019s approach, as well as provide\nvaluable channels to influence various",

This\napproach uses signals from the grid operator to delay\ncharging, vary charger power consumption depending\non need, and turns the charger on and off to avoid\ngrid overload and manage grid congestion (CAISO\n2014). For example, for a typical EV owner who\u2019s\ncar is plugged in from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., charging\nwould only actually occur between 12 a.m. to 4 a.m.,\navoiding evening peaks in demand that commonly\noccur between 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n\n_Vehicle-to-grid charging (V2G) technology_\nincorporates all the benefits of V1G and allows\nthe vehicle to strategically send back (discharge)\nelectricity to the grid. Energy from the vehicle\nbattery is sent out through the charging equipment\nand beyond the electrical meter to the grid for\nfurther use (Cross 2020). Utility systems purchase\nthis excess energy from EV operators as needed and\nagreed upon (Salda\u00f1a et al. 2019). To enable V2G,\nthe vehicle and charger must be equipped with the\nnecessary hardware and software.",

For example,\nan EV owner might charge their car during a lowcost window, such as 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Upon driving\nto work the next day, they plug in the vehicle. With\nmore than enough charge in their vehicle, the owner\nhas the option to sell some of their \u201cexcess\u201d electricity\nback to the utility during a high-demand, high-cost\nwindow, such as 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. In this case, the EV\nowner benefits monetarily and the utility benefits\nfrom additional grid capacity without having to bring\nonline extra, more costly power generation plants, a\nwin-win situation.\n\nThe scenarios described above are technically feasible.\nOn average, EVs are only driven for 4 percent of a\nday and need to be actively charging for 10 percent.\nTherefore, there is ample time for flexible charging\nhours to avoid the negative consequences of electric\nvehicle expansion (Langton and Crisostomo 2014).\n\n\nVGI offers four main benefits to consumers, electric\nutilities, and the energy grid.",
        "31141f59-7e76-42f7-a5f3-8573456b3a88": "VGI offers four main benefits to consumers, electric\nutilities, and the energy grid.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. _Grid stability: According to the Sustainable_\nDevelopment Scenario,[11] the contribution\nof EV charging to peak demand hours of\nelectricity could be reduced by half with V1G\ncharging (IEA 2020).\n\n2. _Avoids or delays costly infrastructure upgrades: VGI_\nallows for gradual and sustained energy usage\nrather than investing in the maximum energy\nscenarios. For fleet managers and utilities, smart\ncharging may help avoid, or at least defer, the need\nfor costly upgrades. For example, to accommodate\nthe increased demand on the grid brought\nabout by their decision to electrify their Central\nLondon delivery fleet in 2013, the United Parcel\nService (UPS) purchased an upgraded electrical\nconnection from their utility company. But having\nswitched to smart charging in 2018, UPS found\nthat it had overestimated the costs needed to\nupgrade the grid distribution network. Managed\ncharging had avoided the need for such costly\ninvestments (Werthmann and Hutchinson 2021).\n\n3. _Supports the use and integration of renewable_\n_energy: Solar and wind, two significant sources of_\nrenewable energy, are intermittent energy sources;\nthey vary by season, time of day, and location.\nIntermittency issues are among the major barriers\nto increased use of renewable energy (Kline 2018).\nSmart charging can help to better align charging\nwith when renewable energy is being generated\n(Werthmann and Hutchinson 2021). For example,\nwith V1G, an owner\u2019s EV battery can absorb the\nsolar and wind energy generated at times of \u201cpeak\nproduction,\u201d when solar and wind are supplying\nlarger quantities of energy and then make that\nenergy available later when the resources are\nunavailable. With V2G, the EV battery can store\nsolar and wind energy during peak production\nand then transfer that energy to other consumers.\nThis helps resolve the intermittency issue and\nintegrates renewable sources into the grid with\nthe goal of making the grid as clean and energy\nefficient as possible (Davar 2020).",

Attaining these multiple development goals means that policymakers and civil society groups need\nto access information and analysis on the numerous interconnections\namong environmental resources, human well-being, and economic\nexpansion. The maps and analyses presented in this atlas are a first\nattempt to provide such information.\n\nThis information can be used in developing poverty reduction\n\nprograms and in designing policies for water resources management, agriculture production, biodiversity preservation, and charcoal\nproduction, among others. The maps and analyses presented here\nwill not provide easy answers to questions concerning the causes of\npoverty in Kenya and how ecosystems can best be managed to increase\neconomic growth and improve livelihoods. But they are a first step\ntoward stimulating more informed dialogue and provoking questions\nfor which answers may be found. With up-to-date data and additional\nanalyses, the implementation of Kenya\u2019s Economic Recovery Strategy\n(and its successor strategy) can be targeted to specific geographic areas\nof the country, focusing on the poor, and making better use of Kenya\u2019s\nnatural resources.",

Not only does it provide the basic goods\nneeded for survival such as water, food, and fiber, people also rely on\nnature to purify air and water; produce healthy soils; cycle nutrients;\nand regulate climate. Collectively, these benefits derived from nature\u2019s\nsystems are known as ecosystem services.\n\nAbout 80 percent of Kenyans derive their livelihoods from agricultural activities; agriculture contributes, directly and indirectly, about 53\nof the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. Other contributions of ecosystem services to the economy come from tourism based on Kenya\u2019s\nnatural endowment of wildlife, mountains, rangelands, beaches, and\ncoral reefs; as well as timber production from forests; and fish catches\nfrom lakes, rivers, and the Indian Ocean.\nFor a given ecosystem service, the supply is often concentrated\nin specific areas. Understanding where such key resource areas are\nlocated, the ecosystem processes operating to create and maintain\nthese areas, and the services produced and valued by the community\nis essential for managing resources for improved livelihoods and\nsustained use.\nThe maps in Chapter 1 give an overview of Kenya\u2019s physical geog\nraphy; rainfall patterns; major ecosystem types; and densities of wildlife, livestock, and people. They provide a synoptic view of Kenya as a\ncontext for the subsequent chapters on poverty and selected ecosystem\nservices.\n\nSavanna and grassland ecosystems, and bushland and woodland\necosystems cover 39 and 36 percent of Kenya, respectively. Agroecosystems extend over another 19 percent and closed forests make up\nabout 1.7 percent of Kenya\u2019s land area. Urban ecosystems cover only\nabout 0.2 percent of the country.",

(2020) estimate that avoided deforestation in\nthe pantropical region could achieve cost-effective mitigation\nof about 2.8 GtCO2 per year, and a \u201csafeguarded\u201d maximum\nmitigation of about 3.5 GtCO2 per year, both from 2030\nto 2050.[5] With forest action in the tropical zone achieving\none-half as much global average temperature cooling through\nbiophysical pathways as from CO2 alone, the additional global\nclimate cooling benefits of these scenarios would be roughly\nequivalent to the cooling achieved by an additional 1.4 to\n1.8 GtCO2 per year over this period\u2014that our international\nclimate policy is currently ignoring. This scale of additional\nglobal cooling is approximately comparable to all of Russia\u2019s\nanthropogenic GHG emissions reported for 2019.\n\nIf we assume that the amplification rate of global cooling\nfrom reforestation is the same as from avoided deforestation,\nthe global cooling benefits of forest mitigation in the tropics\nwould be even larger. Griscom et al. (2020) estimate costeffective and safeguarded maximum mitigation from both\navoided deforestation and reforestation in the tropics at\n4.0 to 4.7 GtCO2 per year, suggesting an additional global\nbiophysical cooling of 2.00 to 2.35 GtCO2 per year\u2014a\nscale of mitigation comparable to twice Japan\u2019s current\nGHG emissions.\n\nThis calculation attempts to translate the combined\nbiophysical climate effects of forests on the earth's global\naverage surface temperature into a CO2 equivalent and\nrequires assumptions that we know are incorrect\u2014\nsuch as linearly scaling biophysical effects with levels\nof deforestation, and equivalent effects from avoided\ndeforestation and reforestation.",

Indeed, due to the importance of rainfed agriculture to the country\u2019s economy, the drought had already reduced Argentina\u2019s economic growth forecast by a full percentage point, frustrating macroeconomists in the government and at development banks who were working together to reduce fiscal deficits and con- trol inflation.\n\n Maria felt as though she\u2019d seen this movie before: just 10 years earlier in 2008, a major drought in Argen- tina had generated lots of consulting assignments.

To mitigate potential bias in\nresponse rates, for example, where assets with more experience in emissions measuring or environmental activities may\nbe more likely to respond, we reached out early to a range of\nassets across the ECP and provided additional support and\ntraining during the survey implementation.

The survey tool can support\nfaith actors in measuring the emissions of their varied assets\nand documenting their environmental activities. The challenges that arose throughout the pilot act as important lessons\nlearned for future adaptation and implementation. The pilot\nalso highlighted key opportunities, beyond measuring emissions, in terms of inventorying assets and capacity building\naround environmental awareness.\n\nOnce faith actors calculate emissions measurements, they\ncan use these measurements to develop targets for emission\nreductions that can then be tracked with annual repetition\nof the survey. The process of establishing regular emissions\nsurveys will also help prepare the ECP for involvement in\nthe development of further SBT tools, which will align ECP\nmeasurements with the full SBT structure. Furthermore, faith\nactors with asset inventories and emissions measurements\nin place will be well-prepared to engage with and evidence\ntheir contribution to climate action. The ECP plans to rerun\nthe survey annually and report on emissions measurements\nin its annual parochial reports. We hope that other faith\nactors that want to measure their emissions and eventually\nwork toward science-based emission reduction targets will\ntake up the model.",

Therefore, it could be viewed\nas pertaining to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and\nanthropogenic removals that are covered by national inventories (i.e.,\nthe six or seven greenhouse gases and a set of activities linked to\nland use, land use change, and forestry). Accordingly, emissions will\nbe sequestered by removals that occur as a result of human activities\nthat enhance sinks, as opposed to natural sinks.

For example, a multilateral development bank may argue that\n\nfinancing natural gas is compatible with low-emissions and climateresilient development pathways. If, however, other financial actors\nalso invest heavily in natural gas, the associated emissions are likely\nto exceed the global emissions budget (see Christianson et al. 2017).\n\n14. \u201cRead in the light of Article 4.9, therefore, the term \u2018to inform\n\nParties\u2019 must entail some kind of action on the part of the Parties\nreceiving that information. This would suggest that the global\nstocktake outcome would play at least some role in the domestic\nplanning processes. At a minimum, Parties would have to consider\nthe outcomes\u2014be it information, any recommendations or other\nforms of results from the global stocktake\u2014in their planning.

        "c06fb987-9634-44b6-a9bd-cd76b751350f": "In the following pages we offer preliminary answers to these questions. At least in\n_principle, it is possible to integrate our national environmental and economic objectives more fully_\nthan has so far been the case. And, at least in principle, the various entities involved in US\nforeign policy have enormous assets and prestige that might be used \u2013 alone or in concert with\nother actors \u2013 to promote private capital flows that are linked to, and achieve profits from,\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nenvironmentally favored activity. The institutional and political obstacles, however, are\nconsiderable. Progress is likely to be severely constrained by the vagueness of our environmental\nagenda, especially when compared to the high level of coordination and support evident among\nthose who are skeptical of this agenda. The lack of a set of priorities shared by various agencies\nin the foreign policy process undermines policy coordination and leads to policy incoherence and\ncontradictory actions. This, in turn, makes it difficult for the US government to establish clear\nlinks between environmental objectives and US foreign policy goals.\n\nIn addition to these political constraints, US foreign policy is hampered by\nmisunderstandings about the impact of private capital flows on the environment (in comparison to\nother factors), combined with a lack of understanding about the ways in which different forms of\nprivate capital (foreign direct investment, commercial bank lending, portfolio management) are\nrelevant to our environmental objectives and priorities. The environmental impacts of private\ncapital vary enormously, and different conceptions of what we should be using as our\nenvironmental baseline make it difficult to assess these impacts. Furthermore, the link between\nindividual actors and the environmental impact of their investments is often unclear or\nunrecognized. While the impact of a small number of large polluters and investors is easy to\nidentify, the impact of many others in this process is not always recognized by the concerned\nanalyst, much less by the individual polluters or investors themselves. The pathways between\nindividual investment decisions and the environment may be quite direct but they are often quite\ncomplicated, without a straightforward or recognized link between individual choices and US\nnational environmental priorities.\n\nEqually important, different actors are receptive to different pressures, incentives and\narguments. Therefore, the most effective approach to influencing private investment flows will\nvary depending on a variety of factors, and the US government will not always be the most able\nor appropriate actor to influence these flows.",
        "4c5b3b29-56a6-4d9e-a58c-b01b134a1616": "In the absence of a persuasive and\ncoordinated response by the Administration, Congress responded immediately to this\npublic sentiment by passing legislation that precluded ratifying a treaty with any alleged\nnegative implications for the US economy.\n\nThe Administration also missed an opportunity at Kyoto to demonstrate leadership\nat home and abroad. Rather than taking advantage of a groundswell of domestic and\ninternational public opinion in favor of environmental action, the US administration\nhesitated \u2013 entering the negotiations with an incomplete policy position, and doing so with\nits primary people responsible for its environmental activities absent.\n\n\u2013 _Three Gorges Dam_\n\nConstruction of the Three Gorges Dam is going ahead without US government\ninput in part because OPIC lacked sufficient economic clout to influence the flow of\nprivate capital into the dam project. US government funding is not likely to be able to\ncompete with private funding on projects of this magnitude. There are, however, various\nways in which the US government could influence the impact of the project on the\nenvironment by focusing its efforts on upstream and downstream industries, sewage\ntreatment plants and so on. We will suggest a variety of ways of doing this \u2013 from\ninfluencing the flow of various forms of private capital into the PRC, to helping the PRC\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelop a banking system that takes environmental concerns into account. Unless the\ngovernment develops a viable strategy that goes beyond dam construction to encompass\nareas in which it could have an influence, it is likely to miss broader opportunities to\nminimize the negative environmental impacts of the dam.\n\n\u2013 _The G-8_\n\nIt is important to recognize that the vast majority of private capital comes from a\nvery small number of advanced industrialized countries that are members of the G-8 and\nOECD. Establishing a common set of environmental objectives and standards in these\nrelatively small groups would be far easier and have a potentially much larger impact on\nthe global environment, than trying to expand environmental initiatives in the World Trade\nOrganization and other global fora. As opposition at the Kyoto conference suggests,\ndistributional concerns between advanced industrialized and developing countries in large\nfora can easily short circuit a mutually beneficial agreement. Negotiations in the G-8 and\nother similar fora can avoid this problem. Unlike global fora, these smaller fora provide an\nideal opportunity for like-minded, similarly situated countries to promote global ecological\nmodernization.",

WHAT OWNERSHIP APPROACHES CAN BE USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR DG IMPLEMENTATION IN YOUR COUNTRY?\n\n\nA variety of ownership models can be applied both at\nthe isolated-systems level and at the mini-grid level, and\neach model carries implications for the sustainability and\nfinancial viability of the project. DG systems can be owned\nby governments (including public utilities), communities,\nthe private sector, individuals, or by some combination\nof these actors, and at multiple levels. Governments may\nown systems at municipal, state, or central level. Municipal ownership of mini-hydro grids has been employed in\nBolivia, while state-level ownership of diesel mini-grids\nand solar home systems has been employed in Cambodia\nand Mexico, respectively. Nongovernmental ownership,\nmeanwhile, can take the form of individual, cooperative, or community ownership of distributed-generation\nassets. In India, while many publicly supported mini-grid\nprojects are promoted by the central Ministry of New and\nRenewable Energy, most are structured around a Village\nEnergy Committee or Rural Electric Co-operative model\n(Palit and Sarangi 2014).\n\nTable 2 highlights commonly used models for home\nsystems and mini-grid, and identifies some advantages\nand disadvantages of those systems. When planning\ndecentralized electrification, it is necessary to consider\nthe types of ownership models available under the regulatory framework, and which is most appropriate given the\nparticular implementation context.\n\nLocal conditions will determine which model is optimal.\nFor example, a dealer model might be more appropriate for a solar-home-systems market that is competitive and economically attractive, while a Fee-for service\n(FFS) model might be superior where the market is less\nattractive on purely commercial terms (for example, lowdensity, low-income communities, which are commonly\ntargeted by rural electrification efforts).",

Subsidies can be targeted both at project developers and consumers. Subsidies for mini-grids are usually\nderived from national and sub-national governments,\ndonors or other electricity consumers (Tenenbaum et\nal. 2014: 12). Subsidies are usually disbursed as capital\nsubsidies, which go toward reducing the upfront costs of\nimplementation of a particular DG technology. General\nexperience with this approach, however, indicates that,\nlike donor grants, one-time capital subsidies do not usually favor the development of sustainable projects over the\nlong term. There is an increasing focus on performancebased subsidies that are disbursed over specified time\nperiods and are linked to the effective delivery of services\nby the project developer (Deshmukh et al. 2013). For\nexample, under India\u2019s remote village electrification\nprogram, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is\ncovering up to 90 percent of the costs of implementing\nsolar PV, biomass, and micro-hydro mini-grid systems.\nThis is tied to a five-year maintenance agreement with the\nproject implementer (Deshmukh et al. 2013).\n\nSubsidies can also be targeted at consumers. Such subsidies might be targeted at reducing household connectioncosts to a mini-grid or used to reduce the tariffs paid by\npoor households for the electricity they consume. Generally, in the electricity sector, a system of cross-subsidization has been used to provide support for lower-income\nconsumers. In this approach, higher-income consumers\npay a slightly higher tariff, which is used to offset a portion of the tariffs paid by lower-income households. (For\n[more on cross-subsidies, see Q10 in 10 Questions to Ask](http://www.wri.org/publication/10-questions-electricity-tariffs)\n[About Electricity Tariffs).",

Access to this kind of financing can be challenging because banks usually perceive poor consumers\nas high risk and, more often than not, are unwilling to\nextend credit to them. Government and donor support can\nprovide loan guarantees to enable poor consumers to gain\naccess to financing. Some microfinance institutions are\nhelping to fill this financing gap.

Tariff methodologies are\nusually designed by national or sub-national\nregulatory agencies. There are two primary\napproaches to feed-in tariff determination: a\ntechnology-specific approach, which involves\nstandardized calculations of tariffs based on\nthe generation costs of specific renewableenergy technologies, and a technologyneutral avoided-cost approach, which sets\ntariff levels based on the utilities\u2019 avoided\ncosts of generating the electricity produced\nby the DG operator (Tenenbaum et al.\n2014).

HOW ARE LONG-TERM TECHNICAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND OTHER CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS FOR DG BEING CONSIDERED?\n\n\nInstitutional capacity, technical knowledge, business skills\nand capacity in DG development, finance, operation, and\nmaintenance are necessary for the successful implementation and expansion of distributed electricity access.\n\nInstitutional and human resource capacity requirements\nfor distributed systems are often different from the typical capacity requirements of a centralized grid system.\nTraining will therefore be required for project developers,\nregulators, utilities, financiers, and, in some cases, consumers.

HOW ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  BEING FACTORED INTO DG PLANNING?\n\n\nWell-planned DG programs can result in positive environmental and social benefits such as improved air\nquality, access to electricity and/or increased economic\nproductivity for households, small businesses or entire\ncommunities. Poorly designed DG electrification plans,\nhowever, can have negative impacts on environmental and\nsocial well-being, including water, air, and noise pollution; disruption of local ecologies; adverse health effects;\nand safety issues, as well as increased social conflict and\ngender and economic divides (Alliance for Rural Electrification 2011).\n\nConsidering the impacts associated with DG early in the\nplanning process can help to mitigate negative impacts,\nand build support for electrification initiatives among\nvarious stakeholders, including policymakers and local\ncommunities. For example, large-scale biomass use can\nincrease competition for land that supports biodiversity\nand the livelihoods of local communities. A country\ncan mandate an impact assessment of land use and\nbiodiversity as a prerequisite for obtaining a license to\noperate a DG system that utilizes biomass on a significant\nscale (see Q10 in 10 Questions to Ask About Scaling\nRenewable Energy).\n\nIn addition to environmental impacts, DG can also have\nadverse social impacts. For example, local economic\ninequality and social conflict can increase if the benefits\nof electrification are enjoyed by only the wealthier households in a community (Alliance for Rural Electrification\n2011: 7, 22; Zerriffi 2011: 170, 175). To minimize the likelihood of both environmental and social adverse effects, Sri\nLanka\u2019s regulatory system includes a rigorous preapproval\nprocess for mini-grid systems that accounts for non-sector\nconsiderations. Obtaining approval under the Sri Lankan\nsystem requires much more than simply submitting an\napplication to the national Sustainable Energy Authority\n(SEA) office. A detailed prefeasibility study must be conducted, which includes obtaining electricity sector approvals, environmental clearances, and projecting electricity\nproduction (Tenenbaum et al. 2014).\n\nElectrification with DG can also have positive social\nimpacts. DG implementation can create downstream jobs\nrelated to project management, system installation, operation, and maintenance (Alliance for Rural Electrification",
        "8462802d-dcc9-4fc0-9a43-214ccb240f41": "2011: 21). For example, an assessment of the employment\npotential of a DG project can help in forecasting human\nresources requirements in cases where job creation is an\nobjective of the electrification effort. Such information\ncan include the projected number of jobs, types of jobs,\nand human know-how necessary for plan implementation\n(Wood et al. 2014: 20).\n\nIt is important that the impact assessment process be participatory so that the views of those affected by the project\nboth positively and negatively are recognized. Impact\nassessments should be particularly sensitive to the views\nof marginalized members of communities. A participatory\nprocess that ensures that the views of women are captured can enable a clearer understanding of their links to\nresources such as land, water, and biomass. Such understanding will sometimes be important for the development\nof DG options. Women might depend directly on these\nresources for agriculture and household energy. Considerations of the gender implications of resource use in DG\ndevelopment is critical to ensure that the development\nof DG options does not result in negative impacts and/or\nhamper access to resources for women or other marginalized members of society. Understanding and communicating potential positive and negative impacts of DG project\ncan help assuage stakeholder anxiety and garner support\nfor decentralized electricity plans. If assessments are made\npublicly available and the public is given opportunities for\nconsultation in the electrification plan, local communities can have a greater participatory role in the planning\nprocess. This presents the opportunity to address local\nstakeholder concerns and increase acceptance of distributed-generation systems among local communities. Effective mechanisms should also be set up to offer redress for\nconsumer grievances (Deshmukh et al. 2013).\n\nConducting impact assessments takes time and resources,\nhowever, and can be cumbersome for dealers trying to\nsell smaller capacity systems (for example, solar home\nsystems). Governments can decide to require impact\nassessments only in the case of specific system sizes with\npotential for creating significant environmental impacts,\nin order to reduce the burden associated with project\ndevelopment. Ultimately, the protection of environmental\nand social interests should be the key determinant of any\nsuch decision.\n\n\n-----",

Based on this analysis, several sites showed spikes in emissions and/or had\nemissions exceed removals and were further investigated. These and other sites were cross-checked\nagainst on-the-ground information compiled from the monitoring process of the World Heritage\nConvention[4] and the IUCN World Heritage Outlook of 2020[5], which helped to identify the specific\npressures that were most likely to have influenced a landscape\u2019s local carbon budget over the last 20\nyears.\n\nOn average, forests in natural and mixed UNESCO World Heritage sites have absorbed\napproximately 190 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere annually since the year 2000. This\nnet CO2 removal by forests is equivalent to roughly half of the United Kingdom\u2019s annual CO2 emissions\nfrom fossil fuels in 2019[6]. Sequestration over centuries or millennia by World Heritage forests has\nresulted in total carbon storage of approximately 13 billion tonnes, which exceeds the carbon in\nKuwait\u2019s proven oil reserves[7]. The sites with the largest net carbon sinks and stores were generally in\ntropical and temperate regions.\n\nWorld Heritage forests provide critical climate benefits only if safeguarded from threats. Despite\ntheir globally recognized and protected status, forests in 10 World Heritage sites were net carbon\nsources during the 2001-2020 period. In the future, ongoing removal of atmospheric CO2 by forests\nat these sites is not guaranteed if threats to their conservation continue.

Cavendish\u2019s survey of\nnearly 200 households excluded farm income, concentrating on\nwild income from forests and other natural sources, particularly\ncommon areas in the public domain. He found that this kind of\nenvironmental income constituted over 35 percent of total household income. It was not usually obtained from one source, but\nmany small sources combined. Households derived direct subsistence value from collecting firewood, consuming fruits and berries,\nand browsing their livestock. They received cash income from the\nsale of materials, fruits, medicines, or meat they had collected or\nhunted. They even derived some income from small-scale gold\npanning. Cavendish also found that the dependence of households\non environmental income decreased as their average incomes rose.\nAlthough the poor tended to get more of their total income from\nthe environment, the rich still made heavy use of natural products\nfor income (Cavendish 2000:1979, 1990, 1991).\n\n\n**TABLE 2.2 DIVERSE USES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME**\n\n\n**Location**\n\nShindi Ward,\nSouthern Zimbabwe\n\nSouthern Malawi\n\nGulf of Mannar,\nIndia\n\nCoquimbo Region,\nChile\n\nIquitos, Peru\n\nBudongo Forest,\nUganda\n\nBushbuckridge\nDistrict, South Africa\n\nChimaliro Forest\nReserve, Malawi\n\nJhabua, Madhya\nPradesh, India\n\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\nForests\nand grasslands\n\nForest\n\nReefs\n\nSemi-Arid\n\nTropical forest\n\nSemi-deciduous\ntropical forest\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture",

Despite the unquestioned importance of coastal and inland fisheries to the poor, small-scale\nfisheries are also an overlooked resource in most poverty alleviation\nstrategies (B\u00e9n\u00e9 2003:949). Again, this reflects the fact that fisheries\nincome for the poor frequently escapes official notice, since fish are often\nlocally consumed, and often at home.

Better valuation and accounting of wild\nincome, as well as income from home-based agriculture, is part of any\nsensible strategy to incorporate environmental income into poverty reduction programs.",

Roads\nand rail links are usually scarce, often in disrepair, and\nfrequently impassable. This puts transportation high\non the list of critical factors determining the commercial viability of ecosystem goods and services that the\nrural poor may wish to market. In the remote Iquitos\nregion of Peru, for example, transportation costs are\noften the deciding factor in what is marketed\n(Neumann and Hirsch 2000:51-52).\nFresh fruits, vegetables, fish, milk, and other perishable items are particularly subject to the limitations of\ntransport infrastructure. In Nigeria\u2019s Niger River delta\nregion, marketing of the African or Bush Pear\n_(Dacryodes edulis)\u2014a nutritious and valuable fruit much_\nin demand\u2014is held back by impassable roads during the\nrainy season, just when the pear is bearing most heavily\n(Adewusi 2004:144). Likewise, a market analysis of palm\nfruits harvested in the one of Brazil\u2019s Extractive Reserves\nfound that it was only profitable to market those fruits\npicked within 114 km of a market\u2014about 3.5 days travel\ntime. Beyond that, it was too slow and too costly to be\nworth the effort (Neumann and Hirsch 2000:52).\nOf course, the need to provide efficient rural\ntransportation goes well beyond its importance to\nbuilding markets for ecosystem goods. It is a basic\nrequirement for rural development more broadly.\nStudies show that transportation deficits and bottlenecks are an obstacle to economic growth. The\nconnection of roads to poverty reduction is also wellunderstood. A recent study shows that living close to\na highway decreases a household\u2019s chance of being\npoor by 17 percent and increases its access to work by\n32 percent (Manasseh and Chopra 2004). Nonetheless,\nproviding adequate rural transportation has been a\nconstant challenge for national and local governments due to\nthe high costs of transport infrastructure, and it is likely that\ngetting products to market will remain a lingering problem for\npoor producers.",

In 1990 the U.S. company Smith and\nHawken faced growing consumer demand for sustainably\nharvested tropical hardwoods such as mahogany for furniture\nand other high-end home furnishings. In response, it helped\n_campesino forestry groups in northern Honduras\u2014community_\norganizations of 5-50 members that manage state forests\nunder use agreements with the government\u2014attain certification for their mahogany and other hardwoods. The campesino\ngroups are now using the publicity they have received to\nexpand the market for less well-known woods (Mayers and\nVermeulen 2002:147).\nArrangements like the ones undertaken by Swiss Lumber\nand Smith and Hawken to contract with rural farmers to\nsupply trees are perhaps the most common arrangements\nbetween poor households and natural resource companies.\nThese \u201coutgrower\u201d schemes are programs where timber\ncompanies pay small farmers to plant trees on their own (or\nsometimes communal) land in order to ensure a reliable supply\nof timber in the future. The schemes, which can be found in\nmany countries on every continent, vary widely by company\nand by country. In some, the company provides seedlings,\naccess to credit, technical help in planting and caring for the\ntrees, and even the construction of roads for harvest. In other\ncases, the arrangements are more sparse, with no finance and\nlittle other than seedlings and an offer to buy the trees at\nmarket price (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:140-154).\nThe poverty-reduction potential of outgrower schemes\nvaries, but can be sizable. In the South African province of\nKwaZulu Natal, some 10,000 farmers\u2014more than half of them\nwomen\u2014participate in the outgrower programs of the Sappi and\nMondi paper companies. With materials supplied by the companies, the farmers grow eucalyptus trees on their small plots of a\nfew hectares. Sappi and Mondi agree to purchase the plantation\nwood after 6-7 years for their pulp mills.",

In several\ncases, donors have pressed reluctant governments to provide\nopportunities for significant engagement of civil society in PRSP\nprocesses. Indeed, closer relationships between civil society\nand donors has been an outgrowth of the evolution of PRSP\nprocesses in several countries (PRSP Monitoring and Synthesis\nProject 2002:5).\nIn the PRSPs of many countries, poverty diagnosis and\nanalysis emphasize technical solutions to poverty-environment\nissues. Less frequently do PRSPs address more controversial,\npolitically charged issues of access, ownership, control, and rights\nto environmental resources and how these impact the poor\u2019s\ncapacity to derive environmental income from productive assets.\nHowever, in a few instances, participation by activist NGOs has\nbegun to shape the content of poverty analysis in PRSPs; for\nexample, the PRSPs of Uganda and Honduras have begun to\naddress issues of access to and control of natural resources in\nresponse to concerns expressed in consultations with civil society\n(Waldman et al. 2005:32).\nAnother oversight in many PRSPs is the failure to assess the\npotential impacts of proposed growth policies on environmental\nsustainability, maintenance of critical ecosystem functioning,\nand key natural resources relied on by the poor for their livelihoods (Oksanen and Mersmann 2003:137). For example, PRSPs\nfrequently propose incentives to encourage high-input, exportoriented agriculture to stimulate economic growth, yet rarely do\nthey analyze the risks of this approach for harming small-scale\nrural farmers and weakening their ability to manage local\nnatural resources (Tharakan and MacDonald 2004:25).\nThe PRSP of Nicaragua refers to intensive production of\ncash crops, including coffee, for export, but this discussion does\nnot include measures to improve food security or to diversify\nrural incomes through nonfarm activities (Tharakan and\nMacDonald 2004:32)."
