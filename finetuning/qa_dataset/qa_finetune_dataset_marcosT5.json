Time required for soil reclamation to restore soil quality to premined conditions in southeastern United States is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate chronosequence effects on restoration quality indicators in reclaimed coal mine soil from different land use landscapes and agroecosystems in Mississippi. Study sites in 0-to 3-, 5to 7-, and 10-to 12-year-old reclaimed soils were compared with adjacent undisturbed sites. Soil samples collected at the 0-to 15-cm and the 15-to 30-cm depths within a grid in a radius of 3 m were mixed to produce composite samples and kept frozen until analyzed. Soil bulk density (\u03c1b) was the highest (1.48 g cm -3 ) in the youngest (<1 year) site and decreased with increasing age to the oldest (12-year) site (1.07 g cm -3 ). Soil quality indicators (aggregate stability, total C, organic C, and microbial biomass C) increased with increasing reclamation age in forest and grass ecosystems. Concentrations of C were greater at the summit than at shoulder and foot-slope positions. Soil pH, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn were higher in newly reclaimed soil than in soils reclaimed 12 years earlier possibly because of reclamation liming practices, which buffer pH to greater than 7.0 in newly reclaimed sites. Reclamation practices improved soil quality over time. Soil quality indicators reached levels similar to those of undisturbed soil within 7 to 12 years after reclamation, indicating successful reestablishment of healthy and sustainable soils in the postmining ecosystems.",

However, understanding the relations between tree growth and soil fertility attributes along slopes of degraded mine sites by reforestation is limited, especially in Ghana. Therefore, a study was carried out at a rehabilitated degraded land to determine the influence of slope on soil fertility attributes and growth performance of trees. Plots were laid in the upslope, midslope and downslope, with an adjacent undisturbed forest as a control for sampling purposes. Soil samples were collected (0-15 and 15-30 cm depth) from the various sampling locations to determine soil properties, as well as tree growth parameters (e.g., height, basal area, and biomass). Slope positions impacted on tree growth (above and below ground biomass, and basal area) and soil properties. Highest soil organic carbon (1.80%), total N (0.22%), available P (6.92 mg kg -1 ), exchangeable K (0.20 cmol c kg -1 ), and NO 3 --N (19.03 mg N kg -1 ) were observed at the midslope position, whilst the upslope recorded the least values. The results also revealed that the midslope position recorded the highest tree growth characteristics. Aboveground biomass ranged from 17.67 to 21.73 mg ha -1 , indicating the trees' potential as carbon sinks. Furthermore, principal component analysis revealed that 3 components had their eigenvalues > 1, and accounted for 79.50% of the total variance. These results clearly demonstrate that spatial variations in soil properties are influenced by slope, and gives reference for future rehabilitation processes by reforestation.",

However, mining activities ultimately lead to land degradation which has substantial effect on forest resources and ecosystem biodiversity [41] . Mining is currently the leading cause of loss of forest vegetation in Ghana [47] . Surface mining has been reported to have depleted over 15% of Ghana's remaining 240,0 0 0 km 2 forest vegetation cover [3] . It is also estimated that, about 4 million and 1.25 million hectares of lands have been destroyed by surface mining in China and USA respectively [10] . To curb the negative effects of such activities on the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana goes into a rehabilitation bond with mining companies towards the rehabilitation of disturbed land [3] . As a means to restore disturbed forest covers, mining companies use revegetation as a reclamation tool [40] . Revegetation and restoration as a tool for rehabilitating mined lands has been studied by many researchers and incorporates certain multipurpose trees to enhance regeneration of indigenous tree species on rehabilitated sites [29] . However, growth performance of such important tree species during rehabilitation is impacted by topographic (e.g. slope, aspect) attributes, soil fertility (e.g., N, P, K, CEC, etc), water, and clay mineralogy [29] . Soil as a medium for tree growth is influenced by soil-forming factors which includes topography, climatic variations, parent material, living organisms, and time. Of all these soil-forming factors, relief (e.g., aspect, slope position and gradient) has been recognized as an important abiotic factor that influences changes in soil properties and localized microclimates (e.g., light, temperature, humidity) within tree stands [36] . Therefore, topography as a soil-forming factor may impact on tree growth by influencing spatial changes in soil attributes [27] . Clemens et al.",

The influence of slope and nutrient variability on plant growth has basically been extensively studied under grass and agricultural land systems, as well as some forest ecosystems [ 28 , 29 ]. However, few studies have been done on the interrelations between slope gradients, tree growth, and soil fertility attributes in the area of reclaiming degraded mine sites, especially in Ghana. Also, understanding the impact of slope gradients on soil fertility and its resultant influence on tree growth is limited. This study was therefore carried out to examine whether slope positions will impact on tree growth characteristics (tree height, diameter, volume, and biomass) by causing spatial variation in soil properties including soil organic carbon, microbial biomass, nitrogen, and water content in a sloped terrain of a reclaimed land in a tropical region, Ghana. Disregarding the aspect of slope position of inclined vegetations may lead to over or under estimation of soil properties in relation to tree growth. Relevant data from this study will help in the on-going discussions and better understanding between mining companies, forestry commission, and the EPA on the management and relationships between tree growth and soil fertility attributes along slopes of a land for reclamation practices by reforestation.",

The objectives of this study were to assess the improvement in mine soil quality and C sequestration potential of the post emining reclaimed land with time. Hence, this study was conducted in reclaimed chronosequence sites (young, intermediate and old) of a large open cast coal project (Central Coal Fields Limited, Jharkhand, India) and results were compared to a reference forest site (Sal forest, Shorea robusta). Mine soil quality was assessed in terms of accretion of soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N) and soil CO 2 flux along with the age of revegetation. After 14 years of revegetation, SOC and N concentrations increased three and five-fold, respectively and found equivalent to the reference site. Accretion of SOC stock was estimated to be 1.9 Mg C ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 . Total ecosystem C sequestered after 2e14 years of revegetation increased from 8 Mg C ha \u00c01 to 90 Mg C ha \u00c01 (30e333 Mg CO 2 ha \u00c01 ) with an average rate of 6.4 Mg C ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 .

CO 2 flux increased with age of revegetation and found 11, 33 and 42 Mg CO 2 ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 in younger, intermediate and older dumps, respectively. Soil respiration in revegetated site is more influenced by the temperature than soil moisture. Results of the study also showed that trees like, Dalbergia sissoo and Heterophragma adenophyllum should be preferred for revegetation of mine degraded sites.",

Anthropogenic activities, particularly, surface mining can potentially increase the global emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by deforestation and land degradation. Although surface mining can deteriorate environmental quality, it also provides a unique opportunity to study rejuvenation of ecosystem in post-mining site. Revegetation of post-mining site can sequester atmospheric carbon (C) in the soil and biomass for longer time and plays an important role in combating global warming (IPCC, 2000;Ussiri and Lal, 2005). The development of forest cover on post-mining land is always a challenging task for land managers and restoration ecologists due to complete destruction of ecosystem attributes. Surface mining removes vegetation, topsoil and subsoil cover entirely, which significantly reduces the C stock, soil fertility as well as destroyed the C sink (Akala and Lal, 2001;Licina et al., 2017). To reach the coal seam, overburden (OB) rocks were removed and stored as OB dumps initially (i.e., external OB dumps) and later on were used to fill mine voids (i.e., internal dumping). These OB materials are generally known as mine spoils and when it reclaimed by plantation with or without addition of topsoil it termed as reclaimed mine soil (RMS). In comparison to natural soils, mine soils are pedogenically young and often characterized by its poor soil structure lacking distinctive soil horizons, nutrient deprived condition and categories as anthrosols (Sencindiver and Ammons, 2000;Shrestha and Lal, 2006;Ahirwal and Maiti, 2016;Spargo and Doley, 2016).",

This involves regeneration of mine soil fertility, improvement of soil characteristics, re-establishment of vegetation cover, enhancement of nutrient stock, and improved biomass productivity. Mine soil are characterized by high rock fragments (40e60%), low water holding capacity, high bulk density and low soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, and phosphorus contents compared to natural soil. During technical reclamation, use of heavy earth moving machinery resulting in compact surface, low porosity, poor aeration and high bulk density (> 1.6 Mg m \u00c03 ), which promotes establishment of grasses and weeds (Maiti, 2012;Ahirwal and Maiti, 2016). Establishment of vegetation cover initiates paedogenesis process on bare overburden dumps, and improves its physical, chemical and biological properties over time. Geo-chemical characteristics of overburden materials, prevailing climate, age of the site and vegetation characteristics are key drivers of SOC accumulation and C sequestration (Ussiri and Lal, 2005;Vinduskova and Frouz, 2013;Das and Maiti, 2016a). Maiti (2012) emphasized that the magnitude and direction of change in the SOC pool depends on management and after care of reclaimed sites and additional biomass inputs, while developing a forest as post-mining land use. In recent past, rather than just redeveloping the forest, more emphasis is being shifted to assess the health of reclaimed site and to quantify C sequestration potential of the revegetated sites by field study, modelling and remote sensing (Amichev et al., 2008;Karan et al., 2016;Quinkenstein and Jochheim, 2016;Ahirwal et al., 2017).",

The literature has shown different levels of C pool in post-mining land reclaimed for pasture (Akala and Lal, 2000), woody plants (Singh et al., 2006), mixed plantation (Amichev et al., 2008), grassland (Chatterjee et al., 2009) and forest (Tripathi et al., 2014;Das and Maiti, 2016a). The variations in C pool can be attributed to varied geographical condition, age, species composition and use of different methods to estimate C pools. Studies on C sequestration in revegetated coal mine land are scarce for the dry tropical climate, therefore, to fulfill the knowledge gap, a study was carried out to estimate the C sequestration potential in post-mining sites of various ages and to study the relationship of soil respiration with ecosystem development. The objectives of the present study were (i) to assess the changes in mine soil quality with the age of revegetation, and (ii) to estimate the accretion of C stock and soil CO 2 flux in revegetated post-mining sites.",

A field study was conducted in the 5-year-old unreclaimed dump and reclaimed coal mine dump to assess the changes in soil CO 2 flux and compared with the reference forest site. Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen stocks were estimated in post-mining land. Soil CO 2 flux was measured using close dynamic chamber method, and the influence of environmental variables on soil CO 2 flux was determined. Woody biomass C and SOC stocks of the reference forest site were threefold higher than that of 5-year-old reclaimed site. The mean soil CO 2 flux was highest in 5-year-old reclaimed dump (2.37 \u03bcmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 ) and lowest in unreclaimed dump (0.21 \u03bcmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 ). Soil CO 2 flux was highly influenced by environmental variables, where soil temperature positively influenced the soil CO 2 flux, while soil moisture, relative humidity and surface CO 2 concentration negatively influenced the soil CO 2 flux. Change in soil CO 2 flux under different land cover depends on plant and soil characteristics and environmental variables. The study concluded that assessment of soil CO 2 flux in post-mining land is important to estimate the potential of afforestation to combat increased emission of soil CO 2 at regional and global scale.",

To combat the impact of global warming, effective management strategies are urgently required. Soil carbon (C) is the largest terrestrial C pool and stored more C than that of biomass and the atmosphere (Scharlemann et al. 2014;Bond-Lamberty and Thomson 2010). Soils sequestered approximately 2500 Pg C (Lal 2008) and release 94.3 \u00b1 17.9 Pg C year -1 through soil respiration (R S ) (Xu and Shang 2016). Apart from anthropogenic sources, C released in response to R S is a major source of atmospheric CO 2 and a small change in soil CO 2 flux can greatly affect the ecosystem C balance (Kutsch et al. 2009;Bond-Lamberty and Thomson 2010). Thereby, soil has received remarkable attention from the global community to offset increased CO 2 emissions. In India, 76.87 million hectares of land is under forest and tree cover that potentially store 6621.53 million tonnes (Mt) of C (Kishwan et al. 2009). Earlier, total soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential of India was estimated to be 12.7-16.5 Pg C year -1 (Lal 2004). Recently, however, SOC stocks under different land uses in India was reported to be 22.72 Pg and total C stocks 35.55 Pg (Sreenivas et al. 2016). Conversely, escalated land use and land cover change due to anthropogenic activities, particularly surface mining, significantly decreases the terrestrial C pool. India produced 639 Mt of coal during 2015-2016(MOC 2017)), of which more than 92% was produced by openstrip mining.",
        "521e3548-ac26-49bd-852b-b4606f182043": "During this process entire vegetation cover is removed, and topsoil is scrapped out to reach the coal seam. As a result, the permanent CO 2 sink is completely destroyed which led to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Amichev et al. 2008). After the excavation of coal, mine voids are generally backfilled with the overburden (OB) materials and reclaimed through technical and biological reclamation practices. Technical reclamation involved benching, regrading and then spreading of topsoil on the backfilled dumps. Thereafter, dumps are revegetated with the grass-legumes mixture and often afforested with fastgrowing tree species to re-establish natural C sink (Ahirwal and Maiti 2017). In India, poor technical reclamation of post-mining sites such as no topsoiling and regrading of OB materials may delay the rejuvenation of degraded sites. In addition, several adverse mine spoil properties like high temperature, low moisture, low SOC and nutrient poor conditions often limit the vegetation growth (Maiti 2012). In the view of the above, surface mining can directly or indirectly increase the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Thus, the implementation of proper reclamation and management practices to restore mine-degraded land is one of the viable alternatives to combat global warming. Soil CO 2 fluxes and SOC pools in the natural forest were studied in many countries due to its role in global C cycle and its impact on climate change. However, CO 2 flux in unreclaimed and reclaimed coal mine dumps in a tropical ecosystem or elsewhere are rarely reported. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of reclamation on soil properties, C pool and soil CO 2 flux of unreclaimed and reclaimed coal mine dumps in a humid subtropical climate.",

In reference forest site, older tree species accumulate higher woody biomass resulting in higher biomass C pool of the area. On contrary, woody biomass C of the reclaimed coal mine dumps was 67% less compared to the forest. This clearly indicates that surface mining potentially reduced the ability of biomass to absorb atmospheric CO 2 (Huang et al. 2015). Afforestation of fast-growing tree accounted for 9.03 Mg C ha -1 compared to unreclaimed dump that indicates the accretion of tree C stock along the age of revegetation. The mean annual increment in the tree C stock of the reclaimed dump was 1.8 Mg ha -1 year -1 . Particle size analysis showed that unreclaimed mine spoil contains less fine earth fraction (31%) compared to RMS (54%) and forest soil (88%). In addition, forest soil showed a high amount of clay particles and unreclaimed mine spoil exhibit a high amount of sand and silt particles. The less amount of fine earth fraction attributes to the poor reclamation conditions. Application of topsoil up to 0.2-0.3 m and up to 1 m in some cases prior to plantation has been reported in various reclamation studies (Akala and Lal 2001;Rivas-P\u00e9rez et al. 2016;Qu et al. 2017). However, in the present study topsoil had not been applied to dump surface. Proper regrading of spoil material which contains a larger fraction of rock debris and boulder has not be done properly that resulted in a higher coarse fraction in unreclaimed mine spoil. Since the plantation has been carried out on the same bare surface, low soil fraction was reported in the afforested site. On the other side, reference forest site which has not been influenced due to anthropogenic activities and showed the virgin soil characteristics containing high fine earth fraction compare to mining affected lands.",

For instance, Mukhopadhyay and Masto (2016) reported coarse fraction ranged from 40 to 70% in the revegetated mine soils. In another study, authors also reported up to 71% coarse fraction in unreclaimed mine spoil and identified one of the most influencing parameters affecting soil quality (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2016). Study of the development of soil quality in revegetated post-mining land shows 73% of coarse fraction in 2-year-old revegetated site that decreased with the age of revegetation (Ahirwal and Maiti 2017). Continuous dumping of OB materials using heavy dumpers compacted the dump surface and higher coarse fraction together resulted in a high bulk density of the unreclaimed mine spoil. During reclamation, topsoil was mixed in  plantation pit only to assist the establishment of plants and accretion of soil nutrients. Plant available N, available P and exchangeable K were significantly reduced in the unreclaimed mine spoil due to the removal of vegetation and top fertile soil during surface mining activities. The presence of boulders and high rock fraction in the unreclaimed mine spoil significantly reduced the CEC compare to the reference forest site. SOC and TN concentrations were significantly higher in the reference forest soil compared to both unreclaimed mine spoil and RMS. Surface mining decline 87% SOC and 71% TN content attributable to the loss of top fertile layer and tree cover. Development of soil microfaunal communities may help in the formation of the organo-mineral layer through bioturbation of litter and spoil materials that release more plant nutrients into the soils. In an earlier stage of reclamation, soil faunal community developed at a faster rate compared to the later stages of tree developments (Frouz et al. 2007). In the present study, a substantial amount of SOC and plant available N in the 5-year-old RMS may be because of the higher litter fall and its microbial degradation and dominance of N-fixing tree species.",

However, development of SOC stocks in the secondary forest also relies on soil type and plant species (Paz et al. 2016). Changes in mine soil properties can be attributed to the age of afforestation, plant species, prevailing climatic conditions and parent rock material (Shrestha et al. 2013). Assessment of the soil properties in surface mining induced land use in the tropical Sal forest revealed that SOC concentration was 70% less in the 5-year-old RMS compared to native forest soil (Ahirwal and Maiti 2016). Unreclaimed mine spoil exhibits only 5% of the SOC stock present in reference forest soil that can be explained by the high rock debris that contained very less amount of SOC. Unreclaimed mine spoils exhibit higher amount of geogenic organic matter (OM) which contain a substantial amount of fossil C and organic N that are resistance to microbial degradation (Waschkies and H\u00fcttl 1999;Reeder 1998;Frouz et al. 2007). The presence of geogenic OM might also influence the establishment of a C requiring microflora in mine soils (Waschkies and H\u00fcttl 1999). In Indian mining conditions, fossil C reported in the range of 55-68% in unreclaimed mine spoil and 24-47% in reclaimed mine soil (Das and Maiti 2016). The amount of SOC stored in the 5-year-old RMS was only 32% of the reference forest soils that may gradually approach to reference forest soils with the passage of time. Similarly, unreclaimed mine spoil exhibits 0.37 Mg N ha -1 which is 11% of the reference forest site. In RMS, TN stock was 1.24 \u00b1 0.15 Mg N ha -1 which was 37% of the reference forest soils.",

Afforestation of N-fixing plants such as A. lebbeck, A. procera and D. sissoo on the mine spoil may account for higher N stocks. Decomposition of litter, dead biomass contributed by grass and development of roots biomass can increase the SOC stocks in the upper depth of the RMS. Singh et al. (2006) reported that mine soils can accumulate 5.80 Mg C ha -1 and 0.55 Mg N ha -1 after 5 years of afforestation with A. lebbeck in a tropical climate. RMS (0-5 cm) under normal reclamation practices in Eastern Ohio stored an average of 11.83 Mg C ha -1 and 1.15 Mg N ha -1 (Shrestha et al. 2009). SOC developments in RMS (0-30 cm) of the Indian dry tropical climate were studied by Tripathi et al. (2016) and reported 13.70 Mg C ha -1 after 4 years of afforestation. Estimates of the SOC and TN stocks in the present study are different compared to the other similar studies that may be explained by the different substrate conditions, plant species, climatic conditions and reclamation practices. SOC stocks accumulated in RMS at a rate of 1.5 Mg C ha -1 year -1 after 5 years of reclamation. In similar environmental conditions, Ahirwal and Maiti (2017) reported C accumulation at an average rate of 1.9 Mg C ha -1 year -1 after 14 years of reclamation. Tripathi et al.

Although it cannot be directly compared to other sites, the rate of SOC accumulation can be varied with the site age, vegetation cover and climatic conditions (Vinduskova and Frouz 2013). Total C pool (tree + soil) of the reference forest, reclaimed dump and unreclaimed dump found in the order of 50.82 Mg C ha -1 > 16.58 Mg C ha -1 > 1.10 Mg C ha -1 . After 5 years of reclamation, mine soil sequestered only 32% of the reference forest C pool.

Average soil CO 2 flux from the unreclaimed mine spoil, RMS and reference forest soil was largely varied on the spatial scale. Soil CO 2 flux found lowest in the month of December when the temperature reached to its minimum, while the surface CO 2 concentration reached its maximum compared to other months. In the unreclaimed dump, very less soil CO 2 flux may correspond to the geological origin where coal C and rock bound inorganic C oxidized and releases CO 2 into the atmosphere. Evidence from the studies carried out in the mining area showed the contribution of inorganic carbon flux in CO 2 emission (Vesper et al. 2016). The excavated mine spoil with little admixture of coal was dumped, where heat produced by the high temperature and burning of coal shell contributed to soil CO 2 efflux in unreclaimed dumps (Mathiba et al. 2015;Rey 2015). Moreover, the release of soil CO 2 due to temperature fluctuation, carbonate weathering and evaporation of water from soil solution causes non-biological CO 2 production which increases the soil CO 2 flux (Rey 2015;Xu and Shang 2016). Unreclaimed dump showed very less SOC stocks compared to reference forest site and completely devoid of vegetation cover that was also responsible for very low soil respiration.

Mukhopadhyay and Maiti (2014) reported an average of 2.10 \u03bcmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 annual soil CO 2 flux in RMS of India. Soil CO 2 is mainly produced by the root and microbial respiration (Bond-Lamberty and Thomson 2010). After 5 years of reclamation, plant growth and development of soil in the reclaimed site increased the root biomass (4.21 mg ha -1 ) and high amount of SOC act as a substrate to increase microbial activity that in turn increases root respiration. Variation in soil CO 2 flux among the study site may also be explained by the C input to soils that may vary with the plant species, litter fall and its soil ameliorating capacity (Kuzyakov and Domanski 2000;Xu and Shang 2016). The rate of CO 2 production is highly affected by environmental variables such as soil temperature and moisture (Davidson and Janssens 2006;Wei et al. 2014). The study determines the effect of surface CO 2 concentration, soil temperature, moisture and relative humidity on the soil CO 2 flux using linear regression analysis and found the changes in soil CO 2 flux with a change in an environmental variable. Soil CO 2 flux showed the adjusted R 2 values for the soil temperature under reference forest (0.85), reclaimed dump (0.83) and unreclaimed dump (0.82) that confirm the influence of temperature on soil CO 2 flux.",

However, few studies have neglected the direct effect of temperature on soil CO 2 flux (Kuzyakov and Gavrichkova 2010;Vargas et al. 2010;Xu and Shang 2016). Although temperature and moisture may not have a direct effect on CO 2 flux rate, it plays an important role to modify associated microbial processes (Xu and Shang 2016). Elevated soil temperature and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations increase the plant photosynthesis rate that leads to higher C accumulation. Simultaneously, the increase in plant biomass C increases the root respiration rate that balances the C cycle. Increase in soil CO 2 efflux with an increase in soil temperature can be explained by an increase in root growth and decomposition of soil organic matter (Shrestha et al. 2013). The higher-temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ) of the soil CO 2 flux was found in unreclaimed mine spoil followed by RMS and reference forest soil. This showed that possible increase in temperature in future may increase the CO 2 flux rate in abandoned mine spoil compared to other sites. Thus, afforestation can be a promising tool to offset the increase in soil CO 2 emission. Soil moisture content was varied among the studied sites and does not have much influence on soil CO 2 flux except in reclaimed site. The negative relation between the soil CO 2 flux and soil moisture content in the mining area is in line with a study carried out by Mathiba et al. (2015) in the mining areas of the USA. Thus, it can be concluded that apart from soil and plant characteristics, the environmental variable also plays an important role in CO 2 emission and terrestrial C balance.",

C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystem refers to the conversion of atmospheric CO 2 into the carbonaceous components by the plants or geological processes that can be stored as carbohydrates, soil organic matter (SOM), and carbonate minerals. Once the CO 2 has been transferred into these materials, it is effectively locked until decomposition occurs. These processes can be affected by many factors, such as species characteristics and age of vegetation, climatic conditions, land use, and soil type. Globally, soil is the largest terrestrial C sink stored approximately 2157-2293 Pg (petagram = 10 15 g) of C to 1 m depth (Batjes, 2014). The terrestrial C pool consists of both organic C (OC) and inorganic C (IC) stored in soils and vegetation. Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) pool mostly includes elemental C and carbonate minerals such as CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 , whereas soil organic carbon (SOC) consists of plantderived C and highly active humus. Recycling of C in a terrestrial ecosystem is mainly accomplished by photoautotrophs that use light energy from the sun to convert atmospheric CO 2 into the organic matter and more complex C molecules by photosynthesis. During the plant respiration, bound C molecules are breakdown and the monomeric units are transferred to the mineral soil as rhizodeposits and release CO 2 into the atmosphere. Therefore, soil acts as source and sink for C in the terrestrial ecosystem. Soils account for the second largest C flux after the gross primary productivity and release 94.3 Pg C year -1 through soil respiration (Xu and Shang, 2016). These C fluxes in the terrestrial ecosystem balance the global C cycle.",

Two-thirds of the terrestrial C in forest ecosystems is stored in the soils (Dixon et al., 1994) and others are in above-and below-ground biomass and litter (Zipper et al., 2011). The loss of forest cover due to open strip mining activities significantly increases the C level in the atmosphere (Mukhopadhyay and Maiti, 2014). There are two potential measures to balance global C cycle; either cut the emission rate of CO 2 and/or to develop natural C sink that can offset the increasing level of CO 2 . Increasing forest area can be a sustainable tool to mitigate elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration (IPCC, 2001). Thus, it is important to reclaim mine degraded lands to enlarge natural C sink and simultaneously reduce the increasing atmospheric CO 2 level. Intensive use of open strip mining methods to excavate coal reserved under the forest land results in deforestation, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem degradation. In India, N90% of the coal has been mined through open strip mining methods thus massive degradation of forest land is inevitable (Ghose, 2001;Maiti, 2012). During open strip mining, topsoil overlaying coal seam is scraped out and stored properly for further use. The subsoil material and overlaying rocks (overburden; OB) are dumped adjacent to the quarry area (i.e. external dumps) until lower most coal seam is decoaled. Once these dumps are inactive, meaning that no more overburden will be placed on themthey are stabilized by contouring and benching. As mining progresses and the area is decoaled, internal dumping of the OB materials continues, resulting in the creation of several rows of spoil piles in the mine void. Grading of these piles is done by bulldozers to create an approved post-mining topography. This operation is commonly known as \"backfilling\" (internal dumping).",

In regard to regrading, redistribution of topsoil, and runoff management, developing a forested area as the post-mining land use is much easier to accomplish on these backfilled areas than on external dumps. These OB materials are largely comprised of unaltered spoil materials that may have low soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient pool (Ussiri and Lal, 2005;Chatterjee et al., 2009) and may differ in a stoichiometric ratio of soil nutrients (N, P, K) from undisturbed soils (Pietrzykowski et al., 2013). In the process of reclamation, OB materials are leveled and blanketed with topsoil, however, top-soiling is not usually practiced in India. Thereafter, fast growing tree plantation on backfilled dumps were practiced with or without application of topsoil and soil amendments. Although not all the tree species are able to develop in a harassed mining environment, selection of target species (species that can tolerate a wide range of climatic conditions such as drought, temperature, and nutrient poor condition) is important for reclamation. The ability of tree species to grow under poor nutrient condition and accumulate high biomass is suitable for mine reclamation (Singh et al., 2006;Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013;Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014). At the same time, the recovery of natural vegetation is often overlooked. Establishment of natural vegetation on the mine degraded lands through succession and the recuperation of soil quality similar to natural forest may extend over a long time (50-100 years) likely due to lack of substrate and adverse soil conditions for plant growth (Bradshaw, 1997). However, it may be shortened by the anthropogenic intervention such as reclamation/restoration of degraded sites.",

Soil CO 2 pool is larger than atmosphere and vegetation, therefore, to study a change in soil CO 2 flux is of prime importance to implement climate change strategies (Song et al., 2013). Reclaimed site has a large potential to sequester atmospheric C that may be varied with the climatic conditions and plant species use for reclamation (Lal, 2005;Pietrzykowski and Daniels, 2014). The development of vegetation cover and soil properties on reclaimed sites can sequester more atmospheric CO 2 with an increase in the age of reclamation (Amichev et al., 2008). The root and microbial respiration in contrary, results in emission of CO 2 from soil surface into the atmosphere (Kutsch et al., 2009). Soil respiration is the main source of CO 2 released from the soil and it varies with the climatic conditions, ecosystem type and SOC concentration (Rastogi et al., 2002;Vodnik et al., 2009;Ota and Yamazawa, 2010). Thus, RMS acts both as a sink and source of CO 2 . Since the last decade, reconstruction of mine degraded lands has been receiving great attention due to its possible role in combating global warming (Shrestha and Lal, 2006;Mukhopadhyay and Maiti, 2014;Tripathi et al., 2014).

Accretion of nutrient stocks in mine soil plays an essential role in the development of soil horizons and plant growth during the early stages of reclamation or natural succession (Maiti, 2012). In this process, accretion of soil organic matter (SOM) is of prime importance (Frouz et al., 2001;Frouz et al., 2015) because it bounds SOC and N, which may later on mineralize and enhance the mine soil fertility. Besides SOM, plant biomass, stand age and fine earth fractions are the factors affecting nutrient stock and C sequestration in the post-mining reclaimed land (Singh et al., 2006;Zipper et al., 2011;Das and Maiti, 2016b). Due to rapid increase in land use changes in mining activity (forest to non-forest land) it is axiomatic to quantify the changes in plant biomass, C and nutrient pool to build up restoration strategies for sustainable mining. The objectives of the current study were to (i) measure changes in soil properties, SOC and N stocks over reclaimed chronosequence, and (ii) quantify the ecosystem C pool and soil CO 2 flux of reclaimed sites.

The results showed that, with rising stand age, the carbon density of both overstory tree and humus layers increased, the carbon density of the understory vegetation layer (shrubs and herbs) decreased, and the carbon density of soil layer (0-100 cm) first increased and then slightly decreased. However, the total ecosystem carbon density increased with rising stand age. With rising tree density and canopy density, the overstory carbon density increased, up to the thresholds of about 1800 trees/ha and 0.7 respectively, but after that increased very slowly; while the understory vegetation carbon density decreased continuously with rising tree density, but decreased with rising canopy density, first very slowly up to the range of 0.6-0.7 and after that very quickly. With rising overstory tree biomass, the humus layer carbon density increased, while soil layer carbon density first increased to a certain threshold, then leveled off or slowly decreased. With rising canopy density, the humus and soil carbon density first increased to the threshold of 0.7 and 0.67, respectively, then decreased. Therefore, the optimum canopy density of 0.7 maintains the highest total ecosystem carbon density with its highest or relatively higher components.

Forest ecosystems account for about 70% of current terrestrial carbon sink (Dixon et al., 1994;Wolf et al., 2011), play an essential role in the exchange of carbon between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere, and have a high potential for sequestering atmospheric carbon, thus controlling future effects of global warming (Gower, 2003;Houghton, 2005;Li et al., 2013;Ahmad et al., 2015). Suggested operational measures to mitigate the global climate change include enhancing carbon sequestration by increasing plantation forest area and elevating the carbon density by improving forest ecosystem quality and related services (Watson et al., 2000;Peichl and Arain, 2006). Initially, China had implemented the Grain for Green Program (GGP) nationwide since 1999 to convert the slope croplands to forest land or grassland, with the primary purposes of restoring degraded environment (e.g., severe soil erosion) and enhancing the soil-and water-related ecosystem services (Chang et al., 2011). This program contributed to the increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, especially forest ecosystems (Zhang et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2017). In the last two decades, the carbon sequestration service of forest ecosystems in China considerably increased (Zhang and Xu, 2003), i.e., plantation forests contributed about 80% of the increment in the total forest carbon sink (Fang et al., 2007). The plantation area in China accounted for 36% of the total forest area (69.33 million ha) in 2013 (Justine et al., 2015).",

Although many studies highlight the high potential for carbon sequestration in overstory tree biomass (Son et al., 2001;Peichl and Arain, 2006), there have been shortfalls in not accounting for the carbon sequestered by all individual carbon components of forest ecosystem, including the functional layers of the overstory tree layer, understory vegetation layer, humus layer, and mineral soil layer where the carbon accumulation potential is very high (Noh et al., 2010), especially for the plantations of some tree species like larch. Every carbon component (or functional layer) plays a specific role in supplying certain functions/ services (such as timber production, erosion control, water regulation, plant diversity protection, natural regeneration of trees, carbon sequestration, etc.). Thus, maintaining a relatively higher (not necessarily the highest) total carbon density based on a tradeoff approach for balancing all the main carbon components is required for optimal forest management. The carbon components in forests vary with changing stand structure and age (Li et al., 2013). An easy way to quantify stand structure and associated varying carbon components in forests is ongoing investigation or inventory at specific intervals of stand age, although there are several limitations under specific climatic and environmental conditions (Li et al., 2013). Many studies have shown the importance of stand age, tree density, and canopy density (along with site factors) in explaining the vegetation biomass and carbon density in forest ecosystems (Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 1998;King et al., 2006;Uri et al., 2012;Cheng et al., 2013;Li et al., 2014a;Wang et al., 2015b).

We conducted a global meta-analysis to compare soil physical, chemical, and biological properties between restoring forests and reference old-growth/less-disturbed forests. We revealed for the first time that differences between restoring and reference forests are lower for physical (12-25%; based on median values of effect size) and chemical (10-74%) properties than for biological (32-90%) properties. More specifically, bulk density (12% of difference), pH (10%), and enzyme activity (32%) had mean values in restoring forests closer to those observed in reference forests. Overall, our results suggest that the restoration of soil properties was greater in tropical regions, after longer periods (>30 years), through passive restoration, and over pasturelands.

For instance, loss of soil fertility results in decreased agricultural productivity, which may cause food insecurity, malnutrition and hunger (Lal 2004). It is therefore imperative to recover soil quality not only to mitigate soil degradation but also to ensure the socioenvironmental benefits of soil into the future (Lal 2015). Soil quality is the \"continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living system, within ecosystem and land use boundaries, to sustain biological productivity, to promote the quality of air and water environments, and to maintain plant, animal and human health\" (Doran & Safley 1997). To assess soil quality, it is necessary to use indicators-measurable properties that help assess the effects of management on soil functioning (Doran et al. 1996).

Even though several studies and global metaanalyses of forest restoration have included soil data, the impacts of forest restoration on recovering the physical, chemical, and biological quality of soil remain under-investigated (Latawiec et al. 2016;Meli et al. 2017;Mendes et al. 2018). Here we aim to address a key knowledge gap: how does restoration of forest ecosystems affect recovery of soil quality? Specifically, our questions are: (1) To what extent are soil physical, chemical, and biological quality recovered in restoring forests? (2) Which physical, chemical, and biological properties differ less between restoring and reference forests? (3) How does the recovery of soil quality in restoring forests vary as a function of the (i) forest region (tropical or temperate), (ii) restoration strategy (active vs. passive), (iii) past disturbance, (iv) soil class, and (v) time since restoration started? (Fig. 1). To answer these questions, we conducted a global meta-analysis comparing soil properties between restoring and reference (old-growth/ less-disturbed) forests. Our findings help fill the soil information gap in forest restoration and increase our understanding of how to improve both soil quality and soil monitoring processes.",
        "4ebb3134-54d7-4555-a16c-7bb6914d947e": "Our global meta-analysis for tropical and temperate regions revealed that soil physical and chemical properties, compared with biological properties, have values in restoring forests closer to those found in reference forests. This pattern is consistent across different forest regions, restoration strategies, past disturbances, and soil classes. We also show that the recovery of soil properties was greater in tropical regions, after longer periods (>30 years), through passive restoration, and over pasturelands. Our global meta-analysis helps to fill the soil information gap in forest restoration and increase our understanding of how to improve soil quality through forest restoration and soil monitoring processes in tropical and temperate regions. To What Extent Are Soil Physical, Chemical, and Biological Quality Recovered in Restoring Forests? Forest restoration had more positive effects on the recovery of physical and chemical properties than on the recovery of soil biological properties. These results were already expected because soil physical and chemical properties, in general, only alter through very drastic changes (Filip 2002). Furthermore, even when impacted, physical properties tend to present greater recovery because as vegetation becomes established, soil structure improves due to organic matter inputs, reduction of bulk density and increase in soil porosity (Engel & Parrotta 2001;Siddique et al. 2008). These organic matter inputs also influence nutrient levels, contributing to soil fertility and to the greater recovery of chemical properties as well (Murphy 2015;Rashid et al. 2016;Novak et al. 2019). The recovery of physical and chemical properties could be also due to their strong interaction with each other. Soil organic matter, for instance, is positively correlated with both soil texture and pH (Burke et al. 1990;Campbell et al. 1996). Due to slower decomposition of organic matter, soils with high clay content may have higher soil organic matter content (Xie & Steinberger 2001). In addition, soil organic matter stabilizes soil pH, a chemical property involved in the supply and uptake of nutrients by vegetation (Campbell et al. 1996).",
        "2a48e4d5-f6df-42c0-ba54-7a982040f410": "1996). Thus, even analyzing soil properties separately here, the recovery of physical and chemical properties could be related and leading to their greater recovery. Future studies should pull more information and analyze these properties independently or develop experimental studies to do it. On the other hand, differences in biological properties were larger between the restored and reference forests. This result confirms that soil biological properties are more sensitive to environmental changes (Pankhurst et al. 1995;Bastida et al. 2008). These properties are the first to be affected by soil degradation since the loss of habitat quality directly affects the life of microorganisms present in the soil (Escobar 2013). Also, these properties are usually the ones that need the most time to recover. Enzyme activity, for example, increases as vegetation grows and as total amounts of soil carbon increase (Udawatta et al. 2009). Thus more time is needed for this property to be recovered. Furthermore, the recovery of biological properties largely depends on the recovery of physical and chemical properties. When restoring forest ecosystems, tree species, organic matter input, nutrients, C:N ratio, and soil pH can be factors that determine the growth, size, composition, and activity of soil microorganisms as well as restoration techniques (Smith et al. 2015;Khan et al. 2019). Which Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties Differ Less Between Restoring and Reference Forests? We showed that bulk density, soil pH, and enzymatic activity are the soil properties that have values in restoring forests closer to those found in reference forests for physical, chemical, and biological properties, respectively. The recovery of bulk density is often associated with the reduction of soil compaction caused by the increasing number of roots and organic matter deposition (Engel & Parrotta 2001;Siddique et al. 2008;Gageler et al. 2014). The recovery of soil pH is observed as forest restoration takes place, soil organic matter deposits increase, leading to an increase in humus.",
        "f3b92666-118c-4a8d-b858-e95a1806ebe4": "Humic acids play a buffering role for soil pH and thus are likely to be associated with recovery of well-functioning soil pH (Booth et al. 2005;Binkley & Fisher 2013;Hong et al. 2018). The recovery of enzymatic activity in soil increases with forest restoration as plant roots generate exudates that are rich in substrates acted on by enzymes (Egamberdieva et al. 2011) (Doran & Parkin 1994;Doran et al. 1996). How Does the Recovery of Soil Quality in Restoring Forests Vary as a Function of Environmental Factors? We found, in overall, greater recovery of soil properties in restoring compared with reference forests for tropical than temperate regions. Even though temperate soils are younger, more fertile and have higher structural resistance to disturbance (Robertson & Grandy 2006), soils from tropical regions are characterized by rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Malhi et al. 1999;SSSA 2019). Only physical properties showed greater recovery in temperate regions. However, this result was expected as physical properties of soil in the tropical regions tend to have lower bulk density, higher water content, and higher hydraulic conductivity when compared with soil of temperate regions (Minasny & Hartemink 2011). Previous studies have shown that soil recovery following unassisted natural regeneration is slow due to the low vegetation establishment, while active restoration shows greater recovery of soil quality in the short term (Roa-Fuentes et al. 2013). For example, physical properties have greater recovery with active management because this restoration strategy often includes additional soil amendments (ash, rice hush, litter, biochar, etc.) to increase plant survival and growth (St\u00fcrmer & Siqueira 2010;Thomas & Gale 2015;Werden et al. 2017). The application of soil amendments is a common practice used to improve soil physical properties (texture and structure), contributing to better conditions for water storage and increasing the macro-aggregate stability (Liang et al. 2011;Carmeis Filho et al.",
        "608003f0-e9e2-4f93-939b-eae02498a542": "2011;Carmeis Filho et al. 2016;Mart\u00ednez et al. 2018). We found, however, the opposite for recovery of chemical and biological properties. In the short term, passive restoration favors the recovery of carbon and nitrogen content in soil pools (Roa-Fuentes et al. 2013). We then show that, although active restoration strategies are often considered as the best to accelerate recovery of forests and soil quality, passive restoration outcomes can be as good as active planting for the recovery of chemical and biological properties (Tiessen et al. 1994;Griscom et al. 2005;Roa-Fuentes et al. 2013). When comparing past disturbance types (i.e. agriculture vs. pasture), we found greater recovery of soil quality in areas previously used as pasturelands. Intensive agricultural practices, such as tillage and harrowing may contribute to physical loss of soil and impoverishment of nutrient pools, altering soil microbiological populations and reducing levels of organic matter (Mohammadi et al. 2012;Heidari et al. 2016;Krauss et al. 2020). This land use practice can have a long term legacy (Roldan et al. 1997), consequently impacting forest restoration (Maloney et al. 2008;Jakovac et al. 2015) and soil quality recovery (Meli et al. 2017). Tropical countries such as India and Brazil occupy the positions of the most mechanized countries in the world (WorldBank 2022). In the case of Brazil, the agricultural sector has moved from a traditional production system with low use of modern technologies to a world agricultural leader, mainly in the last four decades (Rada & Valdes 2012;Mantovani et al. 2019).",
        "34f206b8-bd5d-40be-af9d-ab3b830bd0fd": "2019). On the other hand, pasturelands usually do not employ machinery to interfere as much in soil structure, also have higher levels of microbial biomass and animal-derived organic matter when compared to other production systems, which benefits the soil microbiota and is key for the restoration of the structure and functionality of degraded soils (Mello & Marchiori 1999;Oliveira et al. 2001;Toda et al. 2010). Soil classes with values in restoring forests closer to those found in reference forests were: Ferralsols for physical properties, Cambisols and Ferralsols for chemical properties, and Acrisols for biological properties. Ferralsols have solid microstructure due to the high amounts of aluminum and iron, and well-developed sand-sized and silt-sized micro-aggregates, which explain why physical properties were greater in this soil class (van den Berg et al. 1997;Minasny & Hartemink 2011;Strey et al. 2016). Our results for chemical properties in Cambisols can be explained as this class of soil has high resilience to reduction in fertility (Hartemik & Bridges 1995). On the other hand, Ferralsols are chemically poor soils but they are often well aggregated and thus have stable structure and soil aggregate stability, which can indicate resistance to erosion (Madari et al. 2005;Nichols & Toro 2011;Musinguzi et al. 2015). For biological properties, Acrisols showed greater values in restoring forests as they are less weathered, contain lower clay content, and have sandy-loam texture (Strey et al. 2016), while Ferralsols, for example, are heavily weathered soils where the recovery of biological properties may takes longer (Klamt & van Reeuwijk 2000). Restoration age has already been recognized as one of the main drivers of forest restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation cover (Crouzeilles et al. 2016b). Here, we found that the older the forest restoration, the greater is the recovery of soil quality.",

We showed that soil carbon content increases with restoration age which agrees with previous studies demonstrating that soil carbon stocks tend to recover relatively quickly after disturbance (Martin et al. 2014;Shao et al. 2019). For soil recovery, it is also reported that soil quality improves with the age of planting (active restoration) (Bhojvaid & Timmer 1998;Paul et al. 2010). As forest cover is established through various successional stages, there are inputs of organic matter, which directly affects the soil's physical, chemical and biological properties (Zhu et al. 2010;Braida et al. 2011;Xu et al. 2018). As there are many parts of the world missing or low in sample size such as Africa and Australia, our results apply mostly to the sampled areas and should not be extrapolated to any other tropical or temperate areas around the globe without the proper caution. In addition, as highlighted in the manuscript and aligned with the current literature, the response variables that are not frequently measured in the literature are the biological ones, such as earthworms, microbial biomass, and soil respiration. These variables may require specific knowledge from those who use them and this may be the reason why these are less used, despite their high responsiveness (B\u00fcnemann et al. 2018). Given the importance of soil biological properties and its central role in soil analysis and monitoring, further studies could focus on comparing the soil composition between restoring and reference sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to examine global patterns in recovery of soil quality through forest restoration. We revealed that soil physical and chemical properties have values in restoring forests closer to those found in reference forests when compared with biological properties; independently of forest regions, restoration strategies, past disturbances, and soil class. Despite our findings, it is still early to identify conclusive patterns since few soil data are available among restoration studies, especially biological indicators (Knoepp et al. 2000;Izquierdo et al.",

        "c6074ae3-2a27-4f1d-bfac-f790e543d332": "Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. They are highly productive ecosystems with rates of primary production equal to those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. Although mangroves occupy only 0.5% of the global coastal area, they contribute 10-15% (24 Tg C y -1 ) to coastal sediment carbon storage and export 10-11% of the particulate terrestrial carbon to the ocean. Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y -1 ) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage. Large reservoirs of dissolved inorganic carbon in deep soils, pumped via subsurface pathways to adjacent waterways, are a large loss of carbon, at a potential rate up to 40% of annual primary production. Patterns of carbon allocation and rates of carbon flux in mangrove forests are nearly identical to those of other tropical forests.",
        "3143b89a-00ca-47b2-a36e-c9cf25fbb616": "Mangroves are the only woody plants occupying the margin between land and sea in low latitudes. First appearing on the shores of the Tethys Sea, mangroves diverged from terrestrial relatives during the Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary (Ricklefs et al. 2006). Today, approximately 70 genetically diverse species constitute the mangrove flora (Spaulding et al. 2010). These tidal forests inhabit approximately 138,000 km 2 (Giri et al. 2010) of mostly sheltered subtropical and tropical coastlines, and are disappearing at an alarming rate and facing an uncertain future (Polidoro et al. 2010, Van Lavieren et al. 2012). Structurally simple compared with terrestrial forests, mangrove forests harbor few tree species and usually lack an understory, but they are functionally complex, having ecosystem attributes analogous to those of other forests but also functioning like other estuarine and marine ecosystems in myriad ways (Feller et al. 2010). The biomass of mangrove forests peaks at equatorial latitudes. Their global mean biomass [247 tonnes per hectare (t ha -1 )] equals the global average biomass of tropical humid evergreen forests (Alongi 2009, Camacho et al. 2011, Donato et al. 2012). Drivers such as salinity, geomorphology, and tidal regime impose structural and functional constraints and foster adaptations (e.g., aerial roots, viviparous embryos, and efficient nutrient-retention mechanisms) as well as physiological mechanisms to help mangroves subsist in waterlogged saline soils. Most mangrove carbon is stored in soil and sizable belowground pools of dead roots (Alongi et al. 2003(Alongi et al. , 2004b)), which helps to conserve and recycle nutrients beneath the forest.",

Tides and (to a lesser extent) waves constitute an auxiliary energy subsidy that allows mangrove forests to store and transport new fixed carbon, sediments, food, and nutrients and to do the work of exporting wastes, heat, and refractory compounds to the atmosphere and adjacent coastal waters (Vo-Luong & Massel 2008, Barr et al. 2013). Organisms that make use of this subsidized energy can shunt more of their own energy to growth and reproduction, thus making tides one of the primary drivers structuring and regulating mangrove ecosystems (Wolanski et al. 1992). Forest food webs are composed of a mixture of arboreal and soil fauna and flora that actively cycle carbon (Scharler 2011, Sousa & Dangremond 2011). Equally productive are highly diverse plankton communities that are well adapted to the complex chemistry and physics of opaque tidal waters. Mangrove creeks and waterways are important habitats for estuarine and marine organisms ranging in size from viruses to crocodiles. Tidal circulation is highly complex, as forest topography and morphology and the tidal prism control the extent of mixing and trapping of water and suspended matter within the forest and adjacent waterways (Wolanski et al. 1992). These phenomena are responsible for the tendency of most, but not all, mangroves to passively and actively accumulate sediments (Wolanski 1995). Mangroves are increasingly seen as carbon-rich ecosystems that warrant preservation and restoration (Van Lavieren et al. 2012), not so much because they are ecologically and economically important as because they are perceived as able to play a role in climate regulation, capturing and preserving significant amounts of carbon to help counterbalance anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (Mcleod et al. 2011, Siikam\u00e4ki et al. 2012).",

Here, I review what is known about carbon cycling in mangroves, especially their capacity to capture and store carbon, as well as aspects of these processes that are not fully understood but may nevertheless provide new insights into the fate of mangrove carbon.",

Methods: We selected ten dominant land-use types in a hilly area of western Hanoi including bare soil, agriculture (cassava or lemon grass), shrub land, five types of plantation forest, and indigenous forest. We measured the understory biomass, litter biomass, canopy openness, soil moisture content, soil pedestal height, soil hardness, soil bulk density, 137 Cs and 210 Pb ex activities, and soil carbon and nitrogen on three 1 m 2 plots for each land-use type. Soil erosion was calculated from both pedestal heights and radionuclides. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify the key factors controlling soil erosion and nutrient accumulations. Results: Understory biomass ranged from 2 to 375 g m -2 , and this tended to be higher in most of the forest types and shrubland than in cassava and lemon grass. In contrast, the amount of ground cover varied more by forest type than between the agricultural land uses and forest lands. The height of soil pedestals indicated that shortterm soil erosion was negligible when understory biomass was greater than 130 to 150 g m -2 . 137 Cs was only detected in the cassava plots, whereas 210 Pb ex indicated widely different erosion rates across the land uses, with lower values in the agricultural lands and two types of forest plantations, although this may be due to soil management practices. Both the correlation and principal component analyses showed that soil organic carbon and nitrogen were positively correlated to understory biomass and strongly and inversely influenced by bulk density. Soil erosion as indicated by soil pedestal height was strongly and inversely controlled by ground cover, litter, and understory biomass. Soil erosion was also heavily influential to soil chemical richness and bulk density. Conclusions: Ground vegetation cover and the resultant soil erosion processes altered the production and accumulation of SOC, while forest cover did not always result in high soil fertility or low erosion.",

Twenty-three percent of the Earth's land surface has been severely affected by soil erosion, with an estimated 5-10 million ha being affected each year (Stavi and Lal, in press). Asia historically has had the highest percentage of degraded land at 31%, followed by Africa at 27% (Oldemal, 1994). The high proportion of degraded land in Asia is due to both rapid population growth and the associated land-use changes, combined with inadequate land-use planning and regulations to control soil erosion (Lal, 2004;Phan Ha et al., 2012;Quynh et al., 2005). Soil erosion reduces soil productivity by decreasing soil macronutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and soil moisture storage capacity (Kuhn et al., 2009;Takenaka et al., 1998;Teramage et al., 2013). Soil erosion was reported to be the main mechanism for nutrient loss in areas devoted to growing cassava in the north central coastal region of Vietnam (Andersson, 2002;Maglinao et al., 2002;Podwojewski et al., 2008). In northern Vietnam, soil loss varies greatly with land use and location. The total soil loss in a 250-ha watershed covered by agricultural and forested land ranged from 16.3 to 172.2 g m -2 year -1 in Vinh Phuc province (Mai et al., 2013). Soil losses of 14 to 150 g m -2 year -1 were reported from Hoa Binh province (Phan Ha et al., 2012).",
        "19975925-a5ef-4ebb-8f8a-defe6a099bfb": "Other studies reported soil losses of up to 1305 g m -2 year -1 in Hoa Binh province (Podwojewski et al., 2008) and up to 17,000 g m -2 year -1 for maize fields in Son La province (Tuan et al., 2014). These high soil loss rates will decrease land productivity, increase the need for chemical fertilizers, and contribute to regional biodiversity loss (Lal, 1998). High soil loss rates also can induce socioeconomic problems, including lower household incomes, food insecurity, and regional poverty (Ananda and Herath, 2003;Oldemal, 1994). Sediment delivery to streams and rivers can cause flooding and reservoir sedimentation as well as negative effects on water quality and aquatic resources (Chappell et al., 2004;Gomi et al., 2006). Surface cover by litter or live vegetation is one of the important parameters controlling infiltration, surface runoff and erosion, and macronutrient levels (i.e., Nanko et al., 2008). Infiltration capacity generally increases with increasing density of understory vegetation (Hiraoka and Onda, 2012). The loss of ground cover due to deforestation, agriculture, over-grazing, and fires can lead to the formation of a soil crust, which results in increased overland flow and surface erosion (Larsen et al., 2009;Singer and Le Bissonnais, 1998). The presence of litter and understory vegetation also increases flow resistance, thereby reducing overland flow velocities (Tabacchi et al., 2000). In addition to providing litter and protecting the soil from erosion, understory vegetation also contributes to forest ecosystems through nutrient and carbon turnover during decomposition (Teramage et al., 2013) and facilitates increased rates of biogeochemical cycling (Yarie, 1980). Monitoring erosion and macronutrient levels is difficult, particularly in rural areas of developing countries like Vietnam, because of the cost for regular sampling and the long time period needed to detect trends.",

Short-term erosion can be estimated by measuring soil pedestal heights (Okoba and Sterk, 2006;Sidle et al., 2004;Stocking and Murnaghan, 2001). A soil pedestal is a column of soil that is above an eroded surface because a rock or other object protected the underlying soil from rainsplash erosion. The difference in height between the top of the pedestal and the adjacent soil surface can be used to estimate storm or seasonal erosion rates (Sidle et al., 2004). Erosion rates over a few decades can be estimated by studying the distribution of radionuclides in the soil, particularly 137 Cs and 210 Pb ex (Navas et al., 2012;Walling and He, 1999). Both 210 Pb ex and 137 Cs are deposited from the atmosphere, and these radionuclides are rapidly adsorbed by organic matter and mineral topsoil. The distribution of 210 Pb ex with depth will reflect the erosion and deposition of soil. Similarly, the global fallout of 137 Cs provides a unique marker for evaluating soil erosion because deposition peaked in 1963 and then ceased. Comparisons of 137 Cs and 210 Pb ex between sites with similar soils but different land uses can therefore indicate how land use affects longerterm erosion rates (Li and Nguyen, 2010). Although vegetation and litter cover are important controls on soil erosion and nutrient accumulation, interactions among vegetation, soil erosion, and macronutrient levels have rarely been investigated. Most previous studies have focused on the relationships between vegetation cover and soil erosion (Miyata et al., 2009;Mohammad and Adam, 2010;Zhou et al., 2008), or soil nutrient levels in relation to soil erosion (Kinderiene and Karcauskiene, 2012;Stolte et al., 2009), or between vegetation cover and soil nutrient levels (Fierer and Gabet, 2002;Yarie, 1980).",

An understanding of these factors and their interactions for different land uses is important for sustaining short-and long-term ecosystem productivity (Angers and Caron, 1998;Lal, 2004;Schlesinger, 1990). The alternative to long-term and much expensive studies is to measure a more comprehensive suite of physical, chemical, and biological parameters across different land uses and then to apply multivariate analysis techniques. None of the previously-cited studies of soil erosion in northern Vietnam have provided this more comprehensive assessment of site factors and attempted to then analyze the various relationships among land use, vegetation, soil chemical and physical properties, and erosion. Here, we hypothesize a strong linkage among soil nutrients, land use, and soil erosion in northern Vietnam, and that a simple characterization of land use may not be adequate to characterize soil nutrient status and erosion rates. Hence the objectives of this study were to: 1) characterize the vegetation and litter cover, soil physical properties, and nutrient levels in replicated plots with different land uses in northern Vietnam; 2) assess short-and long-term soil erosion using soil pedestals and radionuclides; and 3) evaluate the relationships and potential feedbacks between land use, macronutrient levels, physical soil properties, the amount of vegetation and litter, and soil erosion.",

However, native species reforestations often present a bias toward fast growth, low wood density, and small maximum adult size species, contrasting with most mature forest species. Since tree species adult size and wood density are key traits that influence biomass accumulation, these induce uncertainty regarding carbon uptake capabilities of restoration projects in the long term. We compared the density of individuals (DI), basal area (BA), aboveground biomass (AGB), and weighted average wood density (WDW) in 13-14-year-old restoration sites and in mature seasonal Atlantic Forest fragments. We also assessed the contribution of pioneer and non-pioneer and planted and non-planted species on these variables at restoration sites. Furthermore, we investigated the DI and WDW for saplings and seedlings, in order to foresee changes in forest structure that may result from natural recruitment of dense-wood mature species. The BA and WDW at restoration sites were similar to forest fragments, except for large trees (DBH \u226550 cm). Restoration sites recovered AGB to the level of forest fragments only for the smaller size class (DBH 5-19.9 cm). Planted pioneer and non-pioneer species accumulated the greatest AGB (93%), BA (94%), and DI (90%) at restoration sites. The DI of non-planted non-pioneer species with higher WDW increased among saplings and seedlings at restoration sites.

Indeed, because of the high abundance of fast-growing pioneer species, both those that are planted (during reforestation) and naturally established, aboveground biomass (hereafter referred to as biomass) accumulates quickly in the first few years of succession (Shimamoto et al. 2014;Rozendaal & Chazdon 2015). Adult trees of fast-growing species accumulate less biomass than slow-growing late-successional species, because of their soft wood and limited adult size; they also have a shorter lifespan than slow-growing, late successional species (Shimamoto et al. 2014;Rozendaal & Chazdon 2015). It is expected that pioneer tree species start to senesce and die 10-20 years after establishment and are replaced by late succession, slow-growing species with a high wood density (WD; Salimon & Brown 2000;Lu et al. 2003;Shimamoto et al. 2014;Rozendaal & Chazdon 2015). Thus, WD is a key trait that affects long-term biomass accumulation in tropical forests (Phillips et al. 2019;Poorter et al. 2019). Species replacement can determine if the rate of biomass increase at restoration sites will be similar to that for regional references, which most likely involves a nonlinear process: a short phase of rapid increase mostly based on the growth of pioneer species, followed by a long period of steady, slow increase, owing to the recruitment of larger trees with harder wood. A direct effect of this process is the dependence of biomass accumulation on both site conditions (e.g. soil fertility) and the amount of remnant forests in the surrounding landscape (Chazdon 2003;Robinson et al. 2015;Suganuma et al. 2017).",

Poor conditions for late succession species establishment, or limited dispersal activities from nearby forest fragments, could lead to stagnated biomass stocks (Brown & Lugo 1990;Salimon & Brown 2000;Lu et al. 2003;Liebsch et al. 2008). However, in some reforestation sites, planting a mix with a higher density of longliving hardwood, and/or large tree species, can lead to biomass stocks greater than those for regional references (Melo & Durigan 2006;Suganuma & Durigan 2015) or can result in arrested species replacement (Oliveira et al. 2019). Nonetheless, despite the relevance of tree size distribution to ecosystem functioning at restoration sites, this has received little attention (Oliveira et al. 2019). Here, we looked at the distribution of tree size classes, tree species density, basal area, biomass, and specific WD in both 13-14-year-old restoration sites and mature Atlantic Forest fragments (reference ecosystem). This was done to answer the following questions: (1) How do restoration sites differ from forest fragments in terms of biomass distribution into tree size classes? (2) What are the relative contributions of tree density and average WD to the differences in aboveground biomass? and (3) What is the relative contribution of naturally recruited non-pioneer, nonplanted species to biomass accumulation at the restoration sites?",

These uncertainties are due to variability in the accumulation and maintenance of the carbon reservoirs of forests in restoration sites in the long term, depending on the recruitment, growth, and increase in the density of long-lifespan tree species (K\u00f6rner 2017). Therefore, understanding the contrast in size classes between restoration sites and reference ecosystems (old-growth forests) can help predict the trajectory of forests under restoration (Oliveira et al. 2019). Here, we found no differences between restoration sites and forest fragments for the DI, basal area, and WDW for most size classes, but the three variables were lower in restoration sites than in forest fragments for large trees (DBH \u226550 cm). Furthermore, the AGB was lower in restoration sites than in forest fragments for midsized and larger trees (DBH 20-34.9, 35-49.9, and \u226550 cm).",

Walker) plantations in the Parkland region in central Alberta, Canada. The NEP across land uses ranged between 0 and 13 Mg C ha -1 year -1 , while changes in C storage over two years (2006)(2007)(2008) ranged between 1 and 7 Mg C ha -1 year -1 as biomass C and between -1 and 6 Mg C ha -1 year -1 as soil organic C. When agricultural land was converted to hybrid poplar plantations, soils under hybrid poplar plantations were initially large sources of C losing a total of 8 Mg C ha -1 . As cultivation ceased and net primary productivity (and thus litter input) increased, the soil started to become a net C sink by year 2, reaching its pre-plantation level by year 7. At the ecosystem level, hybrid poplar plantations were a source of C in the first 2 years, due to the small contribution of plant biomass and litter relative to soil C loss. Thereafter, the ecosystem acted as a net C sink and reached its pre-plantation level by year 4. We conclude that growing hybrid poplars on rotations longer than 4 years in the study area would create a net C sink and converting agricultural land to fast-growing short-rotation woody crops has the potential for mitigating future climate change.",

The magnitude of change in C storage depends on how physical, chemical, or biological processes are altered over time under different land uses (IPCC, 2000). For example, disturbance caused by land clearing that reduces vegetation cover can increase the loss of soil organic matter through erosion and leaching of dissolved organic C. Such conversions also reduce the potentials for biomass C production (Lal, 2003). In North America, approximately 30-50% of soil C that amounts to 30-40 Mg C ha -1 has been lost to the atmosphere and soil organic C (SOC) stocks rapidly declined following conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystems (Lal, 2006). Globally, it has been estimated that changes in land use (from forests to pastures or permanent croplands, and shifting cultivation) released 123 Pg C over the period from 1850 to 1990 (Houghton, 1999), contributing about 18-20% of the total anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 each year (Dumanski, 2004). On the other hand, afforestation, reforestation, restoration of cultivated, abandoned and marginal agricultural lands can potentially reverse the process of C loss and increase ecosystem C storage (Ross et al., 2002). In this respect, the establishment of large-scale short-rotation woody crop plantations has been advocated as an effective method for sequestering CO 2 and mitigating increased atmospheric CO 2 levels (House et al., 2002), through increasing long-term C storage in woody biomass (Schimel et al., 2001) and in the soil (Garten, 2002), and by providing bioenergy (Tuskan and Walsh, 2001).

In particular, it is expected that those plantations would act as a C source during the initial years following establishment due to cultivation (for plantation establishment and weed control) that accelerates short-term decomposition of soil organic matter (Grigal and Berguson, 1998). Therefore, both the rate of C accumulation as well as the turning point when these plantations become a C sink from a C source must be determined. The net balance of C of different processes can be assessed by net ecosystem productivity (NEP) (Randerson et al., 2002), which is the difference between net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (R h ) from the soil. In addition, the estimation of the sequestration potential of each C pool (e.g., vegetation vs. soil) is important in understanding the dynamics of terrestrial C sinks. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the changes in ecosystem C production and storage when a previously agricultural land was converted to hybrid poplar plantations, and (ii) to examine the dynamics of C source-sink relationships in the developing plantation systems to determine the turning point when these plantations become a C sink from a C source.",

Total carbon stock of the forest is estimated to be 2,250.24 tons with average carbon stock of 166.68 tons/ha. Total carbon stock per hectare was found to be higher in the pine-dominated forest as compared to mixed forest due to the larger tree biomass although the litter carbon and soil organic carbon estimates are higher in the latter.

Carbon is exchanged naturally between these systems and the atmosphere through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and burning. Forests capture and retain a large amount of carbon over a long period. About 31 % of the earth's land surface is covered by forest which is estimated to hold a total carbon content of 289 Gt in biomass (FAO 2010), more than the amount of carbon in the entire atmosphere. Carbon stocks are dynamic in forests and are largely affected by land-use changes, soil erosion and deforestation (IPCC 2000). Global reduction of forest areas resulted in annual loss of 0.5 Gt of carbon stocks in forest biomass between 2005and 2010(FAO 2010)). Deforestation contributed about 5.8 GtCO 2 /year to global greenhouse gas emissions in 1990s (Karousakis 2007). Preventing deforestation is thus a globally recognized mitigation measure to reduce climate change in the short term (IPCC 2007) and is gaining the attention of scientific communities, and carbon negotiation mechanisms including REDD (reduced emission from deforestation and forest degradation) and REDD ? (including forest enhancement and sustainable management) which are now under consideration. Nepal is one of the pioneer countries in developing and promoting Community Forest (CF) programs (Paudyal et al. 2006;Pandit et al. 2009), in which the forests are handed over to Community Forest Users Groups (CFUGs). This management scheme represents a paradigm shift in the forestry sector of Nepal reflecting devolution of control of forest resources from state to communities (Karky and Skutsch 2010). Over 1.6 M ha of national forest has been handed over to 17,685 (CFUGs) (DOF 2012) throughout the country, most of which is in the Mid-hills.

Even though are some debates about the outcomes of CF in Terai (in the southern plain of Nepal), CF has revived several degraded forests in the Mid-hills (Dahal and Banskota 2009). The carbon storage potential of forests is being widely investigated and discussed globally after the introduction of the REDD ? mechanism. Because CF is considered a successful forest management program in Nepal, the government and forestryrelated non-governmental organizations are interested in including community forestry programs in the REDD ? mechanism. Among other considerations, this requires estimation of the forest carbon stock in community forests. Such estimation is relatively new to Nepal (Shrestha and Singh 2008), and has recently attracted researchers. Estimation of carbon stock creates carbon trading potential of CF and helps CFUGs to realize the importance of CF in regulating global climate which ultimately motivates users towards better forest conservation. Carbon stock estimation is strongly desirable in both mixed stand and monoculture plantations and warrants promotion by the community forestry program of Nepal. A study from Garhwal Himalaya in India has shown that conifer-dominated forest types have higher carbon storage than broadleafdominated forests (Sharma et al. 2010). In this context, this study aims to assess the potential of CF for carbon storage and to compare carbon stocks between mixed forest and pine-dominated stands within Gwalindaha Community Forest in Badikhel Village Development Committee (VDC) of Lalitpur district in Central Nepal.

This is because it provides information on productivity and sustainability of forest, amount of carbon to be stored in a species and emitted from species due to deforestation. Area exclosures are formerly degraded communal grazing lands that are limited from the interference of human and animals through strong fencing the area by locally available materials with the aim of encouraging natural regeneration (Mekuria and Aynekulu 2013;Demel Teketay et al. 2018). Aboveground biomass includes all woody stems, branches, and leaves of living trees, creepers, and climbers (Genene Assefa et al. 2013).

In estimating aboveground biomass through using allometeric equation woody basic density, height, DBH (Diameter at Breast Height), and DSH (Diameter at Stump Height) were widely used variables. Because these traits were varying among species, forest types, age, and soil fertility (Chave et al. 2005),the level of aboveground biomass carbon stock in species depends on the species type, ages of land use, site, allometeric equation used, and agroecology (Henry et al. 2009;Chave et al. 2005).

In addition, we investigated the changes of SOC stocks after interventions to recover vegetation cover; these were eucalyptus plantations and an exclosure to prevent grazing. Total SOC varied between land use systems and ranged from 3.1 kg C m -2 in croplands to 23.9 kg C m -2 in natural forest, and average N stock ranged from 0.4 kg N m -2 in croplands to 2.1 kg N m -2 in natural forest.

The size of the pool of soil organic carbon (SOC) is determined by the input of plant-derived carbon, the potential to sequester carbon through physical and bio-chemical processes, and the loss of SOC through heterotrophic respiration, leaching, and erosion (De Deyn et al., 2008;Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2000).

The most important human effect on the rate of changes in SOC stock is attributed to LUC (Don et al., 2011;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Houghton and Goodale, 2004), and LUC is a significant factor in global emissions of CO 2 (IPCC, 2014). The contribution of LUC to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions have recently been estimated at 1.2 Pg yr -1 , or about 12-15% of total anthropogenic emissions (Deng et al., 2016). Many studies have shown that the conversion of natural vegetation to cropland often leads to a depletion of SOC stocks (Abu-hashim et al., 2016;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Poeplau et al., 2011).

Guo and Gifford (2002) hypothesized that after conversion of forest to croplands, especially in areas with high annual rainfall, topsoil erosion causes a major loss of carbon. Mean annual precipitation in the central highlands of Ethiopia is ca.1600 mm, but can reach up to 2000 mm within the three main rainy months (Awulachew et al., 2009).

This region contains about 10% of national C stocks and produces over 60% of wood-based products in the USA [1,2]. Net C sequestration in southeastern USA exceeds most other regions but is expected to decline in the next few decades, primarily due to forest aging and conversions to urban and non-agrarian development [3,4]. Overall, forest cover has increased dramatically since the 1950s because the environmental conditions are poor for large-scale production of many crops with the exception of hay and pasture, particularly in the upper coastal plain sub-region. Forest cover of this region is comprised of various pine and hardwood species, with a wide range of forest management overlain on past land conversions. Currently, forested land in this region consists of: 68% managed non-industrial forest; 17% industrial forest; 12% public lands; and only about 3% in parks or reserves, not including de-facto reserves such as stream-side buffers and conservation easements [5]. These diverse forest and land use patterns affect both aboveand belowground C. Forest management currently focuses on the highest value products and revenue (e.g., solid lumber and utility poles), followed by pulpwood for paper. Bioenergy chips and pellets are currently only produced from sawmill waste and other residues [6]. However, new forest management initiatives in the region could reduce the C sequestration, such as efforts to restore native pine savanna with fire, which have much longer rotations and lower tree densities [7]. Short rotation woody crops are also being evaluated for bioenergy and pulp production [8][9][10]. These initiatives are only constrained by market conditions, and air and water quality regulations. When these are combined with existing practices, vegetation succession, and mortality will likely lead to dramatic changes in C stocks and fluxes.",
        "db026c93-d425-4c3b-93b8-53a99a99eabc": "Therefore, establishing a reliable C baseline for individual landowners (e.g., federal and state governments, timber companies, NGOs, and private landowners) who desire to sustain the C sequestration, and to identify opportunities to mitigate land management impacts is important, especially under recent initiatives and potential future policy mandates [11]. National or regional C assessments, although spatially explicit, are not designed to support individual landowners as they generally lack the spatial resolution and data accessibility required [12]. If baseline conditions can be established, modeling the subsequent impact of management alternatives on C stocks and fluxes can provide some estimate of change, but baseline conditions and model parameterization must be site specific and consider effects on all C cycle components [13,14]. However, insufficient knowledge of the natural variation in C cycle processes, catastrophic mortality, and C responses to silvicultural treatments currently exists to reliably model C dynamics over an entire landscape [15,16]. These challenges suggest that some effort to measure C through inventory and monitoring is required to characterize C cycle components that are either spatially variable or sufficiently dynamic and could therefore violate assumptions in regional inventory or modeling tools. For individual forest landscapes, monitoring can itself be a major challenge because of costs, and most inventories focus on efficient estimates of commercial products. Although inventory methods are evolving and new approaches may help reduce costs and provide additional information on C cycle components at a smaller spatial scale [17], these new approaches are not currently applicable to individual landowners. Understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with establishing a reliable C baseline for landowners will have significant implications for management policies and practices, and for detecting change in C stocks in the future [18]. Carbon baselines become critical if public policies, taxes, or markets cause landowners to convert current land use, change management strategy, or if a major disturbance occurs because these activities can have substantial impacts, either positive or negative, on the C balance.",

Disturbances, such as windthrow, wildfire, and drought, can have similarly negative impacts on the C balance [19,20]. Forest management can have large and immediate impacts or more delayed and subtle impacts on the C balance. For example, clearfelling, thinning, or conversion of high-density plantation to low-density savanna all impose immediate removals of aboveground C stocks; however, these management activities should then be followed by increases in both the aboveand belowground C. Afforestation of agrarian landscapes rapidly increases aboveground biomass that continues to increase through time until thinning or harvest [21]. Indeed, the pace and pattern of the aboveground C increases have been estimated for many forest types in the USA [22]. However, much less is understood about belowground responses and soil C accumulation in response to afforestation Forests 2019, 10, 760 3 of 22 efforts [23,24], although a recent meta-analysis suggests that increases in soil C following afforestation of agrarian sites may not be apparent for 30 years or more [21].

Post-mining reforestation efforts have reached reliable tree survivability and growth; however, it is unclear whether these reforestation efforts also restore the ecological functions associated with the native forest ecosystem. The objectives of this study were to quantify the rate at which certain key ecosystem functions return to the landscape, and to relate the development of those functions to structural attributes of the ecosystem. A chronosequence of four reclaimed and reforested stands (ages 5, 11, 21 and 30 years) and unmined reference stands representing pre-mining conditions, were identified on the Appalachian Plateau in southwestern Virginia. Total soil nitrogen (N) and component (mineral soil, forest floor, root, and aboveground biomass) ecosystem carbon (C) pools were quantified.

They sequester and store C, cycle nutrients, provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna, produce wood and non-wood products, provide aesthetic value, improve soil quality, and modulate water quantity and quality, among a myriad of other ecosystem services (FAO 2010;Burger and Zipper 2011;Zipper et al. 2011). Within the temperate deciduous forest biome of the eastern US, the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forest ecoregion reaches from northwest Alabama to southwestern Pennsylvania (Bailey 1983;Omernik 1987). The Appalachian mixed mesophytic forest is among the most biologically diverse temperate forest ecosystem in the world with up to 30 distinct canopy tree species and a rich understory composition of plant, animal and microbial communities (Braun 1950;Muller 1982;McEwan et al. 2005). Geologically, the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forest region occurs within the Appalachian Coal Basin, which is the predominant coal resource in the eastern US (Ruppert 2001). The resultant surface coal mining has deforested and disturbed over 1.1 million ha within the central Appalachian region (Bernhardt and Palmer 2011). Appalachian surface mining uses explosives to remove geologic materials, called overburden, that overlie coal seams. Once the overburden is removed, coal is extracted. On large mines, the iterative process of removing overburden and coal may proceed vertically downward to remove multiple coal seams. The overburden is then used for reclamation to reconstruct the landscape to approximate original contour (AOC) to the extent feasible, unless an AOC variance has otherwise been obtained (Zipper et al. 1989). Coal mine reclamation in the US is regulated by a federal law, the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), which requires soil salvage and replacement unless a variance from this requirement is also obtained.",
        "e06ab8dd-345d-46b4-9435-62ee18fc21ef": "In Appalachia, miners are often able to receive such variances; hence, blasted overburden is often used as a topsoil substitute, essentially inverting the soil-geologic system as a starting point for reforestation. As a result of this reclamation process, Appalachian mine soils are often very rocky, with coarse fragments frequently exceeding 50 % (Torbert and Burger 2000). The overlapping rocks can create bridging voids that alter the hydrologic flow through the soil; potentially causing lower water storage capacity and differential settling (Sencindiver and Ammons 2000). Soil compaction, often to ensure slope stability during reclamation, causes mine soils to have high bulk densities, a condition that inhibits forest tree establishment and growth, likely due to effects such as lower soil aeration, root penetration, and water infiltration (Davidson et al. 1984;Torbert et al. 1988;Andrews et al. 1998;Jones et al. 2005). Furthermore, reclamation practices often emphasize rapid establishment of fastgrowing vegetative cover, that depresses survival and growth of planted trees (Torbert and Burger 2000;Angel et al. 2005). Such challenges are not unique to the Appalachian region, however. Globally, studies cite challenges such as soil toxicity, nutrient deficiencies, low organic matter content, low water holding capacity, and oxidation of acid-forming materials, as common issues in the post-mining reclamation process (e.g., Hu \u00a8ttl and Weber 2001; Seo et al. 2008). Methods have been developed to overcome many of these challenges and allow for successful reforestation of mine sites. Both in the US and abroad, reforestation efforts have largely focused on site preparation, topsoil replacement practices, and species-specific suitability for growth and survival based on local mine site conditions (Tacey and Glossop 1980;Knowles and Parrotta 1995;Parrotta and Knowles 2000;Bradshaw and Hu \u00a8ttl 2001).",

Specifically, in the Appalachian region of the US, efforts have focused on the establishment and productivity of a diverse native hardwood forest representative of the pre-mining condition. Site condition and species trials have been conducted within the Appalachian region of the US to determine the most successful methods to restore native hardwood species to the post-mining landscape (Torbert et al. 1985;Burger et al. 2005a, b;Burger et al. 2008;Burger and Fannon 2009). As a result, scientists and practitioners in the Appalachian region have developed the Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA), a set of best management practices to guide the reforestation of Appalachian mine sites with native hardwood trees (Burger et al. 2005a, b;Zipper et al. 2011). While these studies have been critical in determining the best site preparation methods, topsoil substitutes or amendments, and tree species to promote reforestation, an underlying assumption in many mined-land reforestation efforts is that the return of trees (e.g., species composition and density, components of ecosystem structure) will lead to the development of a forest ecosystem that mimics the functionality of the local unmined forest ecosystem. Even where such relationships are tested, they often focus too heavily on either aboveground (e.g., Parrotta and Knowles 2000) or belowground (e.g., Hu \u00a8ttl and Weber 2001; Chodak et al. 2009;Chodak and Niklin \u00b4ska 2010) aspects of the ecosystem as a focal point for evaluating the efficacy of reclamation.",

The EFA focuses on landscape functions analysis (soil resource condition), vegetation dynamics (species composition, species similarity to an analogous unmined site, presence and growth of target species) and habitat complexity (Bell 2001); however only infers ecosystem function based on more readily observable properties. While it is impossible to characterize the full suite of ecosystem properties and processes in any study, a more robust approach with multiple elements of both above-and belowground structure and function is essential in evaluating the restoration of an ecosystem. Thus, in this study we investigated the development of a select suite of critical forest ecosystem structural (e.g., aboveground and microbial biomass) and functional (e.g., C sequestration, N cycling, biosphere-atmosphere regulation) attributes on a chronosequence of reforested mine sites (ages 5, 11, 21, and 30 years) as well as a reference unmined forest. Our goals were to characterize the rates of return of these properties and processes, and determine if commonly measured metrics of forest structure (e.g., biomass, stem density) adequately represent the return of selected key ecosystem functions (e.g., elemental cycling).",

With exact stand age known, assessment of forest structure, biodiversity and biomass along a natural mangrove development chronosequence provides valuable information to define how long it takes mangrove restoration to return to a natural baseline condition.In natural settings, it is hypothesized that forest structure, diversity and biomass increase with stand age and that these are highest and most complex in intact mangroves. Thus, the study analyzed dynamics in species composition, forest structure and biomass across intact as well as naturally regenerated (NR) stands from 3, 6, 12, 18, and 25 years of age. Intact mangrove stands were structurally more complex and more diverse than younger stands. The preponderance of A. marina regeneration that appear for succession gives rise to a high importance value in the study area.

Mean individual tree mass to tree density relationship resembles the mean tree weight-density trajectory of self-thinning even-aged plant populations where mean individual tree mass increased with decreasing density. Naturally regenerated mangroves supported higher tree diversity with complex in stand structure compared to restored mangroves, which were basically comprised of Rhizophora species. Restored mangroves attain higher biomass in a shorter period of time compared to naturally regenerated mangroves. Mangrove restoration should focus on naturally regenerated mangroves in order to increase carbon sequestration and thus provide climate change mitigation. Ecosystem services, biodiversity and climate change mitigation values need to be considered for both mangrove types as restored mangroves lower tree diversity compared to naturally regenerated mangroves of the same age stand. Therefore it is suggested that sustainable management such as silviculture method might be suitable for naturally regenerated mangroves to absorb more carbon from atmosphere and maintain the higher diversity.",

Located in the ecotone of land-sea-estuary, mangrove ecosystems are heterogeneous habitats that are characterized by highly variable environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, rainfall, tidal currents, sedimentation, and nutrients (Ellison et al., 1999;Ashton and Macintosh, 2002). All these factors exhibit temporal and spatial variations that can act as environmental gradients that determine the distribution and density of species and individuals along the gradients (Lugo, 1980). The ability of mangrove aboveground roots, trunks and stems to trap and accumulate sediment by dampening currents and attenuating waves (Furukawa et al., 1997;Swales et al., 2007) is one particular factor that can result in natural re-colonization of areas adjacent to where local species occupy the shoreline and natural succession can occur (Mchenga and Ali, 2014). The colonization of intertidal flats also leads to the seaward expansion of mangroves. Therefore, known aged of natural regeneration provides a good model system to understand how stand development occurred along the chrnosequence stands and how long it takes regenerated mangroves to return to intact states. More recently, high levels of mangrove blue carbon storage and sequestration have revealed the important regulatory service mangroves can provide through climate change mitigation (Donato et al., 2011). This has led to an increased interest in structure and biomass studies in mangrove forests due to their importance in sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration (Gon\u00e7alves, 2018).",

Combined, forest structure, tree diversity, and biomass can have a significant effect on the function of the ecosystem that is relevant at the local to global scale. Concerning historical changes in coastal morphology, the role of stand age in mangrove structure and function has been overlooked to date and not very well explained. The degree to which mangrove communities' change with stand age remains unclear and is needed to better understand how mangroves function and how effective management actions are (e.g., restoration). While studies have attempted to estimate the time it takes for restored mangroves to provide similar levels of biodiversity and ecosystem services as natural stands (Salmo et al., 2013;Ferreira et al., 2015;Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2017;Sharma et al., 2020), the exact age of natural mangroves is difficult to determine as they have been in existence for hundreds if not thousands of years. It is necessary to understand how the dynamics of mangrove forests change over time through monitoring stand structure, tree diversity, and biomass along stand age gradients to recognize future impact of global climate change. Malaysia is endowed with very numerous pristine and estuarine mangroves. Most studies in Malaysia on how mangrove forest structure, diversity and biomass change with stand age have focused on natural stands versus degraded (Wah et al., 2011;Zhila et al., 2014;Rozainah et al., 2018b) and reforested mangroves (Alongi et al., 2004;Goessens et al., 2014).

The results show that the duration of vegetation on the sites substantially increased microbial biomass and shifted the microbial community structure even after only 4 years. However, microbial communities and biomass did not recover to the status of native vegetation even after 35 years of vegetation cover. A redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation analysis indicated that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available potassium, soil water content, silt content and soil hardness explained 98.4% of total variability in the microbial community composition.

It is estimated that 2.5 cm of new topsoil is formed every 100 to 1000 years, equivalent to 0.4-4.0 Mg ha -1 year -1 (Pimentel et al. 1976). Depending on site characteristics, it can take up to 200 years to form 1 cm of soil, while it may be eroded in a few minutes by even a moderate rain storm (Verheijen et al. 2009). Degraded soils cover approximately 24% of the global land area (Pimentel et al. 1995;Ball et al. 2007). Apart from implications to global food security and environmental quality, land degradation reduces biological productivity and affects environmental, social, and economic development (Nunes et al. 2012). The causes for degradation are both natural and humaninduced. Natural causes include water and wind erosion, organic matter depletion, salinity, acidification, loss of soil biodiversity, crusting and sealing, waterlogging and compaction; anthropogenic causes are the result of land clearing and forest degradation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and waste, over-grazing, poor or inappropriate forest management, surface mining, urban sprawl, and commercial/industrial development (Douglas and Charles 2015). Erosion by water is the most widespread form of soil degradation worldwide (Oldeman et al. 1991). Nearly all of Europe is affected by soil erosion (Blum 1990); losses due to water erosion are high in southern Europe and becoming an everincreasing problem in northern Europe. Soil degradation due to either water or wind is inextricably linked to the loss of soil organic matter, and in many North American soils, has decreased by 30% to 40% (Brady and Weil 2008). Water erosion of soils also occurs in the southern hemisphere. Degraded ecosystems such as those in northeastern Brazil and eastern Amazonia have been extensively studied (Denich et al. 2004;Nunes et al.",
        "4c55c8e9-2f1b-4dc0-8c5f-23c77dad4f15": "2004;Nunes et al. 2012). China is one of many countries suffering from severe soil erosion (Zhao et al. 2013). Erosion occurs only in arid and semiarid regions such as on the Loess plateau, but is also common in humid subtropical China. The second most typically eroded soil area after the Loess plateau is the granite red soil region. Historically, due to low levels of economic development, humans have been destroying vegetation on this soil type to maintain their livelihoods. Excessive extraction of natural resources such as overlogging, grazing and farming are widely to blame for severe soil erosion in the red soil regions of southern China over the past six decades (Wang et al. 2011a, b;Xie et al. 2013). Ecological restoration based on improving soil properties and increasing vegetation cover represents a promising approach to the recovery of soil productivity and sustainability (Cooke and Johnson 2002). A chronosequence approach has been frequently used to investigate changes in vegetation and soil properties over temporal or spatial scales (Kalinina et al. 2015;Boecker et al. 2015). It has been used to examine the effects of time on ecological succession, soil development, and vegetation recovery following disturbance. The chronosequence design can assist in our understanding of the recovery of soil microbiota over long time periods and can provide critical information to influence successional processes for restoration (Li et al. 2010;Walker et al. 2010;Gasch et al. 2014). Land degradation leads to a loss of productivity that results from the loss of soil organic matter, reduces soil fertility, and decreases soil microbial biomass and activities (Lal 1996;Carpenter et al. 2001;Nunes et al. 2012). Soil microorganisms are an important indicator of ecological health and play crucial roles in the decomposition and mineralization of plant and animal residues present in the soil. They respond more quickly to variations in biotic and abiotic factors than to changes in soil organic matter (Marinari et al. 2006;Brookes et al.",
        "ef7dd837-87f6-4be5-a258-9bb8e5f711e3": "2006;Brookes et al. 2008). Differences in soil microbial biomass may lead to shifts in the important functions of soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Studies have shown that soil microorganisms play key roles in mediating ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling by utilizing aboveground plant litter, as well as belowground plant roots and soil organic matter as sources of nutrients and energy (Zeller et al. 2001;Hargreaves and Hofmockel 2014;Huang et al. 2014). Fresh plant exudate inputs stimulate microbial activities and soil organic matter decomposition (Cheng et al. 2003;Kuzyakov et al. 2009). For example, the key results indicates that the rate of soil organic matter decomposition is partially controlled by the microbial community, and that microbial biomass and activity are regulated by the availability of fresh carbon sources (Fontaine et al. 2011;Huang et al. 2014). When soil nutrient availability is high, microbes increase the rate of fresh organic matter decomposition, whereas when microbial decomposition of soil organic matter declines, soil organic matter decreases. The exhaustion of fresh organic matter and low soil nutrient availability enhances the microbial decomposition of SOM, eventually leading to its loss (Fontaine et al. 2003(Fontaine et al. , 2011;;Huang et al. 2014). As a result, evaluating the effects of land restoration on soil microbial communities is critical to better understanding their effects on soil organic matter accumulation and decomposition, as well as on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Microbial composition and biomass are also directly affected by biotic factors (e.g., soil fauna) and abiotic factors such as pH, moisture, and the environment (Dimitriu and Grayston 2010; Wu et al. 2011;Chen et al. 2012;Barnard et al. 2013;Huang et al. 2014;Banerjee et al. 2016). Vegetation restoration is widely accepted as an effective means of dramatically increasing soil fertility (Chen et al.",

During the period of restoring the site's vegetation, changes in species composition and cover can alter litter input, root architecture, and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil (Ren et al. 2017;Zhao et al. 2017). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in investigating the effects of vegetation restoration on soil biological properties (Mummey et al. 2002;Frouz and Novakova 2005;An et al. 2009;Xu et al. 2010). This is because microbial communities are crucial to the functioning of soils, and are responsible for establishing biogeochemical cycles, for energy transfer, and in forming soil structure (Diaz et al. 1993;Preston et al. 2001). Therefore, it is important to assess the impacts of vegetation restoration on soil microbial community structure and biomass during the restoration process. However, how soil microbial properties develop during vegetation restoration remains poorly understood. Reforestation of degraded soils can improve physiochemical properties but little is known about the interactions between soil microbes and soil physicochemical properties in the southern red soil area. This research is based on a case study of Changting County, Fujian Province, a typical area of erosion of red soil in southern China. Methods such as closing hillsides for afforestation, i.e., planting trees and grasses, have been successful and widely utilized to restore degraded ecosystems over the last decade (Yue and Chen 2003;Li et al. 2008;Gao et al. 2011;Zhong et al. 2013). However, there is little information on soil microbial community structure and biomass evaluation along a chronosequence, especially in the degraded lands in of Changting County.",

We hypothesized that: (1) after four years, vegetation restoration will substantially increase microbial biomass and alter the microbial community structure; (2) vegetation restoration after 35 years will return to native vegetation; and (3) key environmental factors affect the soil microbial community composition and biomass.",

A possible explanation is that, with the extension of recovery time, the ability of vegetation to intercept precipitation reduced the loss of clay and silt particles. Clay particles in Changting County are prone to erosion by water. Another possible explanation is that a variety of soil macrofauna (e.g., varieties of earthworms and ants) are helpful to improve soil water content (SWC), bulk density (BD), total porosity (tp), soil hardness (SH) (Buse 1990;Ho \u00a8lldobler and Wilson 1990;Jordan et al. 1999;Ponder and Tadros 2002;Edwards 2004;Cerda `and Jurgensen 2008;Cerda \u00e8t al. 2009;Benckiser 2010;Blouin et al. 2013). A further explanation is that these plants have deep root systems which can exploit cracks, voids and large pores, as well as enlarge small pores, all of which have a positive influence on root biomass (Rutigliano et al. 2004;Jiao et al. 2008). The relatively evenly distributed roots throughout the surface and litter layers are conducive to improving soil physical properties. There are more large pores and the soil quality is improved as the roots grow (Bai et al. 2016;Zhao et al. 2017;Zhang et al. 2017). Soil pH decreased with longer recovery years in agreement with previous vegetation recovery studies (Berthrong et al. 2009;Kalinina et al. 2015). The reasons were, first, changes occurred in root and ectomycorrhizal exudate quality, which often contain high amounts and varieties of organic acids (Grayston et al. 1997). Secondly, the uptake of cations by tree roots increased (Jobba \u00b4gy and Jackson 2003).",
        "9e198e1d-bbb2-4f74-9e02-92e56db24dfc": "Thirdly, possibly because of the organic acids released by the roots, soil microorganisms and exchangeable cations were lost to plant uptake (Alfredsson et al. 1998). A final reason for the decrease in pH is the accumulation of soil organic matter. Soil nutrients accumulated with longer restoration years (Deng et al. 2015;Deng and Shangguan 2017), which agree with our findings. Vegetation changes in soil physicochemical properties occurred over time and indirectly affected the amount of runoff and soil loss (Janssens et al. 1998;Pohl et al. 2009). The duration of vegetation cover influenced soil chemical characteristics mainly through the quantity and chemical components of plant foliage, litter, and roots (Sourkova et al. 2005;Ostertag et al. 2008;Marin-Spiotta et al. 2009). Litter decomposition in different years is regulated by the interaction between decomposers and substrate quality, which were both directly affected by abiotic and biotic factors. Different vegetation restoration years have different vertical vegetation structures (aboveground cover, surface litter layer, and underground roots), leading to differences in rainfall interception and thereby reducing the occurrence of splash erosion and runoff accumulation, and increasing soil nutrients (Bochet et al. 1998;Ross et al. 1999;Calder 2001).

We believed that stable soil temperature and humidity were factors controlling litter decomposition rates. Salinas et al. (2011) found that soil temperatures explained 95% of the variation in the rate of decomposition. Suitable temperatures and humidity can accelerate litter and roots (coarse and fine roots) decomposition by enhancing litter microbial activity. At small scales (20 m 9 20 m), micro-meteorological conditions incorporate both soil temperature and soil humidity, which is particularly important for relatively infertile sites such as the HDL and 4 year plots (soil temperature and soil humidity in an unstable micro-meteorological environment). In general, legumes such as Lespedeza bicolor Turcz. have low nutrient-use efficiency and strong effects on N availability and supply in both natural and agricultural systems (Fornara and Tilman 2008).

It is therefore important to evaluate the impact of alternative forest exploitation on the improvement of soil C and N accumulation on these soils. This study compared pure and mixed plantations of Eucalyptus grandis and Pseudosamanea guachapele, a N 2 -fixing leguminous tree, in relation to their effects on soil C and N stocks. The studied Planosol area had formerly been covered by Panicum maximum pasture for at least ten years without any fertilizer addition. To estimate C and N contents, the soil was sampled (at depths of 0-2.5; 2.5-5.0; 5.0-7.5; 7.5-10.0; 10.0-20.0 and 20.0-40.0 cm), in pure and mixed five-year-old tree plantations, as well as on adjacent pasture. The natural abundance 13 C technique was used to estimate the contribution of the soil organic C originated from the trees in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Soil C and N stocks under mixed plantation were 23.83 and 1.74 Mg ha -1 , respectively. Under guachapele, eucalyptus and pasture areas C stocks were 14.20, 17.19 and 24.24 Mg ha -1 , respectively. For these same treatments, total N contents were 0.83; 0.99 and 1.71 Mg ha -1 , respectively. Up to 40 % of the soil organic C in the mixed plantation was estimated to be derived from trees, while in pure eucalyptus and guachapele plantations these same estimates were only 19 and 27 %, respectively.

This land use calls for new management techniques that would lessen impacts on biodiversity and processes of soil fertility exhaustion (Novais & Barros, 1997;Paschoal, 2005;Forrester et al., 2006). The tolerance of eucalyptus to soil acidity and high Al contents, its adaptability to low soil fertility, and the ability to absorb N from different sources (Neves et al., 1990;Grespan et al., 1998) suggest that the use of this species in mixed plantations with N 2 -fixing leguminous trees could improve soil fertility and contribute to a more sustainable land use. Recent studies showed that intercropping eucalyptus with tree legumes was not detrimental to timber yield and resulted in increased soil N availability for eucalyptus (Binkley et al., 1992;Balieiro et al., 2002;Forrester et al., 2006). These results suggest that the implementation of such mixed forests may result in significant economical and ecological advantages due to the N input through biological nitrogen fixation (Forrester et al., 2006). Another benefit of intercropping eucalyptus with leguminous trees is a potential increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Since eucalyptus litter degrades very slowly, it seems to contribute little to SOM replenishment (Resh et al., 2002). However, the lower C/N ratio of the legume combined with eucalyptus litter results in a material with a higher turnover rate that could influence eucalyptus production (Balieiro et al., 2004;Forrester et al., 2006) and SOM contents (Resh et al., 2002;Resende et al., 2006) positively.",

The photosynthetic process in plants discriminates the 13C isotope against the lower atomic weight 12C at the carboxylation step. This discrimination is higher in C3 (Calvin cycle) than in C4 (Hatch-Slack cycle) plants, which brings about a 13C isotopic signature for each material that is relatively well preserved after decomposition in soil. Based on these differences, the analysis of the 13C natural abundance of SOM can be used to simply identify the C source to this C-pool or to investigate the SOM dynamics based on 13C natural abundance changes when a vegetation of long standing was replaced by another with a different 13C composition (Balesdent et al., 1988;Neill et al., 1997).

We placed forty litterfall traps in four plots at each reclaimed site and in a tropical dry mature forest, which was used as a reference ecosystem. Fine litterfall (including woody material up to 2 cm in length) was collected monthly from October 2013 to November 2014. Values for the highest fine litterfall recorded in the 21year-old site (2.3 Mg ha -1 year -1 ) were more than double those recorded in the 7-year-old site (1.1 Mg ha -1 year -1 ). Soil carbon and nitrogen contents were greater in the rehabilitated sites than in the unrestored substrate. Soil phosphorus (P) increased significantly 7 years after rehabilitation. The high return of organic matter and nutrients via fine litterfall in the three rehabilitated sites suggests that the rehabilitation approach employed in this opencast coalmine was successful in terms of enriching soil organic matter content and nutrient status and that it could serve as a model for the rehabilitation of similarly degraded mining habitats.",

One of the most significant disturbances associated with opencast coal mining is the loss of soil organic matter, which is one of the major indicators of change in the quality and health of the soils (Adeli et al., 2013). The vegetation growing in these mining areas is known to allow the recovery of ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, and water infiltration into the soil (Wedderburn and Carter, 1999;Sierra and Nygren, 2006). This is the result of the occupation, exploration, and death of plant fine roots in the soil. It is also due to the production and decomposition of fine litter from the above-ground biomass (Kumar, 2008;Le\u00f3n and Osorio, 2014), which is considered as the main transfer mechanism of organic matter and nutrients from vegetation to soil (Celentano et al., 2011). It has been clearly demonstrated that the contribution of fine litterfall of planted forest species (e.g. Pinus nigra J.F Arnold., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) improved the quality of the substrate in open-pit coal mines (Filcheva et al., 2000;Melo et al., 2018), promoting greater biological activity (i.e., a higher rate of decomposition and, in turn, a higher amount of organic matter and nutrient release to the soil). Therefore, the use of biological indicators that are capable of revealing the synergistic effects of plant communities and time on the soil should be considered. In addition, these biogeochemical processes must be carefully studied to assess the success of land rehabilitation. Opencast coal mining takes place under extreme drought conditions in La Guajira (Colombian Caribbean region).

We hypothesize that the contribution of fine litterfall to the organic matter in mining substrates increases over time, and that this contribution may approach that of mature forests.

Successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge of the role of species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations. Despite this need, solid data on the long-term development of forest plantations are still very scarce. Monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77-year-old tree diversity experiment in Yangambi in the Congo basin were fully inventoried. We calculated above-ground C stocks using allometric equations, and soil C stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks. A high variability in aboveground C stocks across tree species combinations was observed. Apart from a species identity effect, the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area (BA pl ) and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon (AGC), with BA pl being more important. Both AGC and BA pl were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species; the planting of short-lived pioneers led to low AGC. We found no clear benefits, but also no drawbacks, for AGC of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including nitrogen fixing species in the plantation scheme. However, the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth. We conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks. This was predominantly caused by large differences in AGC sequestration over the past 77 years. Altogether, short-lived pioneer species had a low BA pl resulting in low carbon sequestration, while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest AGC stocks. Tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the AGC stock, given that the appropriate functional type is planted.",

The latter two processes give rise to 95% of the C emissions in the tropics, which equals nearly 10% of the global fossil fuel emissions (Achard 2004, Houghton et al. 2012, Le Que \u00b4re \u00b4et al. 2015). This stresses the importance of carbon offset projects in the tropics, such as afforestation or reforestation, as currently traded in the voluntary carbon market or, to a lesser extent, financed by the Clean Development Mechanism (Canadell and Raupach 2008, Jindal et al. 2008, Cerbu et al. 2011). However, implementation of such programs frequently results in plantations of fast growing monocultures of non-native species (Cossalter and Pye-Smith 2003). While this approach guarantees high carbon sequestration rates, it ignores other important co-benefits of reforestation in the tropics, such as natural forest restoration and biodiversity recovery, for which native species are better suited (Lamb et al. 2005, Greve et al. 2013). But the combination of a bigger species pool, along with the lack of knowledge on the species in the tropics, makes the selection of appropriate species difficult and hazardous for the success of a carbon-offset project (van Breugel et al. 2011).There is a clear need for results of long-term experiments to create a set of management guidelines for selection of suited native species. Research efforts in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have pointed out that both biodiversity and species identity have an important effect on a variety of ecosystem processes, such as ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration (Loreau et al. 2001, Hooper et al. 2005, Cardinale et al. 2012). However, most of the published studies focus on short-lived grassland ecosystems (Tilman et al.",

The emphasis of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research has therefore recently shifted to these long-lived ecosystems, resulting in e.g., tree diversity experiments (Scherer-Lorenzen et al. 2005). These experiments intend to have an orthogonal design, which avoids the risk that differences in management or soil conditions mask the link between tree diversity and ecosystem processes (Scherer-Lorenzen et al. 2005). Yet, most of these manipulative experiments have been installed during the last decade and were setup in the temperate regions (Verheyen et al. 2015), leaving tropical ecosystems understudied. Moreover, results of plantation studies are predominantly derived from experiments with fast growing, non-native tree species (e.g., Forrester et al. 2006). The Yangambi reserve, in the center of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), holds a tree diversity experiment, set up by the Belgian colonials. It provides us with information on 77 years of experimental forest development in the tropics.

Remark that we did not assess carbon stocks related to the below-ground biomass. The classification of the functional groups was done using only shade tolerance and wood density, which is consistent with previous work (e.g., Poorter et al. 2006). We stress that these functional types should also be mainly interpreted in terms of shade tolerance and wood density. Tree species in functional types SLP and LLP have a high light requirement, but differ in their allocation to mechanical stability or growth rate (Selaya and Anten 2008). PST species can establish in low light conditions but need gaps to grow, while the ST species can grow in the low light conditions (Poorter et al. 2006).",

However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation.

Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.",

It was recently reported that the net flux of carbon derived from landuse change accounted for up to 12.5% of the anthropogenic carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010 (Houghton et al., 2012). Oppositely, some land-use changes have been acknowledged as tools to mitigate emissions of CO 2 by providing a sink for C; afforestation being one of them. Afforestation is defined as the planting of trees on lands which historically have not contained forest cover (IPCC, 2007). In Europe, changes in agricultural policies, timber shortage, and the recognition of afforestation measures for accounting to meet the emission reduction commitments from the Kyoto Protocol have promoted afforestation. For all these reasons, the total forest area in Europe has increased 25% since 1950, with most pronounced increments in Western and Northern Europe (Fuchs et al., 2013). During the past 2 decades a number of studies have reviewed changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks quantitatively, either for different land-use changes (Post & Kwon, 2000;Guo & Gifford, 2002;Don et al., 2011;Poeplau et al., 2011) or more specifically concerning changes following a certain type of conversion, such as afforestation (Paul et al., 2002;Berthrong et al., Correspondence: Teresa G omez de la B arcena, tel.",

The majority of these studies focused on large scales to investigate global patterns of SOC change with land-use change. So far, several drivers of SOC change have been identified, such as climate, former land-use, forest age, forest type, soil type (and clay content), nitrogen deposition, and management practices (Jobb agy & Jackson, 2000;Guo & Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002;Callesen et al., 2003;Leifeld et al., 2005;Jandl et al., 2007;Sutton et al., 2008;Lagani ere et al., 2010). With regard to former land use, there is a general agreement on a net SOC gain following afforestation of croplands or other SOC-depleted systems at the global or temperate region scale (Lagani ere et al., 2010;Poeplau et al., 2011;Nave et al., 2013), while SOC losses are generally observed following afforestation of more SOC-rich systems such as grasslands (Guo & Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002;Shi et al., 2013). A major determinant of changes in SOC is time. After land-use change, a transition phase is often reported to take place (Paul et al., 2002), and in terms of SOC this transition is characterized by a loss of SOC followed by a recovery phase, its length probably being determined by the above-mentioned drivers.",
        "f24cd883-0ff3-4792-9c90-b6dc4936e86d": "Northern Europe has been absent or sparsely represented in previous quantitative reviews on SOC and land-use change (Scott et al., 1999;Post & Kwon, 2000;Johnson & Curtis, 2001;Guo & Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002Lagani ere et al., 2010;Don et al., 2011;Poeplau et al., 2011;Li et al., 2012;Nave et al., 2013;Shi et al., 2013). There is a need for further knowledge in this important area, not only because Northern Europe is a hot spot of land-use change (Fuchs et al., 2013), but also due to the importance of the SOC pool in northern regions, as the ratio of SOC with respect to vegetation C increases with latitude (Lal, 2005). Moreover, an increasing number of studies reporting data on SOC changes in diverse land uses have become available for Northern Europe, thereby enabling analyses at this more restricted spatial scale. The novelty of this study also relies on the improvements incorporated to the meta-analysis methodology on SOC and land-use change by: (i) evaluating the influence of nonindependence between samples; (ii) investigating confounding effects; and (iii) estimating SOC stock changes according to equal masses. We aimed to synthesize major changes in SOC stocks following afforestation in Northern Europe by means of a meta-analysis. We studied the relative SOC changes that took place after afforestation, with focus on former land-use, age dynamics, forest type, and soil textural class, considering possible confounding effects between these factors. Moreover, we investigated differences in the relative SOC change between soil layers (upper and deeper mineral soil) as well as the contribution of forest floor C.",

Field-based AGB and AGBC estimates are vital for carbon cycle study and provide inputs for data-deficit regional and global carbon and climate models.In this paper we generated the primary baseline data on tree composition, species richness (SR), AGB and AGBC gathered from nine 10,000 m 2 long-term ecological research (LTER) plots in three distinct PFTs {dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP)} within an Indian tropical deciduous forest along Himalayan foothills during 2009-2012. The functional relationship of PFT structural attributes i.e. SR, density, basal cover, leaf area index and litter fall on AGB was investigated. PCA was applied to study the relationship between PFT microclimate, structural attributes and diversity vs. AGB.A total of 22, 22 and 6 tree species were found in DM, SM and TP PFT, respectively. Shannon's diversity index was highest (2.46) in DM, whereas Simpson's dominance index was maximum (0.85) in TP. AGB (Mg ha -1 ) ranged from 290.82-455.99 among all PFTs.

        "503e263f-361e-4761-813d-aa6489d4bacf": "Tropical forests are important carbon pools, comprising approximately 40% of terrestrial carbon storage (Dixon et al., 1994). The tropical forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the earth, estimated to account for above one-third of global net primary productivity (NPP) (Gaston et al., 1998;Field et al., 1998), but have been relatively under-sampled compared with their importance. Tropical deciduous forests are forests occurring in tropical regions characterized by pronounced seasonality in rainfall distribution, with few months of drought period. The aboveground biomass (AGB) of a forest ecosystem is one of the fundamental parameters describing its functioning. Studies on biomass of forest vegetation are essential for determining storage of the carbon in the dominant tree component and computing the carbon cycling at regional as well as global level. Measurement of AGB of dominant tree species in different forest communities/plant functional types is of great importance because the dominant tree species greatly influence the magnitude and pattern of energy flow that is stored in trunks, branches, leaves and roots in the form of various organic substances and material remained in continuous circulation between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. The quantity of AGB in a forest is the result of the difference between production through photosynthesis and consumption through respiration, mortality, harvest, and herbivory. Estimation of AGB is an essential aspect of studies of carbon stocks and global carbon balance (Ketterings et al., 2001). Estimating AGB is a useful measure for comparing structural and functional attributes of forest ecosystems across a wide range of environmental conditions (Brown et al., 1999). Permanent sampling plots have long been used in ecological studies for assessing how much biomass is held in ecosystem (Brown, 2002;Fearnside, 1996). Tree AGB is strongly correlated with trunk diameter (Brown and Lugo, 1992;Brown, 1997) and it is therefore possible to use forest inventory data to estimate the stocks and changes in AGB in those inventories.",

Variations in environmental factors such as topography, hydrology and edaphic characteristics (e.g soil nutrient availability) may also complicate attempts to generalize stand density and AGB over regional or landscape scale (Clark and Clark, 2000). AGB is thus of direct applied importance for estimating ecosystem carbon storage and fluxes (Brown, 1997;Baker et al., 2004;Fearnside, 1997;Nelson et al., 1999). Biomass fluctuation with time and space involving stand dynamics can be estimated by repeated tree census, so that changes due to growth and mortality of trees can be followed in a given area (Chave et al., 2003). Indian forests are a major tropical forest ecosystem constituting nearly 701,673 sq. km (70.17 million ha), 21.34% of the geographical area of country (State of forest report (SFR), 2015). Indian tropical deciduous forest are species rich with associates of varied phenophases having irregular distribution of stem densities and basal cover. Additionally, Indian deciduous forests have multistoried canopy with different microclimate which makes it complex for understanding the patters of AGB within and among different plant functional types (PFTs) over space and time (Blackburn and Gaston, 1996;Behera et al., 2012). There remains much uncertainty how tropical forests will respond to future climate changes (Gaston et al., 1998). Information on AGB and AGBC at PFT class level in Indian tropical deciduous forests is needed for real-time assessment of national carbon stock and further global carbon crediting.",

Detailed species level AGB measurements in different PFT classes will help to identify the keystone species sequestering higher AGB, for sustainable carbon stock management and biodiversity conservation. PFT class wise AGB assessment will also help to validate the projections of global carbon model output with ground data. Estimating the biomass stock of tropical deciduous forests and understanding their role in regulating the cycling of carbon and nutrients is on high priority (Cairns et al., 1997). Although few past studies including remote sensing approach attempted to estimate the AGB and biomass carbon in Terai regions including Doon valley, no detailed study exist investigating the patters of AGB and biomass carbon at PFT level from Indian tropical deciduous forests (Kumar, 2009;Pandey et al., 2010;Mandal and Joshi, 2014;Mohommad and Joshi, 2015). Considering the above research gaps, the presents study was undertaken in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary at Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, India.

We investigated such degradation effects by comparing degraded agricultural land (previously covered with forest) with neighboring natural forests, 40 to 50 years after conversion. We selected four different study areas to cover the eco-climatic conditions of the Amhara region in Northwestern Ethiopia. For a paired-stand comparison we collected soil data on both land use types. We calculated forest biomass to evaluate the biogeochemical-mechanistic ecosystem model Biome-BGC, which is used as a diagnostic tool to assess the site and management impacts on productivity as well as ecosystem carbon and nitrogen accumulation. We applied Biome-BGC to assess rehabilitation options on such degraded land. Afromontane forests in the highlands of Ethiopia showed high soil C stocks, resulting from long lasting biomass accumulation. Removing the tree cover and converting forest areas to crop-or grassland, has led to a loss of 40-85% of the soil C stocks and thus a loss in soil fertility within only 40 to 50 years. Rehabilitation efforts by replanting trees will improve soil fertility, but may require over a thousand years to achieve a similar level in biomass and soil fertility versus the situation prior to the land use change.",

Tropical forests are threatened by deforestation due to land use changes. A good example is Ethiopia, which experienced a decline in forest covered land area from 40% to less than 10% during the last century [3]. The removal of the forest cover has resulted in severe soil erosion, species extinction, as well as reduction in productivity and carbon sequestration [4]. The main reasons for the rapid land use change is the expansion of agricultural land associated with the demand for fuelwood for a fast growing population [5]. Ethiopia has a population of about 100 million people and an estimated annual increase of 3% or 3 million people, 73% of them working in the agricultural sector [6]. For the rural population, it is increasingly difficult to cover the supply of fuel wood for heating homes and cooking, since only small forest areas are left, and the remaining forests are largely protected. In most of the cases, these forests remained because they are located next to monasteries and are preserved as \"church forests\". However, these \"church forests\" are not untouched, since we can observe strong evidence for forest management impacts. In order to avoid further deforestation and to promote afforestation, the Ethiopian government has selected the forestry sector as one of the green economic pillars to be developed by 2030 [7]. The key goals of the green economy plan are: (i) avoiding further deforestation, (ii) inducing reforestation programs, and (iii) improving forest management by establishing sustainable forest management plans. Ethiopia already takes part in international reforestation programs [8,9] and has expanded its national goal for reforestation and afforestation to reach 7 million hectares of forests [10].",
        "a7a62724-7fe9-47ac-963c-1698c637ab4b": "The goals of the green economy plan are consistent with the strategy for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), promoting sustainable forest management, conserving forest carbon stocks, and increasing the forest carbon stocks of developing countries [11][12][13][14][15]. One of the main difficulties in implementing REDD+ activities is measuring and ensuring the sustainability of forest management activities based on consistent and reliable biomass and soil data [12,16]. Out of three different common approaches for assessing the dynamics of forest ecosystems, (i) repeated forest inventories, (ii) repeated forest cover, NPP and NEE estimates from remote sensing (NPP-Net Primary Production, NEE-Net Ecosystem Exchange), and (iii) the application of ecosystem models e.g., biogeochemical-mechanistic models [17], only the latter is applicable for Amhara region. Repeated forest inventories are not available in many developing countries, including Ethiopia whereas remote sensing technology [18][19][20] has strong limitations when it comes to addressing stand density changes (e.g., changes in the number of trees within a given stand due to forest management) if the crown cover-often expressed by the leaf area index-is assumed to remain closed [21][22][23][24]. The third carbon assessment option, the application of biogeochemical-mechanistic ecosystem models (BGC-Models) has several advantages. For a comparison of different BGC-Models, see [25,26]. BGC-Models address carbon, nitrogen, water and energy flux dynamics (above and below ground) within ecosystems and respond to forest management and climate change effects [27][28][29][30][31]. The carbon storage of ecosystems can be calculated based on key input data such as daily weather, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, general soil information (soil depth, texture) and an eco-physiological parameter setting characterizing the vegetation type or species. Biome-BGC specifically has the advantage that it is fully prognostic, applicable on large temporal and spatial scales and includes effects of forest management on carbon and nitrogen stocks [27].",

So far, data on soil recovery from afforestation in Ethiopia only cover the development of 30-40 years [32][33][34] and most often involve Eucalyptus sp., Cupressus lucitanica or other exotic species because of their fast growth [35]. In this study, we investigate the impact of deforestation and the long-term recovery process of degraded land expressed by carbon sequestration potential from afforestation to improve our understanding of land-use change and forest management on the soil carbon dynamics. We obtained forest and soil data from different agro-ecological zones and land use types in the Amhara region, and applied the biogeochemical-mechanistic ecosystem model Biome-BGC to assess the flux dynamics within the highlands of Afromontane forests in the Amhara region of Northwestern Ethiopia. The key objectives of our study are: 1. Evaluate the biogeochemical ecosystem model Biome-BGC for Ethiopian Afromontane forests.",

Although the species composition of the natural Afromontane forests in Ethiopia is very rich and diverse, the eco-physiological parameter settings suggested by [66] are applicable within the area. After adjusting for the length of the growing season (on the site with predominant deciduous vegetation cover) and addressing harvesting impacts, the above ground biomass, as well as soil carbon and NPP predictions derived with Biome-BGC revealed consistent estimates versus field observations (Figures 4 and5). This suggests that our chosen approach mimics the ecosystem fluxes (i.e., carbon, nitrogen and water) as well as potential harvesting impacts correctly for Afromontane ecosystems of the Amhara region of Northwestern Ethiopia. This is an important finding because forests cover about 251,000 ha or 2% of the total land area (15.7 million. ha) in Amhara region [38], but no systematic forest monitoring or empirically driven forest growth and yield model for ensuring sustainable forest management is in place. Considering the enormous pressure of a fast-growing population on the remaining forest resources, this lack of information is one of the key obstacles for sustainable forest management in the region. The option we tested in this study to circumvent this lack of information is the application of biogeochemical-mechanistic modeling theories. Although the model results fit with the observed data (Figures 4 and5), the limitations of the modeling approach versus growth and yield models is the level of abstraction in the general modeling approach. This makes forest stand specific predictions, including single tree mortality or specific harvesting operations, difficult [67]. This may be one of the reasons that the model predicted higher vegetation carbon versus the observations in Taragedam (Figure 4), as the study sites in Taragedam experienced stronger human interventions and cattle grazing versus the other study sites [71,72]. The key problem within the highlands of the Amhara region is land use change (the conversion of forests into agricultural area) to feed a fast growing population [4,73,74].",
        "9fec246a-5bca-4e5a-ad81-c94ab9c76f8d": "An enormous loss in soil fertility due to erosion is associated with this reduction in forest area. We observed that 40 to 50 years after converting forests into agricultural land, the carbon and nitrogen content in the soil declined by 40% to 85% of the remaining neighboring forested areas (Table 3). The dramatic deterioration of the soils within this short period of time is also reported by other studies showing similar trends [75,76]. The underlying parent material in Amhara is granite with an extremely low release of nutrients from weathering. Removal of the forest cover leads to enormous soil erosion during the heavy and intensive rainy season [34], associated with a removal of the top soil layer. Once the forest vegetation and the top soil layer are gone, the key source for nutrients is gone [32]. Future productivity is therefore jeopardized by two effects, i.e., loss in nutrients through vegetation clearing and erosion, and the low rates of replenishing of the lost nutrients from weathering of the rock and from nitrogen deposition and fixation [77]. One option to stabilize and eventually ameliorate productivity is to replant forests on such degraded sites. Any permanent land cover will decrease further erosion and will lead to nitrogen and litter input due to litterfall and consequently to a recovery of the carbon and nutrient stocks, and the water retention capacity. The rate of carbon pool accumulation varied by harvesting intensity (Figure 5). Regardless of the employed harvesting scenario, soil fertility will increase again, but it will stabilize at different levels according to the harvesting intensity. Remarkably, the soil carbon equilibrium levels for the two management scenarios lie below the current forest soil carbon stocks. This indicates that the current higher forest soil carbon stocks (Figure 4) are a legacy of a former 'better' climate (compare Section 3.2, climate assumption for the spin-up: 20% higher precipitation and 3 \u2022 C lower temperature in comparison to today). Thus, although afforestation is strongly recommended since it has a high ameliorating potential of degraded soils, it is questionable if the mistakes from the past can ever be fully repaired under today's climatic conditions.",

However, a scenario of more irregular and intensive precipitation events [78] would increase erosion and slow down the soil recovery especially in the already water-limited lowland areas of Amhara region. In any case, the importance of avoiding deforestation in the first place, is the key message which needs to be conveyed to any government in tropical developing countries around the globe.",

In this study, we identify potentially suitable areas for reforestation to assess the carbon sequestration potential in the highly deforested and degraded Amhara region of Ethiopia. We apply biogeochemical mechanistic ecosystem modelling to predict the amount of carbon that can be potentially sequestered within different time horizons. Since human intervention plays a key role within the Amhara region, three different forest management scenarios and five different rotation periods following reforestation are tested: (i) unthinned; (ii) removal of 5% of the stem carbon every 20 years (thinning 1); and (iii) removal of 10% stem carbon every 20 years (thinning 2), as well as a rotation period of 10, 30, 50, 100, and 150 years. Sustainable management of reforested land is addressed by implementing the so called 'Normal-forest' system (equal representation of every age class). This ensures the long term sequestration effect of reforested areas. The study shows that 3.4 Mha (Mha = Million hectare) of land, including bare land (0.7 Mha), grass land (1.2 Mha), and shrub land (1.5 Mha) can be considered as ecologically potentially suitable for reforestation. Assuming a 100 year rotation period in a 'Normal-forest' system, this shows that a total net carbon sequestration potential of 177 Tg C (10.8 Tg C in the soil and 165.9 Tg C aboveground; Teragram = 10 12 g) is possible, if all 3.4 Mha are replanted.

The highest proportion of terrestrial carbon is stored in forest ecosystems [1]. Thus forests are important to balance global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) [2][3][4]. Human activities are important considerations because land use change and forest management directly affect the forest conditions and thus the carbon cycle. In Ethiopia, population growth and investment followed by deforestation and land use change have led to a dramatic decline in forest land during the last decades [5][6][7]. Additionally, we see heavy disturbances in the remaining natural forests, such as cattle grazing or logging that result in severe soil degradation [8][9][10]. A study in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia revealed a decrease in natural forest cover from 27% in 1957 to 2% in 1982 and to 0.3% in 1995 [11]. The study also shows that between 1957 and 1995 about 99% of the forest cover was mainly lost to land cultivation, with an increase of 77% in cultivated land. This depicts a huge loss of biomass and soil carbon following land use changes [9,10,12]. Houghton et al. [13] reported that land use changes may account for 33% of the total anthropogenic carbon emission between the years 1850 to 2000. A study by Pan et al. [1] reported that about one petagram of carbon is emitted yearly due to tropical land-use change. Forest management may create a carbon sink through reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land or may result in a carbon source due to overexploitation [14][15][16]. Studies on forest carbon stock under different management regimes have shown inconsistent findings. While some studies report a loss of carbon stock following management activities, others show no detectable differences between managed versus unmanaged forests. For example, Achat et al.",
        "e82e3cff-58e7-4137-8a09-c0039c3c9eaf": "For example, Achat et al. [4] compared conventional with intensive harvesting using 284 forest sites and found a 22% loss of carbon in the forest floor carbon following conventional harvesting. However, no significant differences were reported in the lower soil layers. Hoover [17] found no significant differences between three different forest management scenarios (unthinned, minor thinning, and heavy thinning) in both the forest floor and soil carbon. Certainly, the intensity and management type (ranging from light thinning to clear cut), as well as the thinning interval determines the impact on the carbon pools of forests [18]. Increasing the forest area and implementing sustainable forest management practices are important cost-effective options for climate change mitigation [19,20]. Sustainable forest management helps to sequester carbon and provides timber and fuelwood, a renewable energy source. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies three types of climate mitigation options in the forestry sector, namely afforestation, reforestation, and reducing/avoiding deforestation [21]. This suggests activities for reducing emissions from land use change, as it is included in the climate mitigation objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [22]. At the UNFCCC 2005 meeting, this topic was negotiated and activities were put forward that are known under the term REDD (REDD-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+, the latter of which explicitly adds the role of sustainable forest management and its role for carbon management in developing countries. REDD+ has gained enormous attention in many developing countries, including Ethiopia since it is also seen as a financial mechanism to improve the environmental conditions by avoiding deforestation and promoting reforestation/afforestation programs [23]. The implementation of REDD+ will also lead to social and environmental benefits by providing timber for various purposes and supports biodiversity conservation [24]. According to these political goals, in 2011 the Ethiopian government developed a Climate Resilient and Green Economy (CRGE) strategy to transform the economy by 2025 [25,26].",
        "2a38e051-86fa-46b1-9edc-7a6993329137": "The plan aims for protection of the environment and to decrease the CO 2 emissions. In Ethiopia, about one third of the emissions come from forestry (55 Mt CO 2e of the total 150 Mt CO 2e in 2010) [26] and 50% are the result of deforestation. Under CRGE, the government has set a target to reforest 7 million ha by the year 2030. The National Forest Sector Development Program of the recent national REDD+ Strategy [27] has set a target of 16.1 Mha reforested land by 2030, which would double the current forest area in Ethiopia. Land use conflicts (crop production, grazing, infrastructure etc.) and uncertainties in user rights [28] may impose serious limitations for successful reforestation activities. Planting activities may compete with food security [29]. Many Ethiopian farmers convert their crop land to plantations due to the growing market for construction and fuelwood [30]. Today, Eucalyptus sp. L'H\u00e9r. accounts for about 90% of Ethiopian plantations and studies show that these Eucalyptus sp. plantations strongly affect the soil conditions, the ground water, the wetland areas, and the biological diversity [31][32][33]. Thus, experts are increasingly pushing the government to ratify rules that ban Eucalypt plantations on cropland, along rivers, lakes, and in wetland areas. As a result, the current Ethiopian REDD+ implementation strategies focus on (i) the reforestation of grass and shrub land areas; (ii) the enhancement of agroforestry practices with indigenous species; and (iii) sustainable forest management of the remaining natural forests [26,34]. The remaining natural forest areas, even though they are often degraded, are banned from human intervention [11,16,35] as they are highly important for implementing the CRGE strategy of the Ethiopian government. Information from available studies in Ethiopia focuses on the aboveground and soil carbon stock of current forests using plot level information [14,15].",

Since forests are an important source of fuel and construction material for the local population, we include (a) three different thinning scenarios and (b) five different rotation lengths (10,30,50, 100, and 150 years), assuming a so called 'Normal-forest' system (equal representation of every age class). No climate change scenarios are considered, though, because of the high additional uncertainty different climate change trajectories would cause over such long simulation periods, when one purpose of this study is to compare the impact of different rotation lengths. As a diagnostic tool, we chose the process-based biogeochemical (BGC) ecosystem-flux model Biome-BGC to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of reforestations in different agro-ecological zones, for different current land uses, and under different forest management options. The model was chosen because it simulates forest growth and soil development by simulating major carbon, nitrogen, and water pools in fluxes in response to climatic and soil variables and different forest management options. In a previous study, the model had been tested and evaluated with measured vegetation carbon, soil carbon, and net primary production (NPP) data across different agro-ecological zones (across elevation, temperature, and precipitation gradients) within the Amhara region [10]. The main working steps can be summarized as follows. (i) Identifying the potentially suitable reforestation areas; (ii) predicting the soil and aboveground carbon sequestration potential in different agro-ecological zones according to different land use types; and (iii) assessing management impacts (thinning and rotation length) on the forest soil and aboveground carbon stocks.",
        "794d1fac-f7c4-40c9-9696-2fb664e88654": "The Amhara region in Ethiopia has an estimated area potentially suitable for reforestation of about 3.4 million ha or 22% of the total land area (Figure 2). Considering the current forest coverage of about 250,000 ha, which is less than 2% of the Amhara region [14], the potential is great and reforestation in the region could substantially contribute to the suggested REDD activities within Ethiopia. Note that Amhara represents 14% of Ethiopia's land area but could contribute around 20% of Ethiopia's 2030 target for afforestation with 16.1 Mha [27]. Any successful implementation of the proposed potential reforestation areas will depend on a practical implementation plan. We suggest the implementation of the Normal-forest approach (e.g., equal share of area by age according to a pre-defined rotation period) and improvements of the forest management regulations and a clarification of the forest user rights [28]. Furthermore, important factors determining forest productivity and thus carbon sequestration potential are (i) site elevation and the associated climatic conditions; (ii) initial land use as an indicator for soil degradation; as well as (iii) forest management [69][70][71][72]. In Amhara, the Midlands (elevation range from 1800 m to 2300 m) and especially the Highlands (2300 m to 3200 m) are the most productive, but also highly populated areas, versus the sparsely populated Lowlands (500 m to 1800 m) and Alpine areas (>3200 m). Our recommendations in focusing on reforestation activities at elevations between 1800 m and 3200 m is in line with common practices since already established forest plantations are mainly in the Midlands and Highlands [11,73]. Aridity and frequent fires limit forest growth in the 'Combretum-Terminalia woodland and wooded grassland' of the Lowlands (see Figure 2 and Equations ( 1) and ( 2) for Aridity index, a measure for water stress).",
        "31fe42f7-b1db-42df-b51a-6aafe4b70646": "Forest plantations in this Lowland vegetation belt would be jeopardized by severe water stress, followed by salinity problems, by free livestock grazing [74] and a dense layer of tall grasses. Drought together with a dense grass layer promotes forest fires in the Lowlands, which may occur several times per year [38]. Thus, only so called 'exclosures' [15,75], which are fenced and guarded areas with natural regeneration and no or reduced grazing may help to restore the woodland areas in the Lowlands [76]. Unfortunately, it is especially the Combretum-Terminalia woodlands that are suffering from recent deforestations [27]. Within the determined suitable elevation belt for reforestation in Amhara region, the Highlands show higher NPP and aboveground as well as soil carbon stocks versus the Midlands (Tables 234). These productivity variables are also higher on wet versus dry sites, for example, agro-ecology 'wet' vs. agro-ecology 'dry'. This indicates that the climatic condition in the Highland-wet zone induces less drought stress and favors vegetation growth [77]. Another observed effect is the trend in the contribution of soil carbon storage to the total storage across the moisture gradient. Both in Midlands and Highlands, and similarly for all initial land use types, the contribution of net soil carbon stock to the total net carbon stock is highest in dry conditions (compare Tables 3 and4). Dry conditions result in a reduction of forest growth and the decomposition processes, the former leading to lower aboveground carbon storage, the latter to higher carbon accumulation in the soil. The estimated 3.4 Mha of ecologically suitable reforestation areas include different current land use types, namely, 0.7 Mha (Million hectares) of bare land, 1.2 Mha of grass land, and 1.5 Mha of shrub land (Figure 2). The land use distribution follows regional topographic conditions and climatic patterns (Figure 1).",
        "25db4409-3989-4214-a1fd-b7bc97f4d959": "The land use distribution follows regional topographic conditions and climatic patterns (Figure 1). This confirms previous findings from several studies [38,[78][79][80], which demonstrated that the crop production and other farming activities (grazing etc.) follow vegetation patterns and thus are a constraint by ecological growing conditions. Although differences among agro-ecological zones (Tables 3 and4) may be more pronounced than differences between the three land use types, interesting differences in soil and above ground soil carbon sequestration among the three land use types could be revealed. Under comparable climate conditions, reforestation on bare land exhibits lower productivity rates (NPP and aboveground carbon storage) (Tables 2 and3) versus the other land use types. We can expect that these sites have experienced the highest degradation effects, as expressed by the lowest initial soil carbon and especially nitrogen stocks (compare Table 1). However, reforested areas on bare land showed the highest relative or net carbon and nitrogen gain (Figure 3) versus reforested grass land and shrub land (see Tables 3 and4). This suggests that the reforestation of bare land is not just important for avoiding further soil erosion but it is also the land use type where the highest net soil carbon gain can be expected. The highest net carbon gain of the aboveground biomass can be expected for reforested areas on shrub land and grass land, versus bare land (Tables 3 and4). These areas are often highly populated and replanting activities in these areas would address the high demand for fuel wood and timber. Some existing small-scale plantations could already show that this is possible, providing more timer and fuel wood for the local population and reduced pressure on the remaining forests [34]. In our study, we identified 1.2 Mha of grassland suitable for reforestation; however a potential land use conflict should not be ignored. Grass land is mainly used as a feed source for livestock. A study by Tschopp et al. [81] in the highlands of Ethiopia showed that more than half of interviewed farmers (58%) grazed their animals on communal grass land.",
        "d10a9316-6fca-4804-b0d1-d65cfcc4386c": "Livestock numbers and thus the demand for grazing land increases with an increasing population [81] while grassland is increasingly converted to crop land, either illegally or legally by government initiatives to feed the fast growing Ethiopian population (2.5% increase per year) [82]. Any successful reforestation project must be simple and should include a forest management plan that integrates harvesting options. Forest management strategies that address both the local people's wood demand and a maximum carbon sequestration potential are an effective incentive for large-scale reforestation programs [83]. Therefore, we analyzed three thinning scenarios (unthinned, thinning 1-5% every 20 years, and thinning 2-10% every 20 years) and a Normal-forest system with different rotation lengths. In all applied thinning scenarios, the aboveground and soil carbon stock increased compared to the initial stock (Figure 3), indicating a gain in soil fertility (Figure 3). Thinning allows the harvest of a certain portion of biomass [18]. Lowered stand density reduces competition, improves the light conditions, and activates decomposition processes, which leads to higher individual growth rates. Note that the thinning impact on the soil conditions by scenario is negligible (Tables 3456). An important conceptual goal of our study was to provide a long term implementation path for establishing sustainable forest management, including options for a sustainable production and continuous wood supply [84] for the farmers in the region. Practical considerations at the beginning of a large reforestation program need to involve the limitations in the production of planting material, education, and limitation in the work force [85]. Furhtermore the weather conditions at the time of and preceding the planting activity planting are important (i.e., to avoid local droughts and only plant when soils are well saturated). In our study we suggested to expand the planting activities over several years. This helps to organize the logistics but also establishing the proposed 'Normal-forest' system. This approach will also provide a patchy forest landscape of different development stages, which favors biodiversity [86].",
        "18721b28-0f98-4e08-939a-5ca8fa82dfc5": "We provide examples (see Table 5) for the expected gain in biomass by different rotation lengths and land use forms. It is clear that the rotation length will affect both the gross and the net aboveground carbon stock (AboveC NF in Table 5), and therefore the total sequestration potential of reforestation in Amhara (see Table 6). The current CO 2 emissions from forestry are estimated to be 55 Mt CO 2e year -1 [26], which is an equivalent of 15 Tg C year -1 . Our proposed reforestations in Amhara have the potential to sequester between 159 Tg C (thinning 2) and 177 Tg C (no thinning) within 100 years (100 year rotation Normal-forest system, compare Table 6). This would balance more than 10% of the annual CO 2 emissions from forestry or around 4% of the total emissions in Ethiopia. Prolonging the rotation period to 150 years increases the carbon sequestration by 5-6%, depending on the thinning intensity. Clear cutting and replanting the forest stands after 50 years would reduce the sequestration potential to less than 2% of the emissions from the forestry sector. It is important that if the potential reforestation area is reforested according to the 'Normal-forest' approach (step wise annual reforestation of an area calculated as the total potential area divided by the chosen rotation length), any further net carbon sequestration from that forest area can only be attributed to the soil (compare with Figure 3 and Table 3), because the areas where trees are cut and replanted is equal. Beside the replanting activities, a cascading use of wood should be promoted to build up an anthropogenic carbon storage pool with a considerable additional storage potential, where even a substitution for fossil fuel burning may be considered [87]. Thus, the fate of the cut timber decides the potential for additional carbon storage, whether the timber is burnt directly or whether the timber is stored in wood products.",
        "c37792ed-a353-40c7-a165-71245f83a6f5": "Higher above ground carbon stocks resulting from an increase in rotation length also lead to thicker trees and thus a wider potential use. While short rotation forestry, as is typical in private small-scale plantations of Ethiopia [88], mainly produces fuelwood, with increasing rotation length the production of saw timber will increase and more carbon will be sequestered.",
        "23a4fc78-0d10-49ba-a6dd-1c2d462b9dca": "Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO 2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO 2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO 2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO 2 ha -1 year -1 during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO 2 , with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO 2 ha -1 year -1 the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO 2 ha -1 year -1 during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO 2 ha -1 year -1 ). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions.\nConclusion:This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO 2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfilling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.",

Mangroves are found along the coasts of numerous tropical countries but only represent 0.7% of total tropical forested areas worldwide (Spalding et al. 2010). Owing to their unique position in the landscape and characteristic mix of biological communities, mangrove ecosystems offer a multitude of goods and services to the local biota and human population. These benefits include shoreline stabilization, storm protection, habitat and biodiversity protection, flood and flow control, sediment and nutrient retention, recreation, tourism, fishing, and forestry products (Furukawa et al.",
        "23452fe3-285e-42aa-bde8-a2e906d51244": "The international urge to plant an increasing number of trees for developing or restoring ecosystem services 2,5,6 leads to the question where to plant, which trees to plant and for what purpose to plant. Ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and provisioning of food, fodder, timber and water depend on different ecosystem functions and components. Therefore, the ability to predict such functions and services is of utmost importance to make a connection between restoration actions and goals. Here, we selected productivity (and related carbon storage) as an example for such ecosystem functions. We tested if community functional characteristics are relevant indicators in our search to maximize productivity of planted forests. We found that (1) the average effects of FD values on productivity became larger than the average effects of CWM values after 7 years of forest development, (2) the FD values became on average more reliable predictors of productivity than CWM values and (3) the effects of FD values were not dependent of the particular species within the community while the effects of CWM values were. In other words, our results demonstrate that using the average value of the species functional traits as community characteristic is not sufficient to make reliable predictions of productivity, in contrast to using the diversity of species trait values, especially as stands grow older. These results align with previous studies showing the benefit of diversifying ecological strategies for ecosystem functioning [37][38][39][40] and have large implications for the selection of tree species to be planted in restoration and other plantings, dependent on the specific goals (in this case, increase of productivity). Effects of CWM and especially FD values on cumulative long-term productivity became larger with stand age, as predicted. These larger effects may be partly due to growth differences among species and increasing tree-tree interactions 41 . A size-related growth advantage combined with more productive functional traits may enhance effects of CWM values. The larger and positive effects of FD values with stand age illustrate that processes such as resource partitioning, facilitation or trophic interactions may result in more benefits for tree growth in plots with high FD values than in plots with low FD values.",
        "55f50d98-e43c-44aa-ad6e-a1911a301353": "This is in line with previous studies illustrating that positive effects of species richness on productivity increase with time 12,[42][43][44][45] . However, these previous studies only found increasing statistical complementarity effects over time yet could not relate these effects to FD. Here, we could show that FD of a large number of individual traits that underpin productivity increases over time. After 10 years of forest growth, the average trait effect of one standardized trait unit of FD was 50.2 \u00b1 5.4 m 3 ha -1 while it was 34.5 \u00b1 6.4 m 3 ha -1 for CWM values. This means that the difference in stand volume between plots with the highest and lowest FD values was bigger than the stand volume difference between plots with the highest and lowest CWM values. Our model predicts that beyond 10 years of growth FD could become even more important relative to CWM values. Less likely, differences between FD and CWM might level off at a later point in time or extreme weather events might break the observed trends, which makes predictions for future decades challenging. The calculated productivity benefits of FD versus CWM community functional characteristics to a certain extent could have been affected by the spread of trait values among the locally available 40 tree species used in our experiment. However, the presented functional trait approach could in principle be applied to any forestry system with sufficient functional variation among a regional species pool. In addition to this, functional trait effects on productivity should be assessed in each particular context, specifically in terms of climatic and soil conditions. Reforestation success, in this case high stand volume, is determined by tree growth and survival and both can be influenced by functional traits [46][47][48] . This means that in addition to considering functionally diverse species, selection of species with high or low trait values can improve initial survival and thus forest establishment and success. In addition, especially for long-term goals, the ability of tree species and the whole community to be resilient against changing environmental conditions 49 , influence other ecosystem functions 8,9 and create economic revenue for local livelihoods 40 should also be considered in reforestation and restoration projects 7,50 .",
        "c2901e2e-1e7a-4666-9e37-1d37fc1c83ce": "Initially, CWM values had a higher reliability for predicting productivity of newly planted forests but with time FD values achieved a higher reliability of predicting productivity, as suggested. The occurrence of direct tree-tree interactions is crucial here 41 . In young systems with small trees the interactions are still weak and therefore the community-weighted average of all individuals (that is, CWM values) explains productivity well, as has also been found in other young-tree experiments 14,15,36,[51][52][53] . In older systems, when trees get bigger and tree-tree interactions get more intense, this may lead to stronger competition but it may also promote resource partitioning, facilitation and interactions with other trophic levels 41 . The fact that after 10 years of growth more than 75% of the plots had interacting tree crowns (Supplementary Fig. 5) shows that this may be happening already in most plots of our study. The increasing reliability, in addition to the increasing effects, of FD values on productivity in our study means that functional differences between the species are more important for productivity of species-rich communities over time and suggests that interactions such as resource partitioning and facilitation outweigh resource competition under such conditions. Therefore, creating plantations with high FD is beneficial. Nevertheless, FD is always limited to the extent that environmental filtering requires co-occurring species to be adapted to the particular site conditions. Yet, within this 'filtered' species set, choosing the most different species can reduce competition and increase complementarity and potentially facilitation. The reliabilities of individual CWM or FD traits to predict productivity may be seen as relative low (for example, on average 1.7 and 3.2% of stand volume for 10-year-old stands, respectively). However, the reliability of species richness to predict stand volume was not much higher (4.6%; Supplementary Fig. 1). Individual traits, such as the CWM and FD values of xylem water potential, explained more variation among plots in cumulative stand volume (16.2 and 10.2%, respectively), which suggests that variation in functional trait values can tell us more about the observed productivity than only the richness of species does.",
        "d7084fb4-5a0f-417b-81ab-1cd768b0fdc6": "We did not include multiple traits in the first step of our analysis to obtain R 2 values as metadata. While R 2 values from these regressions would have been higher, there would have been so many possible analyses that some combinations of traits might have yielded high R 2 to some degree simply by chance. Nevertheless, future studies may perhaps search for the best combination of explanatory variables in one set of plots and then test it in another set and repeat this many times to further optimize species selection on the basis of their trait combinations. Although reliability by single functional traits may be low, we want to emphasize that our study illustrates that when considering functional trait values, functionally diverse species instead of functionally similar species can promote productivity more reliably. In addition, considering the community functional trait values for forest management is relevant because it can be more easily manipulated than, for example, environmental conditions. We suggest that reforestation managers should avoid using functionally similar species that may maximize CWM and instead use communities composed of functionally diverse species to maximize FD within the limits permitted by the environment and thus promote long-term productivity and associated ecosystem functions. In addition, forest managers can also consider guiding existing monoculture plantations towards more functionally diverse plantations by selectively harvesting and replanting to create and maintain high productivity over longer time spans. Although our results suggest that functional diversity (that is, FD values) among species reliably predicts productivity when plantations get older, observational studies performed in older natural forests indicate that CWM values may be more reliable than FD values for prediction 26,51,54 . However, many of these natural forests were characterized by low species richness and evenness, allowing dominant species to drive CWM values and productivity and thus cause a correlation between the two, which is in line with the mass-ratio theory [25][26][27] . Obviously, in this situation functional diversity is low by definition and FD values are even close to zero as in the case of monoculture plantations-in which only intraspecific variation can contribute to FD-and can therefore not be important in predicting effects on productivity.",
        "f7c9dd9c-d1c3-4e05-888c-8e63e611c9a8": "For FD values to have effects on productivity, in line with the diversity hypothesis 29,30 , a certain species richness and evenness in forest communities is required. Our study shows that, if this is indeed the case, FD of species trait values becomes more relevant than the average value of species traits. We argue that this is mainly due to the intensification of species interactions such as resource partitioning, facilitation and interactions with other trophic levels 41,42 . Against our hypothesis, we observed that effects of CWM values on productivity differed among the ten different species-pool subsets, while in accordance with our hypothesis, effects of FD values did not. This is an undesirable feature of CWM values because it means that communities with the same single-trait CWM value do not have the same effect on productivity if communities are made up by different species. A reason for this could be that communities of different species composition with the same CWM value of a trait may still vary in the FD value of that trait or even vary in CWM or FD values of other traits and thus their effect to predict productivity varies. In other words, trait effects can be trait-context dependent, meaning that different combinations of trait values can result in similar successful ecological strategies 55 that in this case maximize productivity. Although multivariate ecological strategies may be expected to better explain observed performances, we found little evidence for this (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, it could also be that only community functional characteristics are just not sufficient to predict general patterns of ecosystem functioning, as indicated by findings of van der Plas et al. 24 . Nevertheless, our study shows that considering the functional traits of species is still useful to consistently and reliably predict productivity when focusing on differences rather than average values of species traits. The effect and the reliability to predict productivity (both accumulated stand volume and annual stand volume increment) varied among trait groups depending on stand age. The differences were more pronounced at later stand age, except for reliabilities of CWM values. After 10 years of growth, FD values of hydraulic traits had the largest effect and the highest reliability to predict productivity.",
        "9a336323-b57f-4ca5-bcfc-bea77410cc02": "Specifically, FD values of maximum xylem hydraulic conductance had the largest effect (one standardized unit increased stand volume by 135.7 m 3 ha -1 ) and xylem water potential had the highest reliability (10.2%) to predict accumulated stand volume. In addition, CWM values of xylem water potential had the largest effect (163.6 m 3 ha -1 ) and the largest reliability (16.2%) to predict the volume of 10-year-old stands. CWM values of xylem water potential also showed a consistent effect on accumulated stand volume independent of species pool, in addition to the consistent effect of their FD values. This suggests that xylem water potential, an indicator of hydraulic drought strategies 56,57 , can be an important species trait for forest managers. For example, forests with high FD values for xylem water potential can reach high productivity when water availability is fluctuating across years, while high CWM values can promote productivity when the overall climatic conditions become drier and species need better hydraulic drought strategies in general. Due to biophysical and evolutionary constraints, it may be difficult for a single species to apply both strategies. Traits that are most commonly used across various studies (indicated by ref. 24 ) did not predict stand volume better than other traits (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that an unbiased exploration of possible traits is necessary to discover important traits for forest productivity. Root traits have not been included in this study, although they may greatly affect water and nutrient acquisition that drives productivity 58 . In future studies it would be good to simultaneously include above-and below-ground traits to better represent the combination of strategies that can reach high community productivity or other ecosystem functions. It is conceivable that explanatory power of multivariate FD would have increased if root traits could have been included in our analyses. Independent of the traits used in this study, we suggest to consider species that are functionally different instead of functionally similar for species selection. This goes beyond the most practiced species richness application (that is, simply increase the number of species) and is in line with recommendations to combine species with diverse ecological strategies [37][38][39][40] .",

This is highly relevant because functional traits may convey more general information on the drivers of the biodiversity-productivity relationships 22,60 than species richness alone. This functional information translates to goal-oriented species selection during restoration and reforestation 61,62 . In most restoration projects monocultures are planted 6 while scientists across the world have shown that governmental policies will fail in their endeavour to restore ecosystem functioning and mitigate climate change if they keep on focusing on monoculture plantations [4][5][6] . Our study emphasizes the need for restoration and reforestation projects to consider functionally different species that together promote productivity, especially when these projects have long-term goals. This is in line with increasing evidence that species mixtures, specifically with a diversity of ecological strategies [37][38][39][40] , will provide better and more stable forest ecosystems than single-species forests 8,9,12,63,64 . In addition to naturally regenerate and protect forests 6,50 , planting forests with high FD is imperative to improve forests ecosystem functioning and mitigate climate change.",

In 1983, UNDP and UNESCO established a regional project concerned with the value of mangrove ecosystems in Asia and the Pacific. This international initiative led to an increased appreciation of the value of mangroves and a subsequent upsurge of mangrove restoration efforts (Field, 1996;Kairo et al., 2001). Some of the objectives driving early mangrove reforestation efforts include: wood production for timber, poles and fuel wood; fisheries productivity; coastal protection against storms, and legislative compliance (Ong, 1982;Field, 1996;Saenger, 2002). The rationale for mangrove restoration has changed very slowly over the years from just silviculture to recognition of mangroves as a diverse resource. The term 'restore' is taken to mean the creation of a sustainable functioning mangrove ecosystem that may or may not resemble its precursor at the very same site. The early attempts at mangrove restoration met with mixed results with some being successful, while others were doomed from the start (Field, 1996;Erftemeijer and Lewis, 1999). Most of these attempts were not based on well-understood ecological principles and well-defined aims. In more recent times, attention has turned to the ecological processes present in natural and restored mangrove systems (Alongi, 2002;Saenger, 2002;Lewis, 2005;McKee and Faulkner, 2000). The relationship between the restored mangrove ecosystem and adjoining ecosystems, such as salt marsh (Santilan and Hasimoto, 1999) and seagrass beds (Hogarth, 2007) has also been a focus of attention. A consensus has emerged that an understanding of mangrove hydrology is most important for successful restoration (Wolanski et al., 1992).",

He pointed out that the focus on silviculture remained the primary objective of mangrove restoration and that few species had been involved and indicated that adequate data exists to enable successful mangrove restoration but emphasized that assessment of structural and functional characteristics of restored mangroves is imperative. This paper takes Ellison's review (Ellison, 2000) further and presents a comprehensive review of the data available on the functionality of restored mangrove ecosystems in respect to a number of functional indicators: vegetation structure, natural regeneration, productivity, nutrient recycling to conservation of inherent biodiversity and socio-economic valuation. Finally, it looks at the constraints and opportunities for successful mangrove restoration. Within the context of this review, functionality is used to refer to the ability of restored mangroves to process nutrients and organic matter, trap sediments, provide food and habitat for animals, protect shorelines, provide plant products and a scenic environment, in a similar fashion to natural mangrove forests. These aspects are often referred to as the goods and services that mangroves can provide (Walters et al., 2008).",

Ambitious restoration targets have been set for tens to hundreds of millions of hectares in tropical forest regions at the national, regional, and international scales (e.g. Bonn Challenge, Initiative 20 \u00d7 20 in Latin America, Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact in Brazil; Chazdon et al. 2017). But the high costs of forest landscape restoration present a major obstacle for widescale adoption. For example, the implementation phase alone can cost upwards of US$3,700 per hectare in Brazil (Molin et al. 2018), and international financing for such efforts is limited compared to the large area proposed for restoration (12 M ha in Brazil alone). Restoring tropical forests requires more than just compensating landowners for the use of the land. It demands substantial investments in the implementation, maintenance, and long-term protection and monitoring of recovering forests (Brancalion et al. 2017;Reid et al. 2018). Hence, tropical countries need to develop innovative, financially-viable approaches to forest restoration that are not heavily dependent on external aid that can stimulate large-scale application to reach scale (Ding et al. 2017). One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand (Putz et al. 2012). From an ecological perspective, forest restoration projects should prioritize planting native tree species. However, fast-growing, exotic species comprise a potential alternative, if they can help offset planting costs, do not inhibit the recolonization and growth of native species, and speed up the recovery of forest functions (Ashton et al. 1997;Lamb, Erskine & Parrotta 2005;Catterall 2016). Extensive production knowledge and established timber markets for certain exotic tree species may transform restoration plantings into a profitable activity and create investment opportunities (Brancalion et al.",

Several studies have found abundant and diverse regeneration of native woody species in the understory of commercial tree plantations across the global tropics (e.g. Brockerhoff et al. 2013;Pryde et al. 2015;Wu et al. 2015), and highlight the potential of timber plantations to promote large-scale forest restoration (Lugo 1997;Parrotta, Turnbull & Jones 1997). However, we are not aware of any controlled or replicated experiments that rigorously assess the ecological and economic outcomes of interplanting commercial exotic species with a diverse suite of native species to facilitate regeneration of a diversity of tropical forest species and offset restoration implementation costs by harvesting exotic planted trees. Exotic eucalypts, planted for wood pulp and timber, are ubiquitous in tropical regions, and currently cover over 20 million hectares globally. Only nine out of >700 Eucalyptus and Corymbia species (hereafter referred to as \"eucalypts\") comprise >90% of the global planted area (Stanturf et al. 2013). The prominent environmental concerns associated with the large plantation area and ecological characteristics of exotic eucalypts have motivated several studies to assess their biodiversity value, allelopathic effects, water consumption, and potential for invading unplanted areas (Bremer & Farley 2010;Stanturf et al. 2013;Becerra et al. 2017). The effects of eucalypts vary, however, with regional climate, previous land use, and plantation management practices (Brockerhoff et al. 2013). Eucalypts are grown in Brazil mostly for pulp, but also for round logs, sawn lumber, firewood, fencing poles, and oil (IBA 2018). Such flexible uses and high productivity (Brazil's average: 35 m\u00b3 ha -1 yr -1 , but reaching >60 m\u00b3 ha -1 yr -1 in some regions) make eucalypts popular commercial trees for farmers (Goncalves et al.",
        "2807560a-02a7-4182-b6bd-edf390df83c1": "2013); hence, eucalypts comprise 71% of tree plantation area in Brazil (5.7 Mha, IBA 2018) and are widely used in plantations throughout Latin America (Geary 2001;Salas et al. 2016). Most of these plantations have been intensively managed in short rotations (~5 yr) and as extensive monoculture areas, which have prevented the natural regeneration of native woody species and resulted in so-called \"green deserts\" (Bremer & Farley 2010). However, less intensively managed and abandoned eucalypt plantations in many regions host a high diversity of plants and birds (Silva-Junior, Scarano & Cardel 1995;Marsden, Whiffin & Galetti 2001;Lopes et al. 2015;C\u00e9sar et al. 2017). Forest restoration projects in Atlantic forest region of Brazil mostly plant a high diversity of native tree species (Rodrigues et al. 2011;Brancalion et al. 2018), but the Native Vegetation Protection Law of 2012, allows for intercropping exotic, commercially-valuable tree species with native species in restoration projects to meet restoration requirements . The justification for this legislative change from the earlier 1965 Forest Code was the need to transform restoration into a financially-viable land use (Brancalion et al. 2012), which compensates farmers for the opportunity costs of foregone agricultural land use. Here, we draw on results from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to rigorously assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on aboveground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration, and costs. This information is important to evaluate the ecological and financial viability of this novel legal norm and its potential for dissemination to other global regions to leverage tropical forest restoration.",
        "38a1822f-dce0-48bf-9731-83650756edfc": "Our results show that mixing plantations of eucalypts and native trees is a promising restoration strategy to help offset restoration implementation costs without undermining the ecological outcomes. The growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected (1 site) or slightly reduced (2 sites) by eucalypts prior to logging despite the greatly enhanced biomass production of mixed plantations. Moreover, the richness of regenerating native woody species was not reduced by eucalypts either before or after eucalypt logging, yet the abundance of regenerating native species was higher in native plantations in sites 1 (pre-logging) and 3 (post-logging). The most evident difference between native and mixed plantations was the short-term difference in AGB accumulation. With nearly nine times higher AGB stocks prior to logging, mixed plantations clearly demonstrated the value of integrating eucalypts as a transitional phase in restoration if wood production is one of the expected outcomes (Amazonas et al. 2017;Lamb 2018). The fact that the impressive biomass accumulation of eucalypts did not strongly reduce the growth of planted native non-pioneer trees may be due to the naturally slow growth of this group of species (Chazdon 2014) and their adaptation to tolerate low to medium light conditions (Loik & Holl 1999). We lack plantations of exclusively non-pioneer trees to disentangle competition in these systems. We had anticipated that the fast growth of eucalypts would result in higher canopy cover and consequently less grass cover than native plantations. In contrast, we found the opposite result for canopy cover in one site and no difference in another, and no impact on grass cover in either site. These unexpected results can be explained by the contrasting architecture of the tree crowns of eucalypts and native species. The eucalypt species used in the experimental plantations have monopodial branching, which concentrate leaves at the top of plantation canopy and result in a leafless midstory (Almeida et al. 2019).",
        "9527a057-7217-461c-95b6-119c43cb6e68": "2019). On the other hand, native plantations usually have branches and leaves throughout all the forest vertical strata to maximize light absorption by species with different ecophysiological behaviors and niche requirements (Sapijanskas et al. 2014). The shade levels in both plantations types appeared to be sufficiently high to prevent grass regrowth in the understory, a major barrier for restoration success in the Atlantic Forest region. A valid concern about interplanting eucalypts with native species is that the impacts of falling trees and dragging logs could largely destroy the native non-pioneer trees interplanted with eucalypts and the abundant natural regeneration of the understory. In fact, the visual impression right after logging was that all regenerating individuals were destroyed in eucalypt planting lines, where logging impacts were concentrated (Fig. S3). In site 3, nearly half of planted non-pioneer trees were damaged by logging; but most broken trees resprouted and damaged trees survived seven months after logging, resulting in negligible mortality levels. The species richness of regenerating woody plants was similar between logged mixed plantations and native plantations a few years after logging, but the abundance of regenerating individuals was reduced in both logged and unlogged mixed plantations in site 3 compared to native plantations. We had expected planted native non-pioneer trees would grow faster in the post-logging period, given that seedling growth is commonly light limited in plantations (Paquette, Bouchard & Cogliastro 2006) and tropical secondary forest (Chazdon et al. 1996), but growth post-logging growth rates were similar in logged and unlogged treaments. In site 3, the potential benefits of greater light availability may have been counterbalanced by the higher levels of physical damage of logging to planted native non-pioneer trees. The lack of differentiation of regenerating communities both in terms of species richness and composition, may reflect the spatial proximity of the plots.",
        "a89d089a-527e-4e7c-a077-6a1351dddff5": "Although we used large experimental plots (2,160 and 1,080 m\u00b2), compared to those traditionally used in restoration experiments (Shoo & Catterall 2013), seed dispersers may have been attracted to the heterogeneous forest structure and abundant animal-dispersed trees of the experimental site in general (Reid, Harris & Zahawi 2012). This local enhancement of seed dispersal could mask the differential potential of native trees, especially of pioneers, to attract seed dispersers, yet some studies have reported diverse bird communities in the understory of abandoned eucalypt plantations in the Atlantic Forest region (Marsden, Whiffin & Galetti 2001;Lopes et al. 2015). Differences in both aboveground biomass accumulation and natural regeneration were much more strongly affected by site factors than by planting treatment. The nearly three-fold higher tree growth rates at site 3 likely reflect more favorable soil and climate conditions (site 3 vs. site 1: soil sum of bases: 23.81 vs. 1.93 mmol c .dm -3 ; clay content: 71.4 vs. 20.9%; annual rainfall: 2,191 vs. 1,412 mm; Table S1) and less intensive prior land use (extensive pasture vs. intensive eucalypt plantation). The greater species richness of recruits in site 3 may be explained by those factors, as well as higher landscape forest cover (20.8% vs. 6.3%) than site 1. All three factors have been demonstrated to affect the rate of tropical forest recovery in prior studies (reviewed in Holl 2007;Chazdon 2014). Eucalypt allelopathic effects (Becerra et al. 2017), cases of invasion (Tererai et al. 2013), reduction in soil moisture (Robinson, Harper & Smettem 2006) and problems with wildfires (Moreira & Pe'er 2018), have been reported predominantly in drier climates.",

We did not find any evidence of natural recruitment of eucalypts in our plots. Data from a related study at our sites (Amazonas et al. 2017) showed minimal differences in soil volumetric water content in shallow soil layers (up to 1.3 m depth) of ~4.5-yr native, mixed, and eucalypt monoculture plantations. This lack of difference in soil water availability may be due to the fact that most native pioneer species also require large amounts of water to sustain their fast growth (Filoso et al. 2017). As expected, eucalypt logging resulted in a valuable contribution to offset ~45-75% of restoration implementation and maintenance costs. Harvesting eucalypts or other commercially valuable native or exotic trees in restoration could partially overcome the financial barrier for adopting active restoration approaches, which can cost up to ten times more than natural regeneration (Shoo et al. 2017), but are needed in many cases due to low site resilience (Rodrigues et al. 2011;Shoo et al. 2016). Exotic eucalypts can thus become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies (Catterall 2016). Together, our results suggest eucalypt use as a transitional stage in restoration has a neutral effect on natural regeneration and can help offset restoration costs along with complementary strategies that aim to transform restoration into a competitive land use, like payments for ecosystem services and harvesting valuable native timber species in long rotations (Brancalion et al. 2017).",

Some landowners and surrounding residents would like to restore native forests on some of these lands for the valuable products and services they provided prior to mining. For these lands to become productive forests, intervention is needed to loosen compacted mine soils, correct chemical or nutrient deficiencies, and replace the current vegetation. Reforestation guidelines to restore native forests on mined lands that are unoccupied, unmanaged, and unproductive were developed. Practices include land clearing, mine soil tillage, fertilization, tree planting, weed control and monitoring. The recommended practices were tested on a 35-ha mine site, originally reclaimed to grassland and bond-released in 1997. After the second growing season mean stocking of 885 ha -1 was achieved. Five of the six primary planted species (black, white, and red oak, tulip poplar, black cherry) had statistically equivalent stocking, but tulip poplar and black cherry had the highest mean height and biomass. Volunteer trees occurred on most measurement plots; most volunteer trees were native but invasive shrubs were also present. The pre-existing vegetation proved to be persistent and competitive, demonstrating the importance of vegetation control and strategic nutrient application to reforestation success.Under leadership provided by the Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative, a group formed by the Office of Surface Mining and seven state regulatory authorities, these procedures have been adopted and applied by watershed improvement groups, forestry and fish/wildlife agencies, coal companies, environmental groups, and an electrical generating company pursuing carbon credits.",

Today, these lands are largely unmanaged and covered with persistent herbaceous species, such as fescue and serecia lespedeza, and a mix of invasive and native woody species with little commercial or ecological value. Some landowners and adjacent publics would like to restore native forests on some of these lands for the valuable products and services they provided prior to mining. Re-establishing productive forests on otherwise unused and non-productive mined lands will generate economic value for landowners and communities, and will enhance environmental quality by accelerating restoration of ecosystem servicessuch as watershed protection, water quality enhancement, carbon storage and wildlife habitatthat are typically provided by native forests on non-mined landscapes. Today, lands being actively mined in several Appalachian states are often reclaimed using the Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) (Burger and Torbert, 1992;Burger et al. 2005), which establishes productive forest as a post-mining land use in accord with SMCRA. In 2004, the Office of Surface Mining and the seven state regulatory authorities in Appalachia created the Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative (ARRI) to advocate and promote the use of this FRA to reestablish healthy, productive forest habitat in the eastern coal fields (Angel et al., 2005;Burger et al., 2005). The reforestation guidelines in this publication are different; they are intended for lands mined and reclaimed without the FRA that are not forested and not under active management. They are intended for application on unused mined land, including those acres mined since 1980, reclaimed to satisfy SMCRA guidelines, bond released, and now under landowner control. Land mined before 1980, some of which has been identified as \"abandoned mined land\" could also be reforested using these guidelines.",

We attribute this effect to the vigor of the herbaceous competition, given that soil properties are at levels considered favorable to planted trees based on expectations from active mine plantings (Emerson et al. 2009). This shows the need for aggressive control of existing vegetation using multiple strategies beginning with the application of a multi-spectrum herbicide to kill undesirable woody trees and shrubs and many types of herbaceous species. Based on observations of broadcast fertilized and unfertilized areas (outside the experimental area) of the site, the herbaceous competition was stimulated by the applied fertilizer making it all the more difficult to control with post-planting weed control methods. Even if pre-planting herbicides had been applied, a germinating herbaceous seed pool will still create a near-total herbaceous ground cover, but, compared to already established grasses and legumes, its juvenile condition is controllable with post-planting herbicides. The aggressive growth of the existing ground cover stimulated by broadcast fertilization illustrates the importance of applying fertilizer in narrow bands in the tree row, or as fertilizer pellets adjacent to each planted tree seedling as recommended in the guidelines (Burger and Zipper, 2010). Emergence by planted trees from the thick groundcover of grasses, the non-native legume Lespedeza cuneata, and invading herbaceous plants such as Aster sp. is a critical ecosystem development stage, as emergent trees gain competitive advantage over herbs by casting ground shading. The correlation of competition and browse ratings suggests an indirect herbaceous effect via preferential attractiveness of dense and vigorous herbs to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a prominent local browser. With low survival (43%), the average planted-tree stocking of 884 trees ha -1 was less than the 1000 ha -1 targeted in the restoration plan. Stocking varied, but planted trees occurred in all plots and was distributed over the site.",
        "ed4211c2-cbad-4e58-9216-4deafe17e348": "Stocking varied, but planted trees occurred in all plots and was distributed over the site. If they survive, we would expect a mixed-species forest with a desirable component of mid-and late-successional species by crown closure and beyond. Natural invasion by native trees can also aid in forest restoration. Most observed volunteer trees were early-successional native-forest components that, except for black locust, are desirable given our reclamation goals. Volunteer stocking, however, was highly variable across the site. N accumulation is an essential ecosystem process after extreme disturbance, and dominance by N-fixing species on early-successional disturbed lands is common (Bradshaw 1983;Finegan 1984). Two prolific woody species, autumn olive and black locust, are N fixers; both likely remained on site as live roots and viable seed despite the restoration treatment. Although native and an appropriate site occupant at this successional stage, black locust is not seen as desirable for our restoration goals because its rapid growth in thickets often inhibits site occupation by slower-growing forest trees, causing arrested succession (Groninger et al. 2007). Black locust is an exotic invasive elsewhere (ISSG 2010). Proliferation of autumn olive, also an exotic (ISSG 2010), appears to be driving some ecosystem development processes. Invasion by a strongly competitive alien is common on disturbed sites with productive soils (Prach and Hobbs 2009). We consider it likely that its density variations are driven by pre-disturbance distributions as no other site influences are apparent. The positive correlations of planted tree biomass and height with autumn olive cover suggest a response to autumn-olive cycled N, a finding that is consistent with such effects in tree plantations (Pashke et al. 1989;Pedlar et al. 2006). With mean height >2x planted trees, rapid growth, and typically broad and dense crown, autumn olive has the potential to overtop and outcompete planted trees.",
        "f7f84b47-2806-4377-aeb6-9c2643243125": "Our data demonstrate that effect at higher densities, as planted tree stocking correlates negatively with autumn olive cover when cover is >5% (\u03c1=0.63, p=.02), while planted stockings for 3 plots with >11% autumn olive cover are among the 6 lowest recorded. The correlation of planted tree growth with autumn olive cover may also have been due to similar responses to unmeasured soil conditions. Soil pH was correlated with planted tree height and NBNV stocking (Table 4). These findings, combined with known mine soil property effects on active mines' reforestation success, suggests mine soil properties may be influencing site's response to restoration treatments. In the Appalachians, mine soils with moderately acidic pH's (~5-6.5), low SS, and low CF% are generally favorable to planted tree growth (e.g. Showalter et al. 2007;Angel et al. 2008;Emerson et al. 2009) and to site invasion by native volunteers (Angel et al. 2008). Two years after treatment, the restoration is progressing; some areas appear to be reverting to autumn olive and black locust dominance due to prolific stump sprouting. Pre-restoration plant communities and soil properties appear as primary influences on restoration progress to date. Managing these dynamics is especially challenging on older mine sites where, unlike new sites with freshly constructed soils, a plant community, many of which are non-native and exotic, are already in place and able to influence ecosystem development unless intentionally suppressed. Timely, judicious, herbicide treatment, before (broadcast spray) or after (stump treatment) mechanical removal of aggressive, undesired species, may be required. Prior research demonstrates that soil tillage to alleviate compaction will increase survival and growth of trees planted on previously reclaimed Appalachian coal mines (Fields-Johnson et al. 2008;Skousen et al. 2009). Soil density and nutrient deficiency mitigation, however, can also stimulate the preexisting plant community making it more competitive.",

Mine soils are commonly deficient in essential nutrients, especially N; planted trees require these nutrients to emerge from competition, but broadcast applications may have stimulated that competition which was largely responsible for the low initial survival of the planted trees. Strategic nutrient applications targeted to planted trees, such as band application in the ripping row and/or as pellets in the rooting zone, may increase planted trees' survival and early growth while minimizing stimulation of herbaceous competition. Herbicide application prior to site clearing could also slow competition from site occupants capable of live-root propagation. These results suggest that strict adherence to the timing and order for applying the sequence of reforestation practices is important for reforestation success. Pre-and post-planting control of competitive, existing vegetation is critical; nutrients added to improve forest productivity must be applied in ways that do not exacerbate the proliferation of unwanted vegetation.",

Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems.

Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offset all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11 yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1 AE 0.4 Mg C\u00c1ha \u00c01 \u00c1yr \u00c01 ).

Of these ecosystem services, perhaps the most discussed in recent international discourse is the significant role that mangroves and other \"blue carbon\" habitats such as seagrass beds and tidal saltmarshes can play in climate change mitigation and adaptation through counterbalancing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Despite their importance, mangroves are undergoing substantial declines in extent, habitat quality, and intactness through a range of land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) drivers, including the conversion of mangroves to agriculture and aquaculture ponds (Richards andFriess 2016, Thomas et al. 2017). Aquaculture expansion in Southeast Asia requires the clearing of mangroves and construction of ponds, which are often abandoned and left in a state of disuse because many ponds typically exhibit a productive life span of between 3 and 10 yr after construction (Giesen et al. 2006, Bosma et al. 2012). Disused ponds provide little economic or food productive value and deprive communities of the vast array of ecosystem goods and services that healthy mangrove forests and sustainably managed aquaculture provide. The rehabilitation of disused aquaculture ponds has the potential to bring back functioning mangrove habitats and their ecosystem services, including carbon (C) sequestration through both the production of biomass as forests redevelop and the burial of C in mangrove sediments (Alongi 2014). To date, the majority of mangrove rehabilitation projects initiated have focused on largescale and low-diversity donor-funded planting projects, which have had mixed success despite significant investments (Barbier 2006, Primavera andEsteban 2008). Most attempts fail completely or fail to achieve stated goals (Bosire et al. 2008) principally through planting of inappropriate species on unsuitable sites (Primavera andEsteban 2008, Kodikara et al.",

Ecological mangrove rehabilitation (EMR), in contrast, is a technique that prioritizes the restoration of hydrological regimes to facilitate multi-species recruitment of mangrove seedlings enabling establishment at natural tidal inundation levels (Lewis 2005, Brown et al. 2014, Lewis and Brown 2014). Aside from greater diversity, recruits tend to exhibit higher rates of growth and ascertain greater biomass over time resulting in more stable systems with greater degrees of ecological functionality than artificially replanted sites. Large-scale mangrove rehabilitation by improving hydrological connectivity through techniques such as EMR has been successfully achieved in Florida, USA and Latin America since the 1980s, (Lewis and Gilmore 2007) and since the early 2000s has been increasingly trialed in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia (Djamaluddin 2007, Oh et al. 2017), Thailand (Matsui et al. 2010), and Singapore (Friess 2017). Many of these rehabilitation projects have been accompanied by extensive monitoring and in some cases collaboration with researchers and academic institutions (e.g., Indonesia and Singapore). Thus the research progress of EMR is now relatively advanced, and such knowledge has been translated into practitioner field manuals (Lewis and Brown 2014). The aim of this study was to compare and contrast the relative rehabilitative progress from the EMR of disused aquaculture ponds in differing geomorphic settings and assess the degree to which C loss has been offset through regrowth in the context of LULUCF. We focused on two contrasting locations in Sulawesi, Indonesia, where EMR has been undertaken: Tanakeke Island and Tiwoho (Fig. 1, Table 1). Both locations share a similar management history of clearance and conversion to aquaculture ponds followed by subsequent disuse before the initiation of EMR activities in 2005 (Tiwoho) and 2010 (Tanakeke).",

Tanakeke is an oceanic atoll exhibiting low growth, low diversity, and shallow coralline sandy substrates while Tiwoho is a high growth, high diversity, riverine influenced system with deeper organic soils. We (1) compare and contrast stand structure, biomass, soil properties, and ecosystem C stocks and (2) assess carbon stocks as a function of LULUCF through reference to disused aquaculture ponds and intact reference forests (analogous to conditions pre-EMR and upon reaching maturity, respectively). This provides a framework to gauge the relative progress of rehabilitation at EMR sites and recovery of C stocks over time. Biomass accumulation within EMR sites is also assessed within a global context of developing mangrove forests for comparison. We hypothesized that the geomorphic setting and biophysical attributes of Tiwoho's EMR sites facilitate conditions more conducive to successful rehabilitation compared to Tanakeke, and that the full degradation of barriers to hydrological connectivity such as pond walls is crucial to maximize regrowth potential.",

Our understanding of leaf and tree-level physiology is built into a variety of process models and can be convincingly applied across a broad range of environmental conditions (Running, 1994;Aber et al., 1993). Furthermore, the influence of stand replacing disturbances can be accounted for by including forest age class distribution in spatially distributed models (Law et al., 2004;Turner et al., 2007). However, the influence of partial disturbance, such as forest thinning, is overlooked in most spatially distributed process models aside from its implicit contribution to forest type classification.In the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, thinning has been a major form of forest disturbance for over five decades. As a silvicultural tool, thinning is widely used to increase tree-level wood production, reduce fire risk, increase resistance to pests, restore old-growth structure, and to a lesser degree, supply biofuels for local energy plants. With growing concern over wildfire and increasing demand for domestic energy sources it seems likely that the extent of thinning will increase in the region.The response of tree and stand-level bole wood production to thinning is well documented in the region (Oliver, 1972) and there is a growing body of literature documenting the effects of various thinning and underburning prescriptions on growth efficiency",

These forests consisted of three distinct types: evergreen, seasonally deciduous and widely spaced gallery woodlands (Morellato and Haddad, 2000). They ranged from 48 to 328S and covered a total of 1.2 million km 2 (SOS Mata Atla \u02c6ntica and INPE 2008). Relicts of this once great expanse of forest still rank among the 25 most important international areas for biodiversity, supporting >20,000 species of vascular plants. Forty percent of these plants are endemic, representing 2.7% of the planet's total (Mittermeier et al., 1999;Myers et al., 2000). Deforestation continues to convert remaining patches of Atlantic forest to agricultural and urban land uses at a rate of 0.5% per year (Brooks et al., 2002;SOS Mata Atla \u02c6ntica and INPE 2008). At present, only 7.6% of the original Atlantic Forest remains intact (Tabarelli et al., 2005;SOS Mata Atla \u02c6ntica and INPE 2008). In some cases, if a seed source is available, native rainforest are able to re-establish naturally on abandoned agricultural lands (Lamb, 1998). This process, however, is slow (Finegan, 1996;Martins and Engel, 2007). In many places, even where an adequate seed source is present, soil compaction, nutrient depletion, and competition from introduced C 4 grasses prevent seedlings from ever establishing (Engel and Parrotta, 2001;Parrotta and Knowles, 2001;Doust et al., 2008;Laliberte \u00b4et al., 2008).",

Although seedling survival and growth are essential prerequisites to reclaim abandoned agricultural land, they are no guarantee that a self-perpetuating rainforest will develop. Speed is essential to achieve full canopy development in order to minimize surface desiccation during the normal dry season, and to permit roots to reach depths where moisture is available to sustain trees through periodic droughts. Canopy development differs among the native forests of the Atlantic area. Trees grow faster and develop a denser canopy in favorable than in unfavorable environments. For this reason, the canopy leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for reference in assessment of techniques designed to re-establish rainforests (Waring, 1983). The amount of nitrogen accumulated in a forest canopy is also a useful measure of its photosynthetic capacity (Chapin et al., 1987). Competition for light and other resources reduce the growth efficiency of individual trees. A good measure of Only 7% of the once extensive forest along the eastern coast of Brazil remains, and much of that is degraded and threatened by agricultural expansion and urbanization.

Intensive management increased seedling survival from 90% to 98%, stemwood production and leaf area index (LAI) by $4-fold, and stemwood production per unit of light absorbed by 30%.

This general expectation did not happen in our experiment (Fig. 1a, Table 2), also observed by Delagrange et al. (2008). The classification of Brazilian native tree species in different successional groups is based on Budowski (1965), and the theory of gap dynamics on tropical forests. When a gap is generated at a forest canopy, and the sun reach ground level changing micro-   climate within, the first species that re-colonize the area are pioneers (shade intolerant) and then, after canopy closure, nonpioneers (Withmore, 1990). On our restoration plantation the species showed different growth patterns from that proposed by Budowski. Therefore, the application of his classification method was not adequated to characterize the succession class of the species under restoration plantation conditions, where the environment is distinct from a gap dynamic inside the natural forest (Lugo and Lowe, 1995). In a degraded area, light-, thermal-, nutritional-, water-and competition-stresses may influence the behavior of the species under traditional-and intensive-silvicultural practices (higher and lower stress levels). The purpose of higher pioneer proportion was to provide a shade environment for the non-pioneer species (shade tolerant), resulting on early canopy closure and inhibition of weeds, catalyzing the restoration process (Parrotta et al., 1997;Lamb, 1998;Florentine and Westbrooke, 2004). Because the response did not reach such expectations, and the development of both pioneer and non-pioneer proportion was equivalent, the species were reclassified according to their behavior under restoration plantation conditions as fast, intermediate and slow growing (Table 1), to guide species selection for future forest restoration of Atlantic Forest, as done by Sampaio et al. (2007).",

Besides that, the use of less pioneers (50%) should be recommended due to the higher proportion of long-lived non-pioneer species, which will increase the forest biodiversity (Kageyama et al., 2003). Until the second year, DB was twice as much on denser spacing due to the higher stocking (3333 trees ha \u00c01 versus 1667 trees ha \u00c01 ), leading to more stem biomass accumulation at the last year (13.0 Mg ha \u00c01 versus 10.3 Mg ha \u00c01 ). However, after the third year DB became similar, imposed by a higher level of competition among trees (Fig. 1b), dropping the LUE under intensive silviculture (Fig. 5), probably due to higher LAI (Table 2) associated with a strong competition for water during the dry season (Henskens et al., 2001). In this study (Fig. 1b) and similar to Henskens et al. (2001) and Grant et al. (2006), achieve similar growth rates with lower stocking would have great implications on forest restoration activities, reducing seedling demand, decreasing plantation costs and increasing economic viability (Engel and Parrotta, 2001;Lamb et al., 2005). The interaction between stocking and silviculture, for DB and LUE (p < 0.0001, Fig. 5), denote an important practical application of this study. At 3 m \u00c2 1 m spacing, both levels of silviculture had equivalent DB (1.5 Mg ha \u00c01 semester \u00c01 ), but for the 3 m \u00c2 2 m spacing, intensive management obtained 9.4-fold gain over tradi-tional (4.7 Mg ha \u00c01 semester \u00c01 versus 0.5 Mg ha \u00c01 semester \u00c01 ). In terms of LUE, 3 m \u00c2 1 m is 2.6-fold more efficient when managed traditionally, while on 3 m \u00c2 2 m, intensive manage overcome traditional 3-fold.",
        "6f792268-9067-483f-a543-24212bcf2813": "These results show that wider spacing is totally dependent of intensive practices of silviculture (reduced environmental weed-induced stress) to achieve expressive gains on DB and LUE. When managed traditionally, trees at wider layout cannot occupy the site satisfactorily to the point of suppress colonization of weeds and consequently avoid competition for resources. Denser plantations intensively managed, despite no competition with weeds, show competition among trees due to higher LAI, and high demand for water during the dry season, reducing the LUE (Fig. 5). Intensive silviculture, with high rates of fertilization and weed control, are widely applied on forest plantations for cellulose and wood production (Gonc \u00b8alves et al., 2004;Stape et al., 2004), increasing aboveground net primary production from 20% to 90% (Giardina et al., 2003;Stape et al., 2006). On the opposite, silvicultural practices applied on native forest plantations aiming restoration of degraded lands receives usually low level of investment (Carpenter et al., 2004;Souza and Batista, 2004;Sampaio et al., 2007), due to the lack of a tangible commodity and an infinite growth period. Poor weed control, on dominated C 4 grass pastures, and none or low fertilization rates are not able to reduce environmental stress satisfactorily, resulting on high rates of mortality and ineffectiveness (Engel and Parrotta, 2001;Doust et al., 2008). Therefore, we tried to transfer the silvicultural technology of Eucalyptus wood production plantations to restoration plantations, reducing stress caused by weed competition and impoverished soils. Our results strongly refute the preconception that fertilizing native trees planted for restoration would be a waste of money and resources (Carpenter et al., 2004). Stemwood productivity under intensive management was considerably higher since first year (2folds), reaching almost 5-fold at third year (Fig. 2).",
        "1b8db5ee-ebc5-42ac-9c0a-21a8dfdba797": "2). The expressive gain in DB was a consequence of improved canopy structural and nutritional characteristics, with 3.7-fold more APAR (higher LAI) and 2.5-fold more canopy nitrogen, resulting in a 29% increase of the efficiency of converting APAR into stemwood biomass (Table 2). For commercial plantations, several studies obtained increase on productivity, improvements on canopy characteristics and enhance on efficiency of conversion PAR into biomass, with intensification of silvicultural management and alleviation of environmental stress (Beadle, 1997;Loik and Holl, 1999;Stape et al., 2008), and it seems that restoration forestry can use such concepts to increase the longterm success of recovering degraded areas. According to the fertilization rates used, up to the second year, both traditional and intensive treatments received similar amounts of nutrients. Therefore, the 4.4-fold gain in DB induced by the intensive management at this age can be credited exclusively to the control of C 4 grasses, and must be visualized as a required practice (Lugo et al., 1990;Parrotta et al., 1997;Souza and Batista, 2004). Nevertheless, after the second year, the intensive silviculture effect is confounded between weed control and fertilization. Fertilization is need for satisfactory development of forest restoration plantations (Florentine and Westbrooke, 2004), especially on highly degraded and depleted soils (Funk and Vitousek, 2007). The great responsiveness of these selected 20 species to intensive silviculture management (Fig. 6), open a new opportunity for the development of successful long-term restoration strategies for native species (Parrotta and Knowles, 2001). Indeed, as a consequence of this study, a parallel study using 120 Atlantic Forest species under intensive management, in the same Research Station, was installed in 2007 in order to provide an adequate restoration responsiveness classification for the Atlantic Forest species (Stape, 2008).",

Synthesizing the existing knowledge on functional trait-based restoration is thus a timely and important challenge. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess how ecosystem services are associated to functional traits across organisms, ecosystem types, and continents. We also assessed the existing trait-based frameworks to target ecosystem services in restoration ecology. Then, we discussed future perspectives for the field, especially the challenges of applying trait-based frameworks in megadiverse tropical ecosystems, which have ambitious restoration commitments. Most papers focused on plants (72%), terrestrial habitats (69%), and non-tropical ecosystems (68%) and monitored ecosystem services and functional traits after restoration started rather than using them as previous targets. Only 12% of the papers targeted the restoration of both services and traits a priori, and 3.8% presented a clear trait-based framework to target ecosystem services in restoration. The possibility of selecting alternative subsets of complementary species in their provisioning of ecosystem services should make functional restoration more feasible than traditional approaches in species-rich tropical ecosystems. With this review and our critical insights on the perspectives of applying functional trait-based restoration widely, we hope to assist broad-scale restoration programs to obtain higher levels of benefits for nature and human well-being per unit of area undergoing restoration, going beyond the areabased approach that has dominated restoration commitments.",
        "71cf5219-2d2d-40c1-9639-165ddefa99ba": "Ecological restoration usually focuses on restoring species composition of pre-disturbance communities (Engst et al. 2016) either by reintroducing targeted native species or by favoring their spontaneous recolonization on degraded sites (Rodrigues et al. 2009;Chazdon & Guariguata 2016). Restoration programs usually rely on the premise that the increased abundance of species typically found in reference ecosystems would support the recovery of key ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, soil protection, and water supply (SER 2004;Wortley et al. 2013;Laughlin 2014;Kollmann et al. 2016). However, recent metaanalyses on restoration success have demonstrated that either species composition or ecosystem services have not been fully recovered (Crouzeilles et al. 2016;Moreno-Mateos et al. 2017;Shimamoto et al. 2018). Incomplete recovery might be explained by a lack of an explicit approach to restore ecosystem services, which are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems, such as provisioning (e.g. fresh water), supporting (e.g. nutrient cycling), regulating (e.g. climate regulation), and cultural services (e.g. recreation) (MEA 2005). Biodiversity drives ecosystem functions that underlie ecosystem service (MEA 2005) provisioning by influencing ecosystem processes that directly or indirectly affect energy and material flows (D\u00edaz et al. 2015). Here we consider that every ecosystem function is an ecosystem service by its direct or indirect effects on ecosystem benefits to humans. If the loss of ecosystem services is a major concern in a world facing severe global changes (MEA 2005;IPBES 2019), services must be explicit targets in restoration programs (Ehrenfeld & Toth 1997;Funk et al. 2008;Montoya et al. 2012;Wortley et al. 2013;Laughlin 2014;Perring et al. 2015;Engst et al. 2016), and not only consequences of interventions guided for achieving other goals.",

However, a recent literature review found that most (52%) restoration project objectives have not explicitly considered ecosystem services (Kollmann et al. 2016). Although several papers and assessments have emphasized this need (e.g. SER 2004;MEA 2005;Montoya et al. 2012;Brancalion & Holl 2016) and some frameworks linking traits and services have been proposed (Laughlin 2014;Laughlin et al. 2018;Rayome et al. 2019), a clear framework on which services to consider and how to restore them using species traits is still missing (Kollmann et al. 2016), especially for broad-scale restoration. Therefore, the stability of communities over time and the services provided by restored ecosystems to support human well-being, especially under global changes, may be compromised. Operationalizing ecosystem services as targets for restoration is still a major challenge (Kollmann et al. 2016), and the selection of species to attain target services is not trivial because multiple species may support several ecosystem services (Lavorel & Garnier 2002;D\u00edaz et al. 2007). Knowing which species combination to reintroduce to restore ecosystem services while maintaining a stable restored community is a challenging task (Laughlin 2014;Laughlin et al. 2018). Traditional approaches to consider ecosystem services in restoration programs involve direct measurement of abiotic and biotic components (SER 2004). However, quantifying abiotic features hardly enables a clear association of ecosystem service and species composition, which has led ecologists to look at more meaningful and predictable parameters such as functional traits (Liebsch et al. 2008;Suganuma & Durigan 2015;Laughlin et al. 2017;Brancalion et al. 2018). A common approach has been to classify species into \"functional groups\" a priori, and then trust that reintroducing members of each group would restore the targeted ecosystem services (Perring et al. 2012).",
        "d1f2b259-655b-4a05-a874-c5f7374fbf1e": "2012). Nonetheless, a priori grouping of species into \"functional groups\" has several shortcomings. First, the performance of a species in a given functional group may be context dependent, as the performance of a function may be determined by trait-environment interactions (Brancalion et al. 2019a). Second, a species may belong to more than one functional group, and thereby perform several services in varying degrees (D\u00edaz et al. 2007). Third, the link between species and ecosystem services is mediated by effect traits, that is, those that impact ecosystem processes (Lavorel & Garnier 2002;Violle et al. 2007). Species have multiple effect traits that contribute independently or jointly to ecosystem services (Gamfeldt et al. 2008). Therefore, the effect of multiple species on different ecosystem services is more a multivariate continuum than a scenario with species classified into discrete functional groups. Fourth, by separating species into functional groups a priori, one may at best confirm an arbitrary decision rather than interpret how species relate to functional trait patterns a posteriori, which may provide information on which species contribute more to different ecosystem services. Because of the limitations to operationalize the use of traditional approaches of ecosystem service recovery by ecological restoration, new directions have been proposed in the literature (Funk et al. 2008;Laughlin 2014). The claim for a new paradigm on ecological restoration demands a comparison on the advantages and disadvantages relative to the traditional paradigm (Table 1). Although restoration ecology studies have increasingly considered ecosystem services, on-the-ground restoration programs often experience difficulty applying biodiversity and ecosystem service theory in concert with the traditional restoration approach (Aerts & Honnay 2011;Kollmann et al. 2016;Naeem 2016). An alternative would be to use species effect traits clearly related to ecosystem services (Lavorel & Garnier 2002;Funk et al. 2008). An advantage of trait-based approaches is that they enable the assessment of the relationship between community assembly and ecosystem functioning (Laughlin 2014).",
        "be62edf6-f987-46db-973c-2cdbdc083557": "This advantage exists because functional traits are two-sided coins in which \"function\" can be related either to response to community assembly processes mediated by abiotic and biotic interactions or to effect on ecosystem services (Lavorel & Garnier 2002;Violle et al. 2007;Suding et al. 2008). Functional traits may be classified into \"soft traits,\" that is, those that are easy and quick to measure, and \"hard traits,\" that is, those that are harder to measure (Hodgson et al. 1999). Hard traits are usually more closely linked to mechanistic processes, but as they are hard to measure for a great number of species, they are usually replaced by soft traits that might be relevant to such processes. For instance, seed mass is a soft trait because it is relatively easy to collect and process seeds to get dry mass values, and at the same time represents correlated functions harder to measure, such as competition versus colonization abilities at initial stages of development (Turnbull et al. 1999). Functional traits may be related to mechanisms of community assembly such as competitive hierarchies (Keddy & Shipley 1989), limiting similarity (MacArthur & Levins 1967) and environmental filtering (Kraft et al. 2015). They can also relate to processes explaining how dominance of traits (i.e. mass ratio hypothesis, Grime 1998;and priority effects, Weidlich et al. 2018) or diversity of traits (i.e. niche complementarity, Tilman et al. 1997) influences ecosystem functioning. While the information on how traits affect ecosystem services relates to the biotic and abiotic components at an ecosystem-level framework, approaching how traits mediate community assembly mechanisms may provide information on community stability and resistance to environmental changes (Laughlin 2014). The advantages of the trait-based approach for restoration rely, however, on the availability of information on functional traits for the species used in restoration projects (Table 1). Such shortcoming makes the use of a trait-based restoration especially challenging for species-rich tropical ecosystems, because the existing knowledge on functional traits is still concentrated in temperate species (Hortal et al.",
        "227de091-8ef1-4ab2-b978-e2076267ed71": "2015). Moreover, in tropical regions, there are many taxonomic uncertainties due to high species richness, lack of surveys, and overall low scientific development (Karlsson et al. 2007;Hortal et al. 2015;Wilson et al. 2016). Consequently, there is a lack of basic taxonomic, ecological, and physiological information for a great number of native species in the tropics, making it hard to recompose species composition of originally mega-diverse tropical communities. This knowledge gap is an important barrier for the ambitious restoration programs planned for the upcoming years, which have a clear focus on supporting human well-being through the recovery of ecosystem services in degraded landscapes worldwide, but especially in the tropics (Brancalion et al. 2019b). Synthesizing the existing knowledge on functional trait-based ecological restoration is imperative to transform the potential of this conceptual approach into more successful onthe-ground projects, fostering research to new directions that may better match the demands of restoration practitioners. The central goal of this article is to assess the progress made in ecosystem service-and trait-based restoration. For this, we systematically reviewed the literature on restoration ecology (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017). Although we did this review for all kinds of ecosystems, we had a special focus in tropical ecosystems, which have the most pressing needs to advance with the inclusion of a trait-based approach to guide restoration. Specifically, we answered: (1) is there an increasing trend of published studies on ecological restoration which evaluate ecosystem services and functional traits? (2) how often have ecosystem services and functional traits been used as targets for ecological restoration in general and across continents? (3) are there biases related to target organism, ecosystem type, and geography in the literature towards some ecosystem service type and functional trait? (4) what are the most common approaches of using ecosystem services and functional traits in restoration: a priori or a posteriori? (5) which functional traits are used to evaluate different ecosystem services in ecological restoration?

However, we found a series of biases in functional restoration research. If someone were to randomly pick a study from a pool of restoration studies, the selected study would be most likely about restoration of plants in forests outside the tropics in a developed country. Furthermore, there would be a good chance that the study evaluated functional traits, but most likely it would merely monitor trait variation along time with no clear relation to ecosystem services or to prior specific restoration targets. Ecosystem services were more rarely evaluated, and mainly in terrestrial, non-tropical ecosystems. Although many international restoration commitments have been made by tropical developing countries harboring speciesrich ecosystems, these countries lack restoration ecology studies considering functional traits, and, especially, ecosystem services. Our findings corroborate the observation made by recent studies about the lack of biodiversity studies in tropical ecosystems in developing countries (Wilson et al. 2016;Clarke et al. 2017). Our results indicate that the most concerning region is Africa, with a large area, high biodiversity, serious threats to native ecosystems, high demand on ecosystem services, and few studies.

Note that all the papers on ecosystem services are under the category \"ecosystem services,\" not only those that studied exclusively services. The same applies for the category \"functional traits,\" and for \"a priori\" versus \"a posteriori\" comparisons. Moreover, the category \"Ecosystem services + functional traits\" represents the intersection (not the union) of studies on services and traits. Therefore, summing up values of the table does not result in 100%.",

More specifically, our results indicate that, while the number of studies differ substantially, the proportion of studies that consider services, traits, or both is similar between developed (North America, Europe, Australia) and developing regions (South America, Africa). Despite this relative consistency across continents, studies evaluating services were more common in temperate forests, while those assessing traits were more common in temperate grasslands and relatively common in tropical forests. Our results suggest we need more functional restoration studies in the tropics, especially in tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and coniferous forests, but also in tropical forests. These studies should include functional traits, and whenever possible, ecosystem services. As we found no studies evaluating cultural or provisioning services in the tropics, it would be interesting that future studies attempt to assess these kinds of services. Our finding that most studies used services and traits a posteriori indicates monitoring of services and traits after restoration started is still much more common than their use before the beginning of restoration projects. The use of traits to target services before the start of restoration should be encouraged as a way to pursue the recovery of services in restored ecosystems (Laughlin 2014). Moreover, several of the studies did not evaluate trait functionality properly; they merely used traits as a separate dimension from taxonomic or phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity without a clear mention to what the function meant. In order to ensure scientific rigor and higher predictability on the success of ecosystem service recovery, it is important that the relation of traits to ecosystem functioning and services be clear upfront in restoration projects. What Are the Existing Trait-Based Frameworks to Target Ecosystem Services in Restoration? A common approach among the trait-based frameworks for targeting ecosystem services in restoration was to use the classic theories of community assembly (Brudvig & Mabry 2008;Bochet & Garc\u00eda-Fayos 2015), biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Perring et al. 2012;Mahaney et al. 2015;Ostertag et al. 2015), or both together (Funk et al. 2008;Laughlin 2014).",

Laughlin (2014) proposed a quantitative model to use trait values for targeting ecosystem services in restoration. For instance, species with dense woods and low specific leaf area might be selected to provide the restored community with resistance to future dry conditions; functional trait diversity might also be prioritized. Laughlin's approach was the only to enable the adjustment of species abundances to functional goals of restoration. An important point that only four papers explicitly addressed was the trait-based selection of species from regional and habitat species pool (Brudvig & Mabry 2008;Laughlin 2014;Bochet & Garc\u00eda-Fayos 2015;Ostertag et al. 2015). Assessing the functional structure of the habitat species pool at a regional scale may provide alternative candidate species that are functionally similar. Other frameworks focused on selecting species based on functional traits to restore functional redundancy and complementarity in plant-pollinator networks (Devoto et al. 2012), assure primary succession and phytostabilization on soils degraded by mining (Ilunga et al. 2015), and promote natural regeneration under semiarid conditions using nurse species traits (Navarro-Cano et al. 2016). More recently (beyond our systematic review time frame), novel quantitative trait-based approaches for restoration of ecosystem services have been published. Laughlin et al. (2018) proposed a framework that enables selecting species for restoration to achieve convergent trait value targets and simultaneously maximize functional trait diversity. Rayome et al. (2019) proposed a framework and computer program to select species from regional pools based on the interpretation of multivariate trait patterns, which should enable practitioners selecting functionally redundant or complementary species based on restoration goals. Tsujii et al. (2020) developed a framework that enables selecting species for restoration from species pools to maximize   functional richness and redundancy simultaneously as proxies for multiple ecosystem services and resilience with the minimal possible set of species.",

Nevertheless, we consider we still miss a unified approach that simultaneously enables the trait-based selection of species from regional/habitat species pools and the definition of relative abundances of the selected species to achieve the provisioning of target ecosystem services. Challenges to Put Trait-Based Frameworks for Restoration in Practice at Broad Scales A major challenge for a trait-based restoration in the tropics (and elsewhere) is the lack of knowledge on functional traits of native species (Aerts & Honnay 2011). Establishing linkages between traits and services is still a major challenge in the ecological literature as a whole and has important implications to restoration ecology. We showed some patterns on how traits and ecosystem services are related in the restoration literature, which might help prioritize future studies. For instance, food provisioning might be targeted in tropical forest restoration, and the edibility of fruits or seeds might be used as a trait to achieve the delivery of this service in the restored ecosystem. In order to help practitioners put in practice a trait-based restoration to recover ecosystem services, we provided a summary of linkages between plant functional traits and target ecosystem services that are more consolidated in the literature. Ideally, functional traits might be available for the whole regional species pool relative to the sites to be restored. Some functional traits, like performance, whole-plant, and diaspore traits, are relatively well studied in the tropics, while others are less studied. In a major compilation of trait data, Petisco-Souza et al. ( 2020) found major gaps of information for key functional traits of 2,236 tree species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest after searching in global plant trait databases, specialized books, regional datasets, and digitized plant specimens: 88% for seed mass; 85% for specific leaf area; 53% for wood density; and 16% for maximum height.",

Taxonomic and functional information needs also to be constantly reviewed and updated to accomplish the goals of functional restoration. A good example of broad-scale standardization of taxonomic nomenclature exists for Brazil: the database of the Brazilian Flora 2020 project (Forzza et al. 2012). This database compiles the accepted scientific names and basic biological information of more than 46,000 species of plants, algae, and fungi and is frequently updated by more than 400 experts (http://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/ jbrj; accessed 24 Aug 2020). Considerable effort has already been made in research groups working in tropical countries for gathering functional traits as well, and data have been made available in major databases such as TRY Plant Trait Database (Kattge et al. 2020) and Botanical Information and Ecology Network (Maitner et al. 2018), besides several regional databases. Ecosystem services and functional traits are increasingly being used in ecological restoration, although too few studies have considered them for ecological restoration in the tropics. Trait-based frameworks are useful for broad-scale restoration in the tropics because they may help circumvent common limitations of restoration in developing megadiverse countries (e.g. lack of saplings or trait information) by enabling considering alternative sets of species of the regional pool leading to similar resolutions of target services. While funding for tropical research is impaired and more complete datasets are not available, we advocate the use of the best existing ecological theory and available data in trait-based models to select species sets that will enable the restoration of ecosystem services.",

However, estimates of carbon-offset potential are currently based on data from natural mangrove forests, potentially leading to overestimating the carbon-offset potential from restored mangroves. Here, in the first study of its kind, we utilise 210 Pb sediment age-dating techniques and greenhouse gas flux measures to estimate blue carbon additionality in restored mangrove forests, ranging from 13 to 35 years old. As expected, mangrove age had a significant effect on carbon additionality and carbon accretion rate, with the older mangrove stands (17 and 35 years old) holding double the total carbon stocks (aboveground + soil stocks; ~115 tonnes C ha -1 ) and double the soil sequestration rates (~3 tonnes C ha -1 yr -1 ) than the youngest mangrove stand (13 years old). Although soil carbon stocks increased with mangrove age, the aboveground plant stocks were highest in the 17-year-old stand. Mangrove age also had a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, with the older mangroves (\u226517 years) releasing one-fourth of the CH 4 emissions, but double the CO 2 flux compared to young stands. Our study suggests that the carbon sink capacity of restored mangrove forests increases with age, but stabilises once they mature (e.g., >17 years). This means that by using carbon sequestration and emissions from natural forests, mangrove restoration projects may be overestimating their carbon sequestration potential.",

Mangrove ecosystems are globally recognised as one of the most efficient natural carbon sinks, able to capture and store carbon, particularly in their soils, for millennial time-scales (Donato et al., 2011;McLeod et al., 2011). A growing effort to measure, map, and estimate the potential of mangrove ecosystems to offset carbon emissions (Atwood et al., 2017;Hutchison et al., 2014;Jakovac et al., 2020;Macreadie et al., 2021;Richards et al., 2020;Rosentreter et al., 2018a;Sanderman et al., 2018) has increased many nations' interest in 'blue carbon' (carbon captured and stored by coastal ecosystems) as a strategy to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (Herr and Landis, 2016;Seddon et al., 2019). By protecting, planting and rehabilitating mangrove ecosystems, nations' can directly offset their carbon emissions, as well as enhance additional ecosystem services such as coastal protection, fisheries, and recreation (Adame et al., 2015;Barbier et al., 2011;Locatelli et al., 2014;Su et al., 2021;Wylie et al., 2016). While there has now been substantial research on carbon stocks and sequestration rates from established mangrove forests (Atwood et al., 2017;Donato et al., 2011;McLeod et al., 2011;Sanderman et al., 2018;Serrano et al., 2019), there has been relatively less research on rates of carbon accumulation from restored mangrove ecosystems. This is an important gap to fill because recent restoration reviews suggest aboveground plant biomass can take decades to reach equivalence to established forests (O'Connor et al., 2020;Sasmito et al., 2019a).",
        "d2928ab9-96e7-461a-bb69-a26ac6b9df52": "In this way, we might expect that soil carbon sequestration rates and, thus soil carbon stocks take time to reach equivalence to established forests (e.g., Marb\u00e0 et al., 2015). Having information on the early soil sequestration rates and aboveground plant biomass is important if we are to accurately estimate the blue carbon gains under restoration scenarios. The implementation of mangrove rehabilitation projects for carbon offsetting requires accurate estimates of the net carbon gains resulting from mangrove restoration activities, such as planting. Monitoring carbon during or after rehabilitation can be performed with several methodologies, each measuring different carbon pools and processes (e.g., Verified Carbon Standard; Verra, 2021). Mangrove plant biomass generally increases with time and reaches equivalence with natural forests after about 40 years (Sasmito et al., 2019a). However, data on change in soil carbon stocks in rehabilitated mangrove sites show no clear trend (Sasmito et al., 2019b). This is likely due to the experimental approach utilised by many studies in which the carbon stocks from 1 m soil cores (or another standardised depth) are compared between sites of different age (Adame et al., 2018;Osland et al., 2012). Moreover, it is often hard to decide at which soil depth to sample to accurately capture the restoration period, and in fact may be sampling soil present prior to rehabilitation. Thus, a more accurate approach to quantify carbon additionality due to mangrove restoration is to compare the carbon stocks or accumulation rates before and after mangrove rehabilitation/establishment (Downes et al., 2002;Quinn and Keough, 2002). If the restoration activity is about to occur, monitoring can be performed by repeated visits measuring living biomass, soil accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions before and after the rehabilitation action takes place (Verra, 2021). If the rehabilitation has occurred in the past, soil carbon accumulation since rehabilitation could be detected using sediment age dating (e.g., 210 Pb) in conjunction with measures of soil carbon stocks (Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018;Marb\u00e0 et al., 2015).",
        "838c8d27-c5ee-4077-94bb-6f350e68f992": "Given the time constraints of most studies, and the time-sensitive need to inform current policy, sediment age dating has become a powerful tool to understand how historical restoration efforts have increased soil carbon stocks (Greiner et al., 2013;Marb\u00e0 et al., 2015). An increasing number of studies has investigated the fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 from mangrove forests, demonstrating that the emissions can reduce an average of 20% of the carbon stored in their soils (Cameron et al., 2019a;Rosentreter et al., 2018a). Data show carbon emissions are influenced by tidal inundation and invertebrate burrows, but also positively correlated with deforestation and changes in land use (Bulmer et al., 2017;Cameron et al., 2019b;Castillo et al., 2017;Gillis et al., 2017;Grellier et al., 2017;Lang'at et al., 2014). However, we still have relatively little data on emissions from mangrove forests that have been rehabilitated (but see Cameron et al., 2019a), and even less on if these emissions change with the age of the mangrove forest. Here, we investigate a temperate mangrove forest from southeast Australia that was planted and then expanded across the embayment over 35 years. Using historical information, aerial imagery, and 210 Pb age-dating techniques, we established a space-for-time approach to compare carbon additionality since mangrove establishment across three forest stands of different age within the same embayment. We specifically contrast: (1) aboveground organic carbon stocks, (2) soil carbon stock and accumulation rates since establishment, and (3) carbon fluxes (CO 2 and CH 4 ). We predict that blue carbon additionality will be tightly coupled with plant-soil development over the 35 -year-age of the three sites, with carbon accumulation rates increasing and carbon fluxes decreasing with mangrove age.",
        "adedae30-5417-4ab2-b28d-2e415e6a19a9": "Restoration projects using mangrove ecosystems to offset carbon emissions require data on how carbon dynamics (balance between carbon sequestration and emissions) change as mangrove forests develop over time. This case study from Australia's temperate mangroves suggests that the age of the forest influences several carbon cycling metrics. We found that soil carbon sequestration rates were half for mangroves (13 years) compared to older mangroves (17 and 35 years). There was an increase in aboveground carbon biomass between the 13and 17-year-old mangrove forests, with the 35-year-old stand actually showing lower biomass compared to the 17-year-old stand. CO 2 emissions from the sediments were higher in the 17-and 35-year-old stands, but showed lower CH 4 emissions compared to the 13-year-old stand. These results suggest shifts in carbon sequestration (soil carbon accumulation and plant biomass) and emissions (CO 2 and CH 4 ) as mangrove forests mature. This information is critical to inform carbon offset projects, as it influences the net sequestration capacity of newly planted mangroves, and suggests we cannot use values from established mangrove forests as direct proxies for carbon dynamics within rehabilitated or planted mangroves. Instead, we may need to adjust the estimates from established mangrove forests based on data from case studies that quantify the multiple carbon pools in restored mangrove forests (Cameron et al., 2019a;Cormier et al., 2021). In this study, we utilised 210 Pb soil age-dating to estimate the soil carbon sequestration since mangrove planting and establishment, and found evidence that older mangrove forests have two times higher soil carbon accumulation rates than younger mangrove forests. This is an important finding, as few studies have quantified how mangrove stand age influences soil carbon accumulation in the time since restoration. Interestingly, the rates of carbon accumulation in the older forests are almost double that of the average of established mangrove forests across Australia (Australian average 1.26 + 0.9 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ; Serrano et al., 2019).",
        "6c691475-8688-4d12-923c-94f0d856be10": "As a consequence, we also found that older mangrove forests have accumulated greater total soil carbon stocks since rehabilitation. These are important data as increases in soil carbon stocks with mangrove age has been unclear due to the stock-change methods generally employed that compare carbon stocks down to 1 m between restoration sites. For example, the review by (Sasmito et al., 2019a) showed no significant relationship between mangrove forest age and soil carbon stocks probably due to a high spatial variability in the background soil carbon stocks and/or the disturbance of the soil stocks prior to restoration. Similar to \"before-after\" studies, it is best to use age-dating to determine soil carbon accumulation after mangrove rehabilitation, rather than soil-stock comparison approaches (or control-impact) that rely on small spatial-scale variability to reflect true carbon accumulation rates (Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018;Marb\u00e0 et al., 2015). Our study also provides evidence that CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes change with the age of a mangrove forest. This is a key finding given that recent studies highlight the importance of quantifying carbon emissions (i.e., CO 2 and CH 4 ) when calculating the net carbon balance in mangrove forests (Cameron et al., 2019a;Rosentreter et al., 2018b;Sidik et al., 2019). On average, CH 4 emissions offset 20% of soil carbon sequestration in established mangrove forests, but this varies between almost negligible emissions and 65.8% depending on latitude (Rosentreter et al., 2018b). While the data presented here is novel in terms of assessing greenhouse gas flux over different mangrove forest ages, we did not calculate the net carbon balance for these mangrove stands, as seasonal and diurnal measurements would be required to calculate this over the course of a year. Additionally, we have not accounted for other emissions such as N 2 O, or other carbon sinks, such as dissolved inorganic carbon or alkalinity (Maher et al., 2018).",
        "fc25d20b-2084-4efa-b40b-03c1e36e8f83": "Despite these limitations, the data here suggest that greenhouse gas emissions may be influenced by restoration-related mangrove development over time, and thus needs to be accounted for in estimates of net carbon drawdown from mangrove restoration (Cameron et al., 2019a). Mangrove forest age is known to influence aboveground and belowground biomass carbon stocks (Adame et al., 2018;Azman et al., 2021;Sasmito et al., 2019aSasmito et al., , 2020)). Here, we found an increase in mangrove forest biomass up to 17 years, and that the biomass of the 17and 35-year-old stands is equivalent to that of natural mangrove forests nearby (Navarro et al., 2020). Reaching equivalence to natural mangrove forest biomass in just 17 years is much faster than what most studies report, where rehabilitated mangroves tend to reach equivalence with natural mangrove forests after 40 years (Sasmito et al., 2019a). We hypothesise that this difference between our study and others results from the fact that Avicennia marina from temperate regions only reach a quarter of the height of their sub-tropical counterparts (Navarro et al., 2020;Saintilan, 1997Saintilan, , 1998)). Thus, these data suggest that the smaller temperate mangroves reach biomass equivalence in half the time. While we found the 17-year-old mangroves have higher biomass than 13-year-old forests, we also found that the 17-year-old forest had higher biomass than the 35-year-old stand. As average mangrove tree height was similar between the two stands, this was due to the fact that the 17-year-old forest had much higher density (3.5 trees m 2 ) than the 35-year-old forest (2.0 trees m 2 ). While mangrove forests generally decline in density with age, continued increases in height and trunk diameter mean they generally still increase in biomass with age (Salmo et al., 2013).",

Though many studies have examined the factors associated with long-term restoration success, few have examined which factors impact the establishment of restoration plantings.2. In Australia's Wet Tropics, we used a large replicated restoration experiment to assess seedling survival for 24 native rainforest species commonly used in local restoration efforts. The experiment allowed for a rigorous assessment of the effects of species functional traits, planting conditions, and landscape-and local-scale biotic and abiotic factors on seedling survival. This study reports on seedling survival between three different time periods of 0-4, 4-9 and 9-31 months post planting.3. The probability of seedling survival was influenced by multiple factors, varying in importance over time. Across the whole study period, seedlings with high wood density and which were planted closer to intact forest consistently displayed the highest probabilities of survival. Transient factors affecting seedling survival across the three time periods included plot aspect (0-4 months only), the identity of the planter and slope (4-9 and 9-31 months). Overall, species survival did not differ between the low (6 species) and high (24 species) diversity treatments, but was significantly lower in monocultures of Flindersia brayleyana by the end of the study.4. We demonstrate that early-stage seedling survival depends on species wood density and planting location. Our results support the use of species with more conservative growth strategies when limited funds are available for follow-up plantings. High wood density species had significantly higher survival than lower wood density, early successional species typically used in rainforest restoration plantings.\nSynthesis and applications.Our study highlights the importance of wood density and landscape structure to the initial survival of rainforest plantings. Factors influencing seedling survival shifted over time but, most importantly, our results highlight that, when planting into abandoned pastures, it may be preferable to select species with higher wood densities to maximize survival during the crucial early stages of establishment and growth.",

The response of species to environmental constraints in a mixture of a large number of species having different functional traits and resource use strategies, might be different in comparison to its response in a pure stand (Kelty, 2006;Ishii and Asano, 2010;Richards et al., 2010;Lebourgeois et al., 2013). It has been emphasized that the facilitative processes and niche complementarity in mixed species stands often lead to greater biomass production, and higher tree growth and carbon sequestration rates compared to pure stands (del Rio and Sterba, 2009;Cavard et al., 2011;Vallet and P\u00e9rot, 2011). Changes in species composition could sharply alter the potential for terrestrial carbon sequestration (Bunker et al., 2005). Particularly, in the regions experiencing similar climatic conditions, composition of the tree species becomes important for the carbon storage (Chen et al., 2011;He et al., 2013). In tropical dry forests, small-scale variations in soil and vegetation characteristics determine the distribution of woody species leading to high variation in species composition (Chaturvedi et al., 2011a;Chaturvedi and Raghubanshi, 2014). Due to the patchy distribution of tree assemblages, tropical dry forests generally show uneven distribution of aboveground tree biomass (AGB), carbon density (CD) and carbon accumulation (CA) (Chaturvedi et al., 2011b(Chaturvedi et al., ,c, 2012a)).

Species average WSG, in our study is almost same at all the stands, except the mono-specific (Teak), suggesting that stand-wise variations in SMC 1 and soil physico-chemical properties are not significantly affecting WSG of the tree species. Growth rates of tree species might be affected by variation in the WSG.",
        "90138047-4549-4f55-9269-a54ef951fa75": "Growth rates of tree species might be affected by variation in the WSG. In tropical forests, a number of studies have observed negative correlations between mean growth rate and WSG (Enquist et al., 1999;Burslem and Whitmore, 2003;Muller-Landau, 2004). In our study, the species exhibiting greatest WSG (Hardwickia binata) had lowest DBH increment (0.25 cm yr \u00c01 ) compared to the species with lowest WSG (Boswellia serrata), which exhibited highest DBH increment (0.80 cm yr \u00c01 ). Large number of tree species in at multi-specific stands exhibited <0.70 g cm \u00c03 WSG, compared to mono-specific stands. This shows that the faster growing species were more at multi-specific stands, compared to the mono-specific stands. Presence of faster growing species in a population could increase the overall growth of the population. In our study, multi-specific stands exhibited higher growth rates compared to the mono-specific stands due to presence of greater number of faster growing species at multi-specific stands. There are also some examples (Kelty, 1992;Cannell et al., 1992) where monocultures of faster growing species exhibited more growth than mixed species forests. For biomass estimation, trees greater than 10 cm DBH are frequently measured. Chaturvedi et al. (2011c) reported that majority of carbon in the forests of Vindhyan region is stored in stems P12.7 cm DBH. Therefore, in the present study, we selected individuals P9.6 cm DBH for AGB estimation. In the forest stands, saplings (P3.2 to <9.6 cm DBH) accounted for 58.3% (mono-specific, Sal) to 65.1% (multi-specific, Teak + Sal) of the total population of stems P3.2 cm DBH. On the other hand, in terms of AGB (dry wt.), the saplings accounted for 1.2% (9.8 t dry wt.",

Chaturvedi, unpublished). Thus, underestimation in carbon density due to non-sampling of thin stems would be between 1.2% and 2.1%. Teak and Sal are the locally dominant tree species in the monoand multi-specific stands at our study region. Due to presence of maximum BA at the respective stands, CD of Teak and Sal were greatest at those stands. Step-wise multiple regression has also indicated that among various vegetation characteristics, CD is highly influenced by BA. Although, Teak and Sal exhibited greatest CA a across species in the stands, their CA b were lower compared to the species which were comparatively rare (very low number of individuals) in occurrence. In our previous study (Chaturvedi et al., 2011c), we suggested that the contribution of rare species can be more than their fair share to the total carbon accumulation at the forest stands in terms of their contribution to BA. The efficiency for CA b of Teak and Sal were maximum at the multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. This might be due to greater intra-specific competition for the two species at the mono-specific stands and better facilitation by the associated species at the multi-specific stands. Lower CA b of Teak and Sal at the multi-specific (Teak + Sal), compared to their CA b at other multi-specific stands (Teak at multi-specific, Teak, and Sal at multispecific, Sal), might be due to higher inter-specific competition between the two species and differences in their resource requirements. It has been observed that the concentrations of exchangeable Ca, Mg and K are higher under naturally growing Teak forests (Yadav and Sharma, 1968), compared to that under Sal forests (Singh et al., 1990).",

Such differences in soil pH might be another reason for rare association of the two species in the forest. Observations for the diversity-productivity relationships in forests have produced conflicting results. Positive relationships between tree diversity and productivity have been observed by Caspersen and Pacala (2001), Paquette and Messier (2011) and Cardinale et al. (2011), and no relationship has been reported by Enquist and Niklas (2001). Frivold and Frank (2002), on the other hand, found that the positive or negative relationship between diversity and productivity depends on the identity of the dominant species at the mixed species stands. According to Assmann (1970), Smith (1986), Vandermeer (1989) and Smith et al. (1997), the higher productivity in an even aged mixed-species stand compared to single-species stands could be due to differences in the use of resources among the species in the mixture. Although, the productivity in the mixture may also become equal or lower if total resources are divided among all species (Smith, 1986;Kelty, 1992;Smith et al., 1997). Several plantation studies (e.g., Erskine et al., 2006;Forrester et al., 2004;DeBell et al., 1997;Piotto, 2008) have also reported more biomass production per unit area in mixtures compared to monoculture. Across the mono-and multi-specific stands, we also observed greater CA a at multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. The dominant species in the stands were either Teak or Sal, and these species exhibited lower capacity for carbon accumulation (CA b ) at their mono-specific stands compared to the multi-specific stands. At multi-specific stands, CA b of Teak and Sal was 2-3 times higher compared to mono-specific stands.",

Our findings could also be explained by the 'niche-complentarity hypothesis', according to which the system containing more species (i.e., more resource uptake strategies) utilizes resources more fully and becomes more productive.",

Results indicated that the carbon storage and allocation pattern varied greatly among forest types and was highly dependent on specific traits of trees and understory vegetation. The fast-growing species, such as Eucalyptus urophylla, accumulated more carbon in plant biomass. The biomass carbon was about 1.9-and 2.2-times greater than the 10-species mixed plantation and Castanopsis hystrix plantations, respectively. Meanwhile, the plantations sequestered 1.5-to 3-times more carbon in biomass than naturally recovered shrubland. The carbon allocation pattern between above-and below-ground compartments also varied with plantation type and stand age. The ratio of tree root carbon to tree aboveground carbon decreased with stand age for Eucalyptus urophylla and the 10-species mixed plantation. In contrast, the ratio increased for Acacia crassicarpa. Our data suggested that planting the fast-growing species in the degraded land of subtropical China was an effective choice in terms of carbon sequestration. The information about",

As a means of carbon sequestration, afforestation plays a vital role in alleviating the CO2 emission [2]. The carbon storage capacity of forest ecosystems has been the focus of significant research [3]. In the last two decades, the carbon sequestration function of forest systems has been significantly increased in China [4]. The plantation forests contributed about 80% of the total forest carbon sink increment of China [5]. The area of plantations in China was about 6.9 \u00d7 10 7 ha and accounted for about one third of the world's plantation area [6]. Most of these plantations are still immature [7] and show a substantial potential for carbon sequestration [8]. Carbon sinks in southern China accounted for more than 65% of the national carbon sinks [9]. Carbon sequestration could be affected by plantation types and stand ages [10]. It is urgent to assess the effects of forest types on carbon sequestration and carbon allocation in the subtropical region. Traditionally, \"space-for-time substitution\" and model simulation were the most frequently used approaches in previous studies that focused on carbon storage in different forest chronosequences [11]. However, the inaccuracy of the model and spatial heterogeneity greatly increased the uncertainty of results based on such methods [12]. Therefore, monitoring the forest dynamics of carbon sequestration for a longer term is an alternative approach and is necessary. Carbon allocation in above-and below-ground components of plants is one of the key processes of carbon cycling. The rate of carbon sequestration in above-and below-ground compartments is not coupled [13]. For example, total belowground carbon allocation of a Eucalyptus saligna plantation was observed to decline with stand age [14], but the underlying mechanism of carbon allocation was still poorly understood. Van der Werf and Nagel [15] suggested that carbon allocation to shoots and roots was mediated by nitrogen supply via regulating cytokinins and sucrose production.",

However, the studies regarding the carbon storage and allocation pattern among different plantation types are still scarce. Such information is vital to improve the estimation of the forest carbon budget and to provide the basis for forest management at a regional scale. Currently, the most common tree species used for plantations in southern China are Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia spp. [17]. They are generally cultivated in monocultures. The increased demand for high-quality timber and ecological services has resulted in the cultivation of valuable mixed plantations with native broad-leaved plant species [18,19]. In the current study, the plantations include: Eucalyptus urophylla monoculture (EU), Acacia crassicarpa monoculture (AC), Castanopsis hystrix monoculture (native species, CH), the mixed plantation of 10 native species (MX) and a naturally recovered shrubland as the control (NS). This study aimed to assess how the carbon storage and allocation varied with the five vegetation types (EU, AC, CH, MX and NS) in southern China. We used inventory data to estimate carbon stocks in above-and below-ground compartments, including trees, shrubs, herbs, forest floors and roots. We attempted to test the following hypotheses: (1) plantations of fast-growing exotic species accumulate more carbon in the plant biomass than those of native species; (2) plantations sequester more carbon in the plant biomass than the naturally recovered shrubland; and (3) carbon allocation patterns change with tree species and stand age.",

However, reforestation's effect on soil carbon accumulation remains unclear, which hampers our understanding of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. The change patterns of soil carbon storage in four young plantations, Eucalyptus urophylla monoculture (EU), Acacia crassicarpa monoculture (AC), Castanopsis hystrix monoculture (CH), a mixed plantation of 10 native tree species (MX), and a naturally recovered shrubland (NS), were compared at five stand ages during development in subtropical China. We observed that plant biomass was higher in plantations with fast-growing species (i.e. EU and AC) than with slow-growing species (i.e. CH and MX). However, no significant differences in soil carbon storage were observed among the four plantations with the same stand ages. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in soil carbon storage among the four plantations and NS. Furthermore, soil carbon storage exhibited a similar change pattern for the four plantations and naturally recovered shrubland during the 10-year period of early vegetation development. Specifically, soil carbon storage decreased slightly and non-significantly during the first 4 years (from 23.84 Mg ha \u00c01 to 20.79 Mg ha \u00c01 ) and increased thereafter (35.85 Mg ha \u00c01 in 10-year-old plantations). These results suggest that plant biomass increment and soil carbon accumulation were unsynchronized, and early reforestation had no significant effect on soil carbon accumulation. We conclude that plantations did not accelerate carbon sequestration in soils at early developmental stages compared with natural recovery and plant biomass may not be an appropriate index for evaluating soil carbon sequestration in young plantation.",

The rise of CO 2 -concentration has caused serious ecological consequences of changes in ecosystem structures and functions (Curtis et al., 1995;Norby and Luo, 2004). Reforestation as a means of carbon sequestration plays a crucial role in alleviating CO 2 -concentration increase (Hunter, 2001). The average annual increment of the world plantation area was approximately 3.60 \u00c2 10 6 ha from 1990 to 2010. The increase in plantation area in China is most remarkable in the world (FAO, 2010). China has a total plantation of approximately 6.9 \u00c2 10 7 ha, which is about one third of the world's total plantation area (State Forestry Administration, 2014). Plantations are responsible for approximately 80% of the carbon sink increment in China (Fang et al., 2007) of which plantations in southern China have contributed to more than 65% of the national carbon sinks (Piao et al., 2009). However, there is little information on the contribution of reforestation to carbon sequestration in soils. Soil carbon is primarily derived from plants (Kuzyakov and Domanski, 2000). Greater plant biomass could facilitate the inputs of plant-derived C (Bekku et al., 1997;De Deyn et al., 2008). Therefore, plant growth may promote carbon sequestration in soils. The variation of soil carbon can be partially explained by plant biomass indices such as DBH and H (Ren et al., 2013). However, it is still unclear how the soil carbon pool changes with plant growth in young plantations. Numerous studies have reported that soil carbon storage is related to forest age, root turnover, litter quality and soil chemical properties (Bashkin and Binkley, 1998;He et al., 2013).",

The effect of plantation types on soil carbon accumulation could primarily depend on litterfall quality and soil nutrient status (Binkley and Binkley, 1998;Wang et al., 2013). Litterfall quality is controlled by tree species of reforestation (Polyakova and Billor, 2007). Soil nutrient availability influences soil carbon dynamics through plant-soil-microbial interactions (Bohlen et al., 2001;Moore et al., 2015). High soil N availability stimulates tree growth, which potentially increases carbon inputs into soils through litterfall and rhizodeposition, and promotes carbon sequestration in soils by decreasing decomposition rates of old litter and recalcitrant soil organic matter by suppression of soil microbes and chemical stabilization (Liljeroth et al., 1994;Jandl et al., 2007). Moreover, previous studies suggest that low soil fertility limits soil carbon sequestration (van Groenigen et al., 2006;Hoogmoed et al., 2014). However, these results were obtained through comparisons of paired sites performed only one time or through chronosequence study of only one plantation type; such a small sample is insufficient for supporting these researchers' conclusions. Meanwhile, Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma (2013) synthesized 81 studies in tropical locations. They found that soil carbon in tropical successional plantation forests was not significantly affected by vegetation type and that climate factors drove greater variability in soil carbon levels than forest age. The impact of reforestation on soil carbon, which is important for understanding carbon cycling in forest ecosystems (Huntington, 1995;van Straaten et al., 2015), is still debatable.

Natural regeneration is often successful at reestablishing a forest in ecosystems adapted to fire, but there is increasing concern that the changing size, frequency and severity of wildfire is causing regeneration failures or inadequate densities of trees that sequester and store carbon following these disturbances. It remains unclear whether the action of planting trees accelerates carbon storage following fire compared to forests established through natural regeneration. The central interior of British Columbia recently experienced multiple years of record-breaking fire activity. Rehabilitation planting focused on reestablishing trees in the managed forest but was also prescribed in previously unmanaged forests to initiate carbon sequestration. Planting is often accompanied by other stand treatments such as salvage harvesting or snag removal and debris clearing to ensure planter safety. Here, we determine carbon recovery and stores in 21 wildfires across a chronosequence from the early 1960s to 2015. We measured above and belowground carbon pools to determine the effect of time since fire and planting treatments on carbon. Tree planting did not increase total ecosystem carbon over time, but rather decreased carbon through the loss of dead wood from site preparation. All carbon pools were affected by time since fire except the mineral soil pool, which was best predicted by soil clay content and coarse fragments positive effects. Live tree carbon increased over time, with more stored in planted stands over 60 years compared to stands that were not planted. Projecting growth to 100 years since fire suggests we may see increasing divergence in carbon stores in planted stands over a full fire-return interval, but these differences remain relatively small [mean (sd): 140.8 (19.6) Mg\u2022ha -1 in planted compared to 136.9 (27.5) Mg\u2022ha -1 in not-planted stands], with 1.4 Mg\u2022ha -1 year -1 sequestered in not-planted compared to 1.5 Mg\u2022ha -1 year -1 in planted stands.",

This terrestrial forest carbon is stored in aboveground wood and vegetation, belowground in the roots of living and dead trees, and belowground in vegetative litter, soil organic layers, and mineral soil horizons. The amount of carbon stored in forests changes over time, as living vegetation establishes, grows, dies, and decays. Large-scale disturbance events, such as insect outbreaks and wildfire result in larger forest carbon emissions. Climate change may increase forest carbon emissions through increased size, severity or frequency of wildfires (Wang et al., 2015;Coogan et al., 2019), with an estimated 2.2 Pg\u2022C\u2022year -1 of carbon emitted from fire globally (1979-2016;Van Der Werf et al., 2017). Capturing the impacts of fire on carbon dynamics requires quantifying pyrogenic carbon emissions (Campbell et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2018;Bowman et al., 2020), the carbon legacies from fire (Gough et al., 2007;Sant\u00edn et al., 2015;Ferster et al., 2016;Furniss et al., 2019;Stenzel et al., 2019) as well as rates of carbon recovery following fire (Seedre et al., 2014;Eskelson et al., 2016;Stevens-Rumann and Morgan, 2019;Kelly et al., 2021). Fire legacies include varying amounts of live, dead, scorched or charred trees, consumed organic soils and exposed mineral soil (Walker et al., 2018).

Although many forests are adapted to wildfire (Burton et al., 2008;Day et al., 2020), some forested regions are experiencing a decline in forest recovery after fire, either from a lack of trees establishing (Harvey et al., 2014;Stevens-Rumann and Morgan, 2019;Turner et al., 2019), or shifts in forest community composition (Baltzer et al., 2021;Mack et al., 2021). As a result, there is growing concern about the potential for biome shifts, where previously forested land becomes deforested, or slow rates of tree establishment following fire, impacting carbon sequestration potential. Regenerating trees are especially vulnerable to growing season drought (Harvey et al., 2016) and minimum temperatures (Guz et al., 2021). To mitigate this risk of slow or absent tree regeneration and kickstart carbon sequestration after fire, actions such as planting trees are increasingly used to mitigate the carbon lost to fire (Povak et al., 2020). These nature-based solutions to climate change are immediate actions to prevent worst case climate forecasts (Fargione et al., 2018;Drever et al., 2021), but also require ongoing estimation of the carbon consequences of these actions (i.e., Graves et al., 2020).

Carbon stored in the forest floor, or belowground in roots and in the mineral soil can also be affected by post-fire site preparations if these include soil disturbance, such as mounding or trenching to increase planting microsite availability. Before the uncertain impact of climate change, BC's subboreal forests would have been expected to naturally regenerate after fire. A stand-replacing fire regime dominates the region, with fire return intervals of 100 years at lower elevations, and 150 years at higher elevations (DeLong, 1998). While a standreplacing regime suggests complete canopy mortality, partial canopy mortality and unburned patches within fire perimeters are common (DeLong and Kessler, 2000;Meyn and Feller, 2006) with a matrix of varying fire severities (Guindon et al., 2020). Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Dougl. Ex Loud.), interior spruce [Picea glauca x engelmannii (Moench) Voss)], subalpine fir [Abies lasiocarpa (Hook) Nutt.] and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) dominate these forests and generally regenerate well after fire, particularly the serotinous pine and suckering aspen.

Logged stands in sub-boreal systems can transition from carbon sources to sinks between 8 and 10 years after harvest (Fredeen et al., 2007), or after 5 years in European hemiboreal (Rebane et al., 2020), whereas burned stands can be more variable in the time required to return to a carbon sink (Amiro et al., 2010).

Our study area is at the southern edge of the boreal biome of British Columbia, Canada, where tree planting after fire has emerged as a common action to mitigate the risk of regeneration failure and post-wildfire erosion. Record-breaking wildfires in 2017 and 2018 followed by another significant year in 2021 (BC Wildfire Service, 2021) reinforce the need to quantify the impact of rehabilitation planting on carbon and other aspects of forest recovery.

To quantify carbon recovery, we sampled the major carbon pools across a 60-year chronosequence of forests recovering after wildfire of differing severities and project carbon in these stands forward to 100 years post-fire.

Site preparation activities associated with planting removed dead wood and there were insufficient gains in the rate of live tree carbon sequestration from planted trees to overcome the loss of the dead wood carbon. While globally only 8% of carbon is found in dead wood (Pan et al., 2011), the majority of biomass remaining after fire is contained in this carbon pool (Gough et al., 2007;Donato et al., 2013;Stenzel et al., 2019;Lutz et al., 2020). We found the largest difference in carbon pools between planted and not-planted stands was the higher dead wood carbon, with significantly higher carbon in dead standing snags and downed wood stored in stands that were not planted. To reduce slash and eliminate overhead hazards for tree planters, post-fire management practices in BC have included site preparations such as knocking trees down, pile and burning dead wood, or salvage harvesting. Soil disturbances such as mounding, or trenching can also be used to prepare the site for planting. Whereas underplanting the standing snags would maintain the important dead carbon pool in planted stands, we did not find these practices common in our study area (only four stands were underplanted).",
        "e7e1156b-07d7-4804-91b9-1db40e1344d0": "Continued use of knockdown, pile and burning and soil preparation treatments in the central interior following more recent fires in 2018, suggests an ongoing need to explore options that leave dead wood on site as legacy carbon storage and provide safe working conditions for tree planting (i.e., North et al., 2019). Maintaining the dead wood carbon pool may conflict with other forest objectives, such as managing fuels for future wildfire risk (Donato et al., 2016;Lutz et al., 2020). Understanding the tradeoff between carbon and fuels will be important in determining the desired postfire management practices across different portions of managed forest landscapes. Snags constitute a large proportion of the dead biomass following fire (Campbell et al., 2007;Donato et al., 2016;Stenzel et al., 2019). Dead standing trees store carbon after fire (Stenzel et al., 2019), often decaying at a slower rate than downed wood due to lower moisture and decreased soil-borne decomposer activity (Angers et al., 2011;Kaytor, 2016). Planted stands had fewer snags, which is not surprising because site treatments or salvage harvesting would have removed or knocked down standing trees. We found that CWD contributed more carbon than snags to the dead carbon pool both in planted and not-planted stands over time which may be the result of prefire tree mortality. Our study occurs across a landscape heavily affected by a mountain pine beetle outbreak starting in the mid-1990s (Aukema et al., 2006). Fires that burned after the outbreak would have encountered a higher abundance of standing dead trees (Lewis and Thompson, 2011;Rhoades et al., 2020) and a higher abundance of CWD post epidemic (50-90% of MPB killed trees fall 12-16 years after death; Harvey, 1986;Mitchell and Preisler, 1998;Audley et al., 2021).",
        "f107a108-7741-4026-9b20-f93297a6bee8": "We found higher carbon stored in snags versus downed wood only in not-planted stands that burned at high severity, which supports the finding that increased burn severity can decrease snag fall rates after fire (Angers et al., 2011). As we observed changes over time using a chronosequence and did not monitor stands over time, it is not possible to determine trends in snag fall, CWD recruitment, or CWD decay rates. Combustion of the woody boles of large trees is low during fire, with more complete combustion of the forest floor across fire severity (Campbell et al., 2007). Consequently, the gradual development of the forest floor is a key process for post-fire carbon recovery. We found that the forest floor carbon pool was lowest shortly after fire, and increased over time, with slightly more carbon in not-planted stands compared to planted. Using our linear model from not-planted stands to predict forest floor carbon content at 190 years would yield 41-44 Mg\u2022ha -1 , which is a reasonable estimate compared to longer-term studies [32-47 Mg\u2022ha -1 at 190 years in Kranabetter (2009) and 35-78 Mg\u2022ha -1 for >140 years in Fredeen et al. (2005) and Kranabetter and Macadam (2007)]. Although a linear response simplifies the recovery process, which is tied to changes in inputs from herbaceous cover to moss cover to tree cover during succession (Deluca and Boisvenue, 2012;Andrieux et al., 2018), others have also successfully fit linear relationships to forest floor carbon increases after fire (Nalder and Wein, 1999 for aspen stands; Andrieux et al., 2018 for black spruce stands).",
        "bb70356e-03c8-4e4d-903f-2437776fe05b": "Conceptual models suggest that this carbon accumulation likely reaches an equilibrium and asymptotes with time (Seedre et al., 2011), although an impressive 5,000+ year chronosequence in the Swedish boreal forest suggests that in the absence of disturbance, belowground carbon can continue to accumulate (Wardle et al., 2012). In the model with fire severity as a covariate, in stands 5-35 since fire, the random effect of fire identity explained more variation than any fixed effect, which supports existing models that use the characteristics of individual fires and fire weather indicators such as soil moisture and drought indices to predict forest floor consumption (De Groot et al., 2009). Fire season and intensity, particularly the patterns of surface and crown fire, are also potential drivers of forest floor consumption that we were not able to include in our models. The satellite-derived fire severity index dNBR did not explain forest floor carbon, perhaps because fire effects on tree crowns (which can be remotely sensed by satellite imagery), are not highly correlated with consumption of the forest floor in all stand types (Alonzo et al., 2017). Post-fire recovery of mineral soil carbon in boreal forests is depicted as a small gradual increase (Seedre et al., 2011), or unchanging (Deluca and Boisvenue, 2012). When soil carbon remains constant, as we observed, regenerating stands create carbon inputs through litter and fine root exudates and turnover as they grow, but these inputs are balanced by losses through decomposition. Small changes in mineral soil carbon would have been difficult to detect across our study area without a greater sampling effort because of stand differences in clay content, coarse fragment content and the C:N ratio that had strong effects on soil carbon (despite our efforts to only sample within a narrow range of site productivity). Site variability in the boreal is a common issue, although carbon increases with time can still be observed (Pregitzer and Euskirchen, 2004), sometimes even in a relatively short period- Seedre et al.",
        "010f3f7b-eafe-4dde-af1e-39eedfb22ea9": "(2014) found an increase in mineral soil carbon within 27 years after fire in boreal mixedwoods. Over a 300-year chronosequence in black spruce stands, Andrieux et al. (2018) detected indirect effects of time on pH (which increased metal oxides thereby increasing mineral soil carbon), demonstrating the complexity of the processes connecting belowground carbon with aboveground disturbance. Below and aboveground interactions can also effect carbon sequestration via productivity, but we did not observe an effect of mineral soil properties on the live carbon pool (even though soil C:N ratio can be an important predictor of tree growth; Omari et al., 2021). Although the slightly higher biomass of the planted stands in this study would have produced greater amounts of belowground carbon from root litter and exudates, net primary productivity and soil organic matter accumulation do not have a simple linear relationship (Jackson et al., 2017). If live biomass was a strong driver of mineral soil carbon we would have also expected to see an increase in carbon over time since fire. Instead, the most parsimonious explanation for the higher mineral soil carbon and lower forest floor carbon in planted stands is that site preparation treatments incorporated the forest floor (and possibly other dead carbon) into the mineral soil. We found that live carbon was higher in planted stands compared to not-planted stands by 60 years since fire. This effect was small [decrease in AIC by 5 with the inclusion of planting treatment, and a difference in intercept (mean) of 7.9 Mg\u2022ha -1 ], but detectable. More consistent and earlier establishment of tree regeneration, coupled with site preparation, and the use of seedlings produced through tree improvement programs, may explain the higher carbon stored in live trees in planted stands. Live tree carbon can also be higher in plantations after harvesting compared to wildfire, not because of increased growth rates, but from more live trees retained during harvest for wildlife habitat, compared to wildfires with complete tree mortality (Seedre et al., 2014).",
        "e664333d-af2c-4f80-b26f-ca6653c2805e": "This was not the case in our study, where partial mortality from fire led to more live trees remaining in the not-planted stands. The planted stands had lower live carbon in larger diameter classes shortly after fire likely because of post-fire salvage and site preparation removing the live trees that survived wildfire. We estimate that a linear projection of growth and carbon accumulation in live stems to 100 years since fire is 0.1 Mg\u2022ha -1 year -1 faster in planted stands (1.4 Mg\u2022ha -1 year -1 ) compared to naturally regenerating stands (1.3 Mg\u2022ha -1 year -1 ). The nonlinear model fit suggests an earlier peak in biomass accumulation in planted compared to not-planted stands. Similarly, in southern boreal ecosystems, biomass accumulation rate may peak later in Sub-boreal forests in BC are adapted to frequent stand replacing or mixed severity fire events (DeLong, 1998). These ecosystems support serotinous lodgepole pine that can retain aerial and soil seed banks even after widespread mountain pine beetle outbreaks (Teste et al., 2011) and regenerate successfully after fire even after the outbreak (Talucci et al., 2019). We also find support that these forests regenerate effectively after fire, even in the younger fires that would have occurred after a mountain pine beetle outbreak. We did not find evidence of natural regeneration failures following wildfire, with naturally regenerating stands containing similar densities of trees as planted stands. Recruitment of lodgepole pine can come as a rapid pulse (Charron and Greene, 2002) and/or as ongoing regeneration for upward of 10 years after fire (Stevens-Rumann et al., 2018). Regeneration densities over our 60-year chronosequence suggest that not-planted stands had a longer period of regeneration, but these stands all eventually became stocked. While we did not measure the spatial pattern of regeneration, the longer period of regeneration and lack of tree planting (even spacing) would likely result in different size and within stand spatial structure (Ziegler et al., 2017).",
        "68734d9d-a2cf-4844-b8c0-58ef675d1734": "This type of temporal and spatial variability in seedling establishment following insect outbreaks and fire, creates landscape-scale heterogeneity that can decrease the future risk of large-scale outbreaks (Seidl et al., 2016). A common concern of planting trees compared to allowing natural regeneration to establish a forest, is lower tree species diversity in planted stands (Dampier et al., 2007). We found similar tree and seedling species composition in both planted and not-planted stands. In both cases, lodgepole pine dominated the regeneration layer shortly after fire, and a mix of trembling aspen, interior spruce and subalpine fir occurred at lower densities in both treatments. Interior spruce and subalpine fir are more dependent on the fire coinciding with a mast year (Pounden et al., 2014) and distance to seed source than pine, due to the lack of a seed bank (Greene and Johnson, 2000), but still established well after fire in our stands, and continued to establish in the understory of older planted and not-planted stands. While generally composition was similar, planted stands included Douglas-fir and western larch seedlings, as a result of assisted migration. Species distribution models suggest these species will be well suited to future climates with the sub-boreal becoming more suitable for temperate species (MacKenzie and Mahony, 2021). Climate may change more rapidly than species are able to migrate to occupy new suitable climatic habitat (Aitken et al., 2008), so planting trees based on future suitability may assist in creating more resilient forests to climate change (MacKenzie and Mahony, 2021). Although our results suggest that risk of post-fire establishment failure was low for the past 60 years in central interior BC, risks could change in the future with climate change.",
        "d06a27bd-648d-4d82-ba24-d64bf9ee06df": "Growing season conditions, such as increased drought, as well as more frequent, short-interval, overlapping fire events, can affect tree establishment and forest recovery following fire (Mansuy et al., 2012;Harvey et al., 2016;Hansen et al., 2018;Stevens-Rumann and Morgan, 2019). Summer droughts will impact both natural and planted tree seedling survival (Ouzts et al., 2015), so a greater understanding of the ecological context for the risk of tree establishment failure following wildfire is important in deploying reforestation programs effectively (Stevens-Rumann et al., 2018). Previous forest cover is an important determinant of post-fire forest composition and carbon recovery in natural regenerating stands (Eskelson et al., 2016). We did not consider pre-fire tree composition in our analysis because of data limitations (variable availability and quality of forest inventory pre-fire) and because pre-fire composition will have less influence on post-fire recovery in stands that are planted. Our study was also challenged by the highly variable and potentially confounded effects of site preparation methods and time. Techniques used in the forest industry to prepare a site for planting have changed over time, with recently increased efforts in fire rehabilitation to leave dead wood on site. Anecdotally and with field observations, site preparations may have been more intense in older planted stands prior to planting compared to younger planted stands. We were not able to reconstruct silviculture histories for all stands from available records, and we also did not sample to capture the impacts of site preparation method. Changes in site preparation techniques may then result in different carbon recovery trajectories in planted stands in the future.",

The model was used to determine changes in forest structure over time and then applied to simulate changes in aboveground biomass and nitrogen storage since exclusion of the natural frequent fire regime in an unharvested Arizona forest. Dendroecological reconstruction of forest structure in 1876, prior to Euro-American settlement, was used to initialize the model; projections were validated with forest measurements in 1992. Biomass allocations shifted from herbaceous plants to trees, and nitrogen was increasingly retained in living and dead tree biomass over the 116-year period (1876-1992). Forest conditions in 1992 were substantially degraded compared to reference presettlement conditions: old-growth trees were dying at accelerated rates, herbaceous production was reduced nearly 90%, and the entire stand was highly susceptible to high-intensity wildfire. Following an experiment initiated in 1993 to test ecological restoration treatments, future changes were modeled for the next century. Future forest structure remained within the natural presettlement range of variability under the full restoration treatment, in which forest biomass structure was thinned to emulate presettlement conditions and repeated low-intensity fire was reintroduced. Simulation of the control treatment indicated continu-ation of exceptionally high tree density, probably culminating in stand-replacing ecosystem change through high-intensity wildfire or tree mortality from pathogens. Intermediate results were observed in the partial restoration treatment (tree thinning only); the open forest structure and high herbaceous productivity found immediately after treatment were gradually degraded as dense tree cover reestablished in the absence of fire. Modeling results support comprehensive restorative management as a long-term approach to conservation of key indigenous ecosystem characteristics.",

Across the western United States, ponderosa forests have become dense with small, young trees, herbaceous productivity has declined, and forest floor fuels have accumulated. Today forest landscapes support high-intensity wildfires and are increasingly susceptible to large-scale pathogen outbreaks (Covington & Moore 1994 a ). Restoration experiments have begun following several approaches based on thinning, burning, fuel treatments, seeding, and other treatments (Fiedler et al. 1988;Sackett et al. 1996;Covington et al. 1997;Scott 1998). Forecasting long-term effects of alternative treatments through ecological simulation modeling provides useful information to scientists, managers, and the public in making decisions about the nature and priorities of restoration efforts. Two distinct modeling methods are available: statistical models based on analysis of past system behavior, and process models, often with stochastic elements, which seek to emulate underlying biological or physical processes. Because the fitting of statistical models to readily measurable data can be done with great precision, such models tend to be highly accurate in the near term, as long as the original environmental conditions under which the model was developed are maintained. Several statistical growth and yield models are available for ponderosa pine (e.g., Wycoff et al. 1982;Edminster et al. 1991). However, because actual biological relationships are modeled, process models are more suitable for analysis of system behavior under changing environmental conditions, over long time periods (when mortality and regeneration processes are modeled), and under disturbance regimes, such as fire, which were not incorporated in the datasets used to develop statistical models. Short-term predictive accuracy may be reduced for process models as compared to statistical models, because data for model development may be more difficult to obtain and the variety of complex natural processes may be more difficult to model. Successional change in western forests under alternative fire regimes has been simulated with the ecological process models SILVA (Kercher & Axelrod 1984) in California and FIRESUM (Keane et al.",

The models simulate changes in forest species composition and fuel loading at the plot level under alternative fire regimes. They trace their development history to JABOWA (Botkin et al. 1972), a process-based, gap-replacement ecological model, which has been used to analyze ecosystem dynamics in northern hardwoods (e.g., Covington 1981). FIRESUM models overstory and understory ecological change under either userdetermined or stochastic fire regimes, incorporating Rothermel's (1972) surface fire behavior model to predict fire behavior. The program can simulate fire effects on mortality, regeneration, and tree density, changes in species composition, forest density, and fuels over several centuries, with implications for fire danger, wildlife habitat, old-growth conservation, and other management issues. Keane et al. (1989;1990) provide validation data and sensitivity testing for FIRESUM in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests. More recently, the gapreplacement and fire modeling components of FIRESUM have been integrated with the detailed mechanistic model FOREST-BGC (Running & Coughlan 1988;Running & Gower 1991) in a new model, FIRE-BGC, to permit successional modeling which incorporates biogeochemical process modeling at highly resolved time steps and large spatial scales (Keane et al. 1996). Because of its complexity and high input requirements, however, FIRE-BGC will require extensive testing and sampling before it can be extended to sites beyond the northern Rockies. Beginning in 1992, we initiated an ecological restoration experiment in a fire-excluded ponderosa pine forest at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (hereafter GPNA). Three treatments were tested: (1) control; (2) full restoration of ecosystem structure (thinning to restore density, age, size, and spatial distributions of trees) and fire disturbance process (removal of accumulated duff, reintroduction of fire in prescription at four-year intervals); and (3) partial restoration (thinning only, without fire).

Study plots were set up in 7, 11-22, and 26-year-old planted Rhizophora apiculata Blume plantations. There is a significant inverse correlation between DBH and tree density (R 2 \u00bc 0.73; p , 0.01). To derive an allometric relation to estimate aboveground biomass, 32 trees representing all ages were chosen randomly and harvested at ground level to examine allometric relations. We measured the fresh and dry weight of stems (W S ), branches (W B ), leaves (W L ), and aboveground stilt roots (W R ) in situ. Allometric relationships were satisfied best with DBH as an independent variable (R 2 \u00bc 0.72, 0.89, 0.87, 0.98, and 0.97 for leaves, branches, stilt roots, stem, and total aboveground biomass, respectively; p , 0.001). The total aboveground biomass was estimated in the plantations to vary between 76 and 320 tons/ha. Of this, more than 50% of total aboveground biomass was represented by stems.

They provide a variety of ecosystem services, such as sources of food (fish, shellfish, crabs, etc.) timber, fuel wood, and nursery grounds for many commercially important aquatic organisms. Mangroves stabilize coastlines and in many cases promote coastal accretion, providing a natural barrier against storms, cyclones, tidal bores, flooding, and other potentially damaging natural forces (Alongi, 2008(Alongi, , 2009;;Giesen et al., 2007;Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007;Peter, 1999;Tri, Adger, and Kelly, 1998). However, mangrove forests have declined significantly in SE Asia over the past four decades (1970s-2000s). The main reasons for mangrove loss and degradation have been population pressure resulting in wood extraction and conversion to other land uses such as shrimp ponds, agricultural fields, salt pans, settlements, ports, and industrial estates. The resulting environmental impacts have contributed to the decline and degradation of mangrove resources (Hong, 1991;Hong and San, 1993;Macintosh, Ashton, and Havanon, 2002;Ong, Gong, and Clough, 1995). Recently, people have begun to appreciate the true value of mangroves, and a growing awareness of the impacts of forest loss has led to renewed efforts to protect and restore mangroves. There are also increasing efforts by governments, nongovernmental organizations, and local communities around the world to conserve and rehabilitate mangroves and to manage them in a more sustainable way. In the context of climate change, mangroves are known to provide options for both adaptation and mitigation. According to Alongi (2008), mangroves function as coastal protection to chronic disturbance events (including climate change).

In order to maintain mangrove functions and services, both quantity and quality of mangrove forest should be preserved. Therefore, to support the effort to protect, conserve, and develop mangrove areas, quantitative studies on their functions and services are essential. Estimation of total biomass in woody ecosystems is important because of its relevance to nutrient turnover and the potential to store carbon. There are several studies on the biomass of mangroves worldwide. However, their values are very site specific. For example, in low latitudes, primary or mature mangrove forests generally have high aboveground biomass. On the other hand, the aboveground biomass is always low in temperate areas and may be related to different climatic conditions, such as temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, and frequency of storms (Komiyama, Ong, and Poungparn, 2008). This study focuses on a quantitative assessment of aboveground biomass and its partitioning over various tree components with the primary objectives of deriving allometric regression equations for total aboveground biomass and for leaf, branch, stem, and stilt root biomass of Rhizophora apiculata in plantations in Thanh Phu Nature Reserve, Mekong Delta, Vietnam.",

Results from previous research in the area show that density of planted mangroves was 8500-8800 trees/ha in 2-5-year-old plantations (Sub-FIPI II, 2003). Subsequently, density relies upon self-thinning and natural regeneration processes. Besides natural processes, the density of vegetation in the study area is affected by human activities. Mangrove species are long-lived perennials with long reproductive lives. According to Hutchings and Saenger (1987), flower primordials develop on plants when they are 3 to 4 years old. Kandelia candel in Longhai, Fujian, China, started flowering and producing propagules at about 8 years old, and the number and density of flowers varied among plants of different ages (Chen, 2000). In our study area, R. apiculata begins to flower and produce propagules after about 5 years (personal observation). Natural regeneration led to an increase of tree density with stand age and to increased variation between the smallest and the largest tree diameters, heights, and basal areas. This early start of flowering resulted in an increase of tree density in older plantations. As Clough and Scott (1989) have pointed out, in dense mangrove stands, height is not a parameter that can be estimated rapidly for each tree over relatively large mangrove areas, but since the simple form of the relationship (using only DBH) provides an accurate estimate, there is no need for additional input variables. The coefficient of determination of the relationships between DBH and weight of tree organs was the highest in stem weight, and coefficients exceeded 0.8 for all components except weight of leaves (R 2 \u00bc 0.72).",
        "2992c7f9-74de-434f-a6cc-5257b9c7631a": "These results agree well with those of Clough (1992) that allometric relationships between stem diameter and weight of leaves and propagules are generally less robust than those for stem weight or total weight, because leaves and propagules are more easily broken off the tree by strong winds and waves. Moreover, weights of leaves and propagules may have phenological variations even within trees of the same age. Selected allometric equations for various mangrove species for aboveground biomass in relation to DBH (in centimeters) are provided in Table 4. The allometric relations were stronger when only DBH was used as the independent variable. Several studies suggested that estimation of biomass on the basis of a combination of tree height and stem diameter is less robust than when either are measured alone (Clough, Dixon, and Dalhaus, 1997;Komiyama et al., 1988Komiyama et al., , 2000;;Tam et al., 1995). Moreover, the height of individual trees is difficult to measure accurately in an extensive closed canopy. These factors make diameter easier to obtain in the field than height, and thus DBH is a useful variable for estimating mangrove biomass, in addition to the accuracy of the allometric relation. Diameter at 1.3 m height was also used to estimate biomass components of mangroves in Biscayne National Park, Florida (Michael et al., 2001); in Satun Province, southern Thailand (Komiyama et al., 2000); and in the north of Vietnam (Cuc and Ninomiya, 2007). Several studies that have used regressions to investigate biomass adopt the DBH or the perimeter at breast height as the independent variable (Soares, 1997).

However, some studies used equations based on height and DBH for the estimation of aboveground biomass of mangrove species (Cintron and Schaeffer-Novelli, 1984;Imbert and Rollet, 1989;Lee, 1990;Suzuki and Tagawa, 1983). Mackey (1993) calculated the biomass of individuals using predictive regression of biomass on height or girth. In the same way, Sherman, Fahey, and Martinez (2003) found high significant allometric relationships between tree parabolic  volume (which is based on height and DBH) and aboveground biomass components (total, leaf, trunk, branch, and prop roots). Ross et al. (2001) studying Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle mangroves in America used both simple and multiple regression models for the estimation of aboveground biomass. They developed models for stem, branch, leaf, stilt root, and total biomass estimation, based on diameter at 30 cm above ground, height, and crown volume. Fromard et al.

(2002) explain that the allometric relationship for stem weight is usually expressed as a function of stem diameter and height, such as DBH 2 H, which differs between tree species, forcing the determination of a series of allometric equations for all tree species. The species-specific allometric relationships were analyzed based on the specific gravity of stems, with the aim of establishing a common equation for predicting the stem weight of mangroves. The total aboveground biomass of the mangrove stands ranged from 76 to 320 tons dry weight (DW)/ha (Table 3). The differences in biomass were due mainly to the differences in stand age. The ratio of partitioning biomass to total aboveground biomass ranged from 10% to 55% for leaves, branches, stilt roots, and stems. The proportion of stem biomass is highest. This result is normal for woody plants that add secondary growth. A similar trend of high biomass accumulation in nonphotosynthetic organs in mature forest was reported by Komiyama et al. (1988). The biomasses in this study are comparable with those of some other primary forests, such as those in Halmahera, Indonesia, and Andaman Island, India (Komiyama et al., 1988); 15-year-old R. apiculata in Phuket, Thailand (Christensen, 1978); and 28-year-old forest in Matang, Malaysia (Ong, Gong, and Wong, 1982) of 357, 159, and 212 tons/ha, respectively, but smaller than those estimated in some natural mangroves or very mature forests (Komiyama et al., 1988;Putz and Chan, 1986) of 270 and 299 tons/ha, respectively.",

Apart from the geographical location and forest structural attributes, the net primary productivity depends on abiotic factors such as hypoxic conditions, tidal height, frequency of tidal inundation, availability of nutrients, salinity, and climatic factors (Aksornkoae, 1993;Hutchings and Saenger, 1987). More and more mangroves around the world are affected by human activities, and all may be influenced by global changes in climate or sea level.

We hypothesized that mixed plantations with a high number of tree species could provide a higher level of ecosystem services than monocultures. To test this hypothesis, we selected the experimental forest of the Huitong National Research Station of Forest Ecosystem as our study area and applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Model (InVEST) and the Integrated Water Storage Capacity Model to evaluate five types of ecosystem services (timber production, water provision, carbon storage, soil conservation, and water retention) provided by plantations and natural forests. None of the plantations or natural forests were found to have a constantly high level of multiple ecosystem services. The results showed that the overall benefits of the ecosystem services were highest in mixed plantations, followed by coniferous plantations and broadleaf plantations. Natural forests in our study had relatively high values of regulating services. These findings suggest that plantation management should increase the number of mixed plantations rather than monocultures. In addition, the future protection of natural forests requires urgent consideration.",

Compared to natural forests, plantations mainly comprise a few genera of fast-growing trees (Brockerhoff et al., 2008). The area and timber production of plantations constitute approximately 6.9% and 60% of global forests, respectively (Carle and Holmgren, 2008;Payn et al., 2015;Jacobs et al., 2016). However, the expansion of some plantations comes at the expense of natural and semi-natural vegetation (FAO, 2010). Consequently, plantations need to provide important ecosystem services just as natural forests do in addition to timber products (Ferraz et al., 2013;Baral et al., 2016). This has led scientists to inquire into the magnitude and stability of ecosystem services that plantations can provide. A large body of evidence has established that mixed species stands have a higher level of production than monocultures (Pretzsch and Schutze, 2009;Cardinale et al., 2011;Carnol et al., 2014). For example, Pretzsch and Schutze (2009) found that mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech produced up to 59% more above-ground biomass than pure stands. Morin et al. (2011) showed a positive correlation between the richness of tree species and timber production. In addition, several studies have found that mixed species stands store more carbon than monocultures (He et al., 2013;Gamfeldt et al., 2013;Brandt et al., 2014). However, relatively few studies have focused on the comparison of multiple ecosystem services between monocultures and mixed species stands (Gamfeldt et al., 2013;Brandt et al., 2014).",

Consequently, there is an urgent need for the integrated analysis of multiple ecosystem services between monocultures and mixed plantations. In this study, we applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST model) and the Integrated Water Storage Capacity Model to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by plantations and natural forests. We compared ecosystem services that are provided by monocultures and mixed plantations including timber production, water provision, carbon storage, water retention, and soil conservation, and we tested the hypothesis that mixed plantations have a higher level of ecosystem services than monocultures. By integrating these results, we attempted to discuss whether plantations can replace natural forests in their ability to provide ecosystem services to human society as well as the type of plantation that can provide the highest level of ecosystem services in the hilly red-soil region of southern China.",

Our study showed that mixed plantations have the highest overall benefits, and they have advantages not only in timber production but also in carbon storage and water provision when compared to monocultures. Moreover, all five ecosystem services were higher in mixed forests than in coniferous plantations. The overall benefits in the mixed C. lanceolata and M. macclurei forest and the mixed P. massoniana and S. superba forest were 0.77 and 0.60, respectively, which were higher than in the other forest types, but the mixed C. lanceolata and C. camphora forest had a relatively low overall benefit (0.35). These broadleaf species mixed with coniferous plantations were all affirmed as having a positive effect on tree growth and productivity (Fang et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2009;Xue et al., 2012). The differences were partly explained by the proportion of tree species composition. The proportion of C. lanceolata in mixed C. lanceolata and C. camphora forest was 20%, and the proportion of the other two broadleaf species was 40% each. Consequently, 20% was too low of a proportion to improve the other ecosystem services, except for timber production. It confirmed our hypothesis and indicated that tree species composition is important for ecosystem services in the same geographical regions. Our results also showed that water retention and soil conservation in broadleaf plantations were higher than in mixed plantations and coniferous plantations, and water provision in coniferous plantations was the highest with little advantage. Previous research has shown that soil properties and forest type affect all three hydrological services, and other factors including precipitation, evapotranspiration, slope, and human activity all have an effect on water provision and soil conservation (Klein et al., 2013;Wang and Fu, 2013;Li et al., 2015). Under the same environmental conditions in our study area, soil properties and forest types were the most important factors.",

A higher capacity for water retention reduces water provision, thereby decreasing soil erosion (Liu et al., 2003). In addition, the natural forests in our study had relatively high values of soil conservation, water retention, and carbon storage; however, the overall benefits were lower than in mixed C. lanceolata and M. macclurei forests, mixed P. massoniana and S. superba forests, M. macclurei forests, and P. elliottii forests, especially in timber production service. Note that the ecosystem services of plantation forests, mixture or monoculture, change with age, structure, site quality and management practices, etc. In the Huitong Experimental Forest, we had a similar site quality and management practices; therefore, the age and structure of plantations may be the main explanation for this result. For example, all of the plantations we selected to compare with natural forests were mature forests, and only highly productive species were planted, including C. lanceolata and P. massoniana. These findings also confirmed that some plantations, especially the mixed plantations, can provide higher levels of multiple ecosystem services than natural forests. Consequently, an appropriate mixture of tree species can effectively maximize the overall benefits of multiple ecosystem services with an aim toward sustainable forest management. The InVEST model used in this study has some limitations. This model is a simple tool that does not account for complex parameters or require much expertise, which typically focuses on the relative relationships between multiple services in various scenarios rather than the accurate prediction of one particular service (Brauman et al., 2007;Vigerstol and Aukema, 2011;Sharp et al., 2015;Hamel et al., 2015).",

In a restoration project at a former mining site in Ghana, ecosystem services (ES) proxies in an actively restored forest were compared to a local agroforestry system and a natural forest. The results provide information about trade-offs and synergies between proxies of multiple ES(s). ES proxies were assessed according to the following categories: (a) food-tree ES: biomass of food and fodder trees, (b) other trees ES: biomass of fuelwood, medicine or mulch trees, (c) ES-providing arthropods: the number of detritivorous and predaceous arthropods, (d) carbon storage, and (e) tree diversity. Eight replicated plots with sizes of 20 m \u00d7 20 m were established in each forest type, and the following ES proxies were quantified: tree diversity was estimated as taxonomic richness of all trees with a diameter at breast height \u2265 10 cm in each plot. Tree species were then classified into ES categories (food, fodder, fuelwood, medicine, or mulch). Ground-dwelling arthropods were sampled for 10 weeks with five pitfall traps in each plot and categorized as decomposers and predators. Tree above-ground biomass was estimated based on the measured tree diameter, height, and specific wood density using an improved allometric equation. The above-ground biomass was later converted into carbon storage by assuming 50% of the above-ground biomass of each tree. ES proxies based on tree biomass were highest in the natural forest. Fodder, medicine, fuelwood, and mulch ES proxies were significantly higher in the restored forest than the agroforestry system. Decomposer arthropods were most dominant in the natural forest, followed by the restored forest and the agroforestry system. Predacious arthropods were more dominant in the restored forest than in the other forest types.

In 2019, about 11.9 million hectares of tree cover was lost in the tropics (Weisse and Goldman, 2020). Between 2010 and 2015, Ghana lost about 0.6% of its protected forest reserves because of factors such as illegal logging, encroachment for farming, and wildfire (Acheampong et al., 2019). Globally, deforestation is known as a major driver for the substantial loss of biodiversity and a decline in the provision of ecosystem services (ES) (Ciccarese et al., 2012) that affects numerous people worldwide [United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification [UNCCD], 2014]. The productivity of food systems that local communities depend on for their livelihoods is severely affected by ongoing deforestation (Nunoo et al., 2015). One approach to revert losses from deforestation and mitigate consequences for local communities is active restoration, for example, with multi-purpose tree species that are capable of providing several ES (Reubens et al., 2011;Gamfeldt et al., 2013;Zemp et al., 2019). Deforestation often affects climatic variability leading to either prolonged drought or flooding which both impact food production (Chirwa and Adeyemi, 2019). Active restoration involves the direct planting of seeds or seedlings to aid the recovery of deforested and degraded lands to reach a predefined restoration aim (Morrison and Lindell, 2011;Crouzeilles et al., 2017). The success of restoration activities often is measured by improvement of soil fertility, carbon sequestration and the recovery of biodiversity in general (Chazdon, 2008). The benefits provided by restored ecosystems to local communities should be an additional focus of restoration programs (Erbaugh et al., 2020).",

The introduction of a new tree species or the loss of a certain species from a particular area may alter levels of various ES (Brockerhoff et al., 2017). Active restoration directly affects the establishment of tree species but further indirectly alters the composition of biotic communities in restored areas by its effects on functionally important organisms such as predators (e.g., spiders) of forest pests (e.g., silk and carpenter moths) or decomposers (e.g., woodlice) which contribute to nutrient cycles (Fragoso and Varanda, 2011;Nicholls and Altieri, 2013;Kremen et al., 2018;Donkersley, 2019;Luong et al., 2019). Ecosystem services include provisioning (e.g., food, fodder, energy), regulating (e.g., climate and pest regulation, carbon sequestration), and other indirect supporting services that are required for the production of the provisioning and regulating services (e.g., soil formation, nutrient cycling, primary production) [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [MEA], 2005]. These services are associated to several groups of so called service-providing organisms performing related ecosystem functions (Luck et al., 2003). For instance, predators regulate crop pests as natural enemies, and detritivorous insects decompose dead organic matter contributing to nutrient cycling and thereby to improved agriculture production and carbon sequestration (Birkhofer et al., 2015). In addition to these services, ecosystems also produce some disservices (hereafter Ecosystem Disservice-EDS; Lyytim\u00e4ki and Sipil\u00e4, 2009), as for example pest infestations may lead to trade-offs with ES.",

Today, restoration and conservation activities often focus on simultaneously enhancing more than one ES and avoiding trade-offs, thereby creating synergies to meet the diverse needs of society (Birkhofer et al., 2018(Birkhofer et al., , 2019;;Shimamoto et al., 2018;Zeng et al., 2019). Ecosystem multifunctionality (EM) describes the ability of an ecosystem to supply multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously to satisfy different societal needs and preferences (Mander et al., 2007;H\u00f6lting et al., 2019). Manning et al. (2018) emphasized the importance of high biodiversity for the provision of ES because different species contribute to different ecosystem functions. The EM approach hence integrates measures of the relative supply of multiple ecosystem functions and services to evaluate multiple restoration targets based on a high number of individual indicators (Strobl et al., 2019). The multifunctional nature of ecosystems and the proposed multifunctionality approach cause the need to consider synergies and trade-offs between ES and functions (Raudsepp-Hearne et al., 2010;Gamfeldt et al., 2013;Pe\u00f1a et al., 2018). Berry et al. (2020), for example, discussed synergistic relationships between carbon storage and biodiversity, whereby the provision on one allowed for greater levels of the other. Damptey et al. (2020) also highlighted that higher tree biodiversity in actively restored forests goes along with improved soil conditions, providing support for the assumption that higher biodiversity enhances EM. However, trade-offs, on the other hand, occur when the increase in one ES leads to a decrease in another ES (Bennett et al., 2009;Birkhofer et al., 2015;Lafond et al., 2017).",

In this study, we analyzed the levels and relationships between proxies of multiple ES in three different forest types (actively restored forest, agroforestry system, and natural forest in Ghana). The restored forest is a previous gravel mine site that was replanted with both native and exotic trees species after soil amendments (Damptey et al., 2020). ES proxies were assessed in the following categories: (a) food-related tree ES (biomass of food and fodder trees), (b) other trees ES (biomass of fuelwood, medicine or mulch trees), (c) ES providing arthropods (number of decomposers and predators), (d) carbon storage, and (e) tree diversity. The resulting data was then used to analyze the performance of multiple ES proxies in the three alternative forest types and to identify trade-offs and synergies between foodrelated ES (a) and other ES proxies (b-e). Major objectives of this study are to assess how active forest restoration 20 years after the initiation of restoration practices (i) determined levels of individual ES proxies compared to alternative forest types and if (ii) synergies or trade-offs between food-related and other ES proxies are evident across forest types. We hypothesize that active forest restoration enhances levels of food and fodder ES compared to the natural forest and to a lesser extent compared to the agroforestry system.

Active restoration promoted selected ES (fodder tree biomass and predator numbers) compared to agroforestry in our study. However, levels of ES proxies in the natural forest were at least comparable or higher to the highest levels in agroforestry and actively restored forest plots for all ES proxies that differed significantly between forest types. Considering the ES proxies quantified in this study, optimal levels are only provided by the natural forest, followed by the actively restored forest which holds an intermediate position between natural and agroforestry plots showing the lowest benefits.

The main cause of rising atmospheric temperature is human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission that build up in the atmosphere over a long time. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advocates limiting global atmospheric temperature rise 2\u02daC above pre-industrial era so that concentrations of CO 2 remains stable at 490-540 ppm (NOAA 2019). This would require GHG emissions reduction by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050 (USGCRP 2018). Therefore, an increase in the sequestration rate of global carbon (C) pool through plantation and forest ecosystems could be efficient measures for mitigation of high atmospheric carbon concentrations. Trees, herbaceous tissues, and woody perennial products are natural reservoir for C storehouses which act as carbon removal agents from our atmosphere. The world's C balance involves the vital position of the world's forests, which make up 30.6% of global land area and stores 296 Gt C in both the above and below ground portion, accounting for roughly three-quarters of all carbon in the atmosphere (Rabha et al. 2014;Saatchi et al. 2011). Roughly 40% of the global soil C is present in forest ecosystems (Hudson et al. 1994). Tropical forests contributes 46% to the world's terrestrial biomass carbon pool (Brown et al. 1989) and 11% to the world's soil carbon pool (Rabha et al. 2014).

About 70% of the fast growing species and 30% long-rotation species were included in forest plantation under joint effort of the various State Forest Departments and the Forest Corporations. In degraded forest patches, species like teak (Tectona grandis L.f.), sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn), and garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus Gaertn) were regenerated and planted along with long-rotation tree species to satisfy the growing needs of industry (MoEF 2009). Dipterocarps are the most well-known trees in the tropics (Appanah 1998) that have immense ecological and economical importance especially to the lowland rain forests (Whitmore 1975). These trees are well represented in the understory as emergent stratum (Appanah 1998) while certain Dipterocarp species dominates the fire-climax deciduous forests of northeast India and Indo-Burma (Appanah and Turnbull 1998). These forests contribute immensely to economy of many southeast Asian countries due to their timber demand (Deb et al. 2017;Appanah and Turnbull 1998). The increasing habitat destruction due to anthropogenic pressure coupled with climate change are some of the key threats to Asian Dipterocarp forests that need immediate preservation. The dominant Dipterocarp trees like sal (S. robusta) and garjan (D. turbinatus) form specific assemblage of canopies in different forest types of southeast Asia (Deb et al. 2017;Appanah and Turnbull 1998;Gautam and Devoe 2006).

Shifting cultivation and other anthropogenic activities are major forest disturbances in the region (Sahoo et al. 2008;Li et al. 2018;Gogoi et al. 2017;Gogoi and Sahoo 2018) and some studies have shown that forests can significantly improve ecosystem carbon stock if disturbances are not allowed or minimized (Gogoi et al. 2020;Thong et al. 2020). Similarly, community conservation (Deb et al. 2021) and planted forests have tremendous ability to sequester significant amount of atmospheric carbon (Gogoi et al. 2021;Singh et al. 2018). Species richness/tree diversity and basal area are important measurements of vegetation in natural ecosystems. Species richness nevertheless promote resource use and better nutrient retention and thus, provide better ecosystem services (Williams et al. 2017). Many studies have shown that species richness positively affect above-and below-ground C storage (Ruiz-Benito et al. 2014), soil C storage (Gamfeldt et al. 2013) and increase ecosystem carbon storage, and therefore it is suggested to consider multispecies plantation instead of monoculture to increase C fixation (Li et al. 2018).

The carbon component of this biomass was estimated to be 2.4 and 4.5 tonnes/ha carbon, equivalent to 8.7 and 16.5 tonnes/ha carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sequestered, respectively. These are lower than previous estimates for plantings of the same age in the same landscape. This is largely due to lower planting densities of 200 stems/ha, and 883 stems/ha respectively, for woodland and riparian plantings, relative to comparable plantings (\u02dc1,000 stems/ha).

As the world strives to reach net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 (IPCC 2018), substantial value has been attached to carbon (Ackerman andStanton 2010, Nordhaus 2017;Ricke et al. 2018). Consequently, there is need to obtain estimates of the biomass and carbon stored in the complex vegetation (singleand multi-stemmed trees and shrubs) created by environmental plantings. This requirement has involved the development of generic allometric equations (Jonson and Freudenberger, 2011, Paul et al. 2013, 2016, 2019;Prior et al. 2015) that estimate plant biomass (aboveand below-ground) based on simple measurements such as stem diameter at breast height (DBH, measured at 1.3-m above-ground). In Australia, much environmental restoration has been focused on medium to low rainfall areas (400-800 mm annual rainfall), land originally occupied by open forests and woodlands (Prior et al. 2015) and subsequently cleared for farming (Freudenberger 2018). The Midlands of Tasmania provide an excellent example of this where environmental plantings were established to provide connectivity for wildlife, as described in Davidson et al. (2021a this issue). Revegetation was challenging operationally (Davidson et al. 2021b this issue) in an environment characterised by past establishment failures (Close and Davidson 2003). A complex range of interventions were needed to overcome the constraints on plant survival in this highly altered farming landscape (Davidson et al. 2021b this issue) subject to a harsh and changing climate (Harrison 2021 this issue) and high browsing pressure from native and introduced herbivores (Bailey et al. 2021, this issue).",

We selected a site with a homogeneous Typic Acric Red -Yellow Latosol (Anionic Acrustox). Part of this site was maintained under native vegetation (grassy cerrado C 4 -dominated), and part was planted with riparian species (C 3 ) in 1992. Litter and soil samples were collected and analysed (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, d 13 C isotopic analysis, and SOM density fractionation). Due to the predominance of grasses, carbon input was mainly below ground in cerrado. In such a soil, the decomposition process was more efficient, and much C and N were transferred to the heavy fraction. When forest was planted, there was a change from belowground to aboveground litter input (largely superficial), leading to higher C and N stocks in the light and lower stocks in the heavy fraction (resulting in lower stocks for bulk soil). The introduction of the C 3 vegetation decreased the soil d 13 C signature. It has occurred particularly in the topsoil (0 -5 cm) due to the deposition of C 3 litter on the soil surface. At the same time, the presence of cerrado-remaining C below 5 cm maintained higher d 13 C values in this layer. During the 8 years after forest plantation, the input mode influenced both the d 13 C distribution with depth, and the C replacement: between 0 and 2.5 cm, nearly 50% of cerrado-derived C was replaced by forest-derived C, while below 5 cm, replacement was around 20%. The relatively rapid C dynamics in this Oxisol (27% replacement in the top 20 cm after 8 years of forest plantation) shows that, under tropical conditions, significant changes may occur in a short period of time.",

Due to their location, riparian forests are particularly threatened. A large incentive was given to the study of alternatives to preserve or recover such forests in the centre -south region of Brazil, where they have been highly disturbed. Consequently, many programs of riparian vegetation reestablishment appeared in the late 1980s, aiming at technological research on reforestation models in the vicinity of hydroelectric reservoirs. The ''Riparian Forest Proj-ect'', one of the first Brazilian programs, was implemented in the Itutinga/Camargos (Minas Gerais State) reservoirs in 1990. The native vegetation still prevails and lakeside areas covered by ''cerrado'' (Brazilian savannah), which varies from grassland to woodland, can still be found. A small part of the shores was replanted with riparian species (C 3 vegetation), including some areas originally covered by grassy cerrado (predominantly C 4 vegetation). Very little work has been done on the evaluation of forestation and reforestation programs in Brazil and most of it does not focus on soil organic matter (SOM). Greater knowledge about carbon stocks and SOM fractions is necessary to elucidate carbon storage in tropical conditions, especially when there is a conversion between C 3 and C 4 vegetation or vice versa. It is well known that the discrimination between the two stable isotopes of carbon, 13 C and 12 C, in favour of the lighter 12 C, in photosynthetic reactions, is dominated by the primary carboxylation steps, particularly the reaction catalysed by ribulose biphosphate carboxylase. As the primary carboxylation step occurs in C 3 plants but not in C 4 plants, the degree of discrimination against 13 C is greater in C 3 plants (O'Leary, 1981).",
        "e6de1171-3b9e-49bb-906a-13bede504be7": "Soil organic matter roughly inherits the isotope signature of the contributing vegetation, and therefore the carbon isotopic composition of SOM is a function of the relative contribution of C 3 and/or C 4 plants to the soil organic C pool (Midwood and Boutton, 1998;Boutton et al., 1998). Carbon-13 fractionation during transformation of plant residues into SOM is smaller than the difference between C 3 and C 4 litter. A replacement of vegetation that involves a change of dominant photosynthetic pathway will gradually change the isotopic composition: the introduction of C 3 plants (d 13 Ci \u00c0 27x) to a soil previously developed under C 4 vegetation (d 13 Ci \u00c0 13x), or vice versa, causes an in situ labelling of new organic matter incorporated into the soil (Lefroy et al., 1993). This can be used to evaluate the dynamics of the carbon incorporated when such conversion occurs. In Brazilian soils, the isotopic composition method has been used to reconstruct past vegetation changes (Pessenda et al., 1996;Martinelli et al., 1996) and to better understand SOM dynamics after vegetation conversion (e.g., Cerri and Andreux, 1990;Cerri et al., 1985;Feigl et al., 1995;Roscoe et al., 2001). Different mixing models can be used to estimate the C sources proportion (C 3 or C 4 vegetation). Basically, two models (Balesdent and Mariotti, 1996) are found in the literature: one considers similar 13 C fractionation during decomposition for both new and old vegetation; the other does not account for any fractionation upon humification of the newly introduced material. Their application involves a large number of input variables in order to estimate C origin. Each input variable has its own variability and the uncertainties are combined through the calculations, resulting in cumulative error.",

A recent work with Brazilian soils (Roscoe and Buurman, 2003) has successfully used their approach. Physical fractionation (density and particle-size analysis) of soil organic matter with application of ultrasonic energy has been applied in several studies of SOM stability (Christensen, 1987;Shang and Tiessen, 1997), of changes caused by cultivation (Cambardella and Elliot, 1994), and of systems sustainability (Feigl et al., 1995). Density fractionation allows a better understanding of SOM dynamics through separation of the light fraction ( < 1.7 g cm \u00c0 3 ) from the heavy fraction (>1.7 g cm \u00c0 3 ). While the first one still has litter characteristics and a fast decomposition rate, the heavy fraction consists mainly of highly decomposed material, with a much slower decomposition rate (Golchin et al., 1995). In this work, we combined physical fractionation and carbon isotopic analysis to evaluate the impact of planted riparian forests on soils previously under grassy cerrado on SOM dynamics in a Brazilian Latosol (Oxisol).",

Almost all the existing plantations have been established after the 1950s and consist of fast-growing exotic trees such as species of Eucalyptus, Pinus and Acacia along with teak and mahogany (Vivekanandan, 1987). In addition to their industrial timber products, the importance of forest plantations has increased substantially during the last two decades, in view of the increased awareness on global climate change and the role of forests in regulating the global carbon cycle (Dixon et al., 1994;Clark et al., 2003;Clark, 2004a;Houghton, 2005). Forests have the ability to absorb large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide for their photosynthesis and sequester carbon in their biomass (Chambers et al., 2001). As carbon dioxide is the principal greenhouse gas contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect (Houghton, 1997) and the consequent global warming, which drives climate change, forests have the potential to reduce the rate of global warming and the resultant climate change (Brown et al., 1996;Cannell, 1996;Sathaye & Ravindranath, 1998;Malhi & Grace, 2000;White et al., 2000;Schulze et al., 2000;Baker et al., 2004;Grace & Meir, 2009;Lewis et al., 2009). However, increasing deforestation of natural forests, especially in the tropics, is reducing the global warming mitigation potential of tropical forests and threatens to convert them from a significant global carbon sink to a net carbon source (Clark, 2002;2004b, 2007;Lewis, 2006). Therefore, plantation forestry forms an important option for climate change mitigation (IPCC, 2007;Nabuurs et al., 2007).",

While the rate of biomass production (i.e. increase of forest biomass per year) indicates the potential of a forest to absorb atmospheric CO 2 and reduce global warming within a given time period, the standing biomass of a forest indicates how much carbon has been sequestered during its lifetime. Although Sri Lanka contains nearly 65,000 ha of forest plantations, their carbon stocks as indicated by the standing biomass, have not been estimated. The published research literature on the growth of plantation forest species in Sri Lanka reports only the height and diameter at breast-height (dbh) increments over relatively short periods of time at a limited number of locations (Vivekanandan, 1979;Phillips & Weerawardena, 1991a, b, c, d;Weerawardena & Phillips, 1991a, b). Therefore, the objective of the present work was to estimate the total carbon (C) stocks of plantation forests in Sri Lanka and examine the contribution from different tree species in different locations and climatic zones. Estimates of C stocks will enable economic valuation of Sri Lankan plantation forests to explore possibilities of financial gains through mechanisms such as the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries Programme (UN-REDD) (Gibbs et al., 2007;Ravels, 2008;Schwartzman et al., 2008). C stock estimates could also form the basis for analysis of benefits and costs of afforestation or reforestation with forest plantations in quantifying their climate change mitigation potential (Sathaye et al., 2001;2007;Strengers et al., 2007;Ben\u00edtez-Ponce et al., 2008).

Within this basin, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the largest forest surface in continental Africa, covering 134 million hectares and including many different forest types (FAO, 2005). Still, deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics continue at an alarming rate. Between 1990 and 2000, 0.21% of the Central African forest disappeared annually and almost 0.15% was degraded every year (Duveiller et al., 2008). Ecologically, sustainable forest management means that the management should not impair the ecological functions of the forest. This general concept, however, is quite difficult to achieve and to monitor and gives rise to controversy. Therefore the concept of sustained yield is being advocated as a more robust means to evaluate the non-detrimental character of timber logging and trade (Sands, 2005). Applying the principle of sustained yield implies that log removals should not exceed the capacity of the growing populations to replace them (annual growth = annual allowable cut). It is probably not the single unique condition (as other factors such as sociological and ecological parameters could also be taken into account), but the concept is generally accepted as a basic principle of forest management aiming at sustainability (Sands, 2005). Tropical plantations seemed to play a minor role in the debate on sustainable management. However, when these plantations are created on degraded or agricultural land and carefully designed with respect to the local people, they can provide several environmental and socio-economic benefits (Evans and Turnbull, 2004). Lugo (1992) showed that the understory of older plantations can develop a high species richness with many native tree species. Thus, plantations can help in maintaining and restoring the diversity and productivity of forests after human-induced disruption. On the other hand, they can also provide a way to meet the national and international wood demand and to contribute to the country's economy (Marien and Mallet, 2004).",

About half of that area is located in the tropics and subtropics with no more than 10% in Africa (FAO, 2005). Other arguments in favour of plantations are often found in the ongoing debate on climate change and global warming. Indeed, forests contain a large fraction of the terrestrial biomass, which underlines their importance as carbon sinks. The elemental composition of wood regarding the main components is relatively similar for all wood species, with carbon as the main component accounting for 50% of the woody biomass (Rowell, 2005). Kraenzel et al. (2003) measured a mean carbon content of 49.2% in teak. Elias and Potvin (2003) measured the carbon content of 32 neotropical species and found similar results although the wood carbon fraction may exhibit some small across species variations. Still, carbon content can be considered as half of the woody biomass. There is an increased interest to quantify this global carbon cycle under the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol because it offers an interesting tool to finance sustainable forest management. Volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) may be considered as the two main estimates within the framework of sustainable management and the mitigation of climate change. Measurements of both volume and AGB are difficult and time consuming (especially in tropical conditions), so often they are estimated from tree characteristics such as diameter or height, using allometric equations. The selection of the appropriate allometric model is a key element in the accurate estimation of volume and biomass (Navar, 2009). The requirements for these allometric equations are identical, so classical forest inventories provide all the necessary data (Brown, 1997). Still, allometric equations are a simplified way of estimating volume and biomass by taking measures of diameter and/or height.

In these short-rotation plantations, teak (Kraenzel et al., 2003;Ola-Adams, 1993), Eucalyptus spp. (Fonweban and Houllier, 1997;Forrester et al., 2004) and Acacia spp. (Bernhard-Reversat et al., 1993;Forrester et al., 2004) make up the majority of research projects. A few studies on AGB of short-rotation plantations with indigenous tree species like Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels (DRC and Nigeria) and Nauclea diderichii (De Wild.) Merr.

In the 1930s, massive harvests of limba endangered the survival of this most abundant species throughout the Mayombe Forest, a natural forest covering parts of Gabon, the Republic of Congo, the DRC and Angola. Because of the natural presence of homogeneous stands, a straight stem, the ease of installing seedbeds and nursing seedlings and good natural pruning capacities, approximately 15 000 ha of limba plantations were established around the Biosphere Reserve of Luki (Lower Congo Province, DRC) since the early 1940s (Humblet, 1946). Normally, half of the initial planting density was planned to be removed by thinnings but even without silvicultural treatments, most of the Congolese plantations of Terminalia superba could be considered as successful (Marien and Mallet, 2004). The combination of large-scale plantations in Central Africa with an indigenous tree species and an age of more than 50 y offers a unique opportunity for research. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of limba plantations around the Reserve of Luki in terms of wood and biomass production, including the sequestration of carbon.

This biome presents high richness in biodiversity, high levels of endemism, and environmental functions of global importance (Gomes et al., 2018;Strassburg et al., 2017).

Faced with this scenario, the forest sector has as challenge to reestablish forest cover in degraded areas to meet the current and growing demand for wood for the industry and carbon sequestration, while limiting the pressure for exploitation in the remaining natural forests (Ferreira et al., 2018;Hulvey et al., 2013;Kunert and C\u00e1rdenas, 2015;C.

Usually, the main reason for choosing these plantations are the ecological factors, however, the mixtures can also be more productive than monocultures in some cases (Hulvey et al., 2013;C. L. C. Liu et al., 2018;Marron and Epron, 2019;Petit and Montagnini, 2006). One of the challenges is to define the list of species to be planted, which should be established regionally by using species adapted to the environmental conditions of the planting region. Native tree species are naturally indicated as most suitable for mixed stands (Wang and Meng, 2018). However, there is little information on the growth behavior of native species in a mixed stand in Cerrado regions. Thus, monitoring the growth of species planted in a given area can provide fundamental information to support the establishment of new areas with mixed species. Given the above, our objective was to evaluate the growth of native forest species in a mixed plantation in a Cerrado area. The hypotheses of this research were: (1) the mixed plantation is efficient in the vegetation recovery, biomass accumulation, and carbon sequestration in deforested Cerrado areas; (2) the species present different growth form, and few species are responsible for the greater occupation of the area.",

Overall, the stocks in G, V, B and C recorded at 6.4 years old were similar or higher than those found in other mixed plantations with native species or even in areas with natural plant formations in Brazil. The basal area in experimental plantations with age 4-5 years, in two sites in the Atlantic Forest region, had about 7 m 2 ha -1 in plantations consisting of only native species, 14 m 2 ha -1 in plantations of native species intercropped with Eucalyptus, and 17 m 2 ha -1 in single Eucalyptus plantations (Amazonas et al., 2018b). The biomass above ground recorded in these areas was about 10 Mg ha -1 for the mixed planting of native species and about 110 Mg ha -1 for the native species intercropped with Eucalyptus (Brancalion et al., 2019a). The wood production found in natural formations of the Brazilian Savanna were 24.56 Mg ha -1 to 126.92 Mg ha -1 for biomass stocks (Miguel et al *Species coded in descending order of DBHeq.

The biomass accumulation in the present study was also higher than that found in a central Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado sensu stricto), resulting from the natural regeneration of woody vegetation monitored for 27 years after the application of silvicultural systems, with cutting and removal of woody vegetation (19.54-26.07 Mg ha -1 ) (Azevedo et al., 2020). These authors also observed that a period of 17 years was sufficient for woody vegetation to recover its initial biomass stocks and that the biomass levels recorded at 23 and 27 years after cutting were approximately 2.6 times greater than those recorded before the installation of forestry systems. Thus, our results show that the use of a mixed forest species in the restoration of deforested areas is a good strategy to recover ecosystem functions of natural forests, mainly the accumulation of biomass and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, in relatively short time periods. The greater growth of tree species in less time ensures rapid occupation of the area, which can create suitable conditions for regenerating the most advanced succession species, represent great environmental benefits, and prevent increased damage caused by soil exposure (Brancalion et al., 2015;Vijith et al., 2018;Zuazo and Pleguezuelo, 2008).

The largest occupation of the study area was promoted by the species with the highest growth, clustered by PCA in groups 1 and 2. The species of group 1 (H. popayanensis, C. floribundus) represented only 5.8% of the number of individuals in the area, but contributed with 18.2%, 18.7% and 13.8% to the stocks of G, V and B accumulated in the area, respectively. These species had the largest NSI, which favored their greater occupation of the area. They are pioneer species, resistant to unfavorable environmental conditions, with fast growing and often recommended in mixed plantations of forest restoration or recovery of degraded soils (Lorenzi, 2016).

Overall, the species have different shares in the biomass stock even in natural ecosystems, and generally few species are responsible for a large fraction of the biomass accumulated in the area (Azevedo et al., 2020;Souza and Soares, 2013). The species in groups 3 and 4, with 41.4% of the individuals in the area, contributed only 13.3% of G, 8.9% of V, and 9.9% of B stocked in the area. The lower growth of these species in the study area can be explained mainly by the specific characteristics of each one, especially regarding the natural growth habit. Furthermore, in native tropical forests, species tend to guide their development, mainly based on light tolerance. Slower development is expected for species with lower light tolerance (Maciel et al., 2017). Some of the species with low growth in this study are widely used in the recovery of degraded areas, such as C. fissilis (Gonzalo et al., 2015), L. divaricata (Fragoso et al., 2016), S. molle and S. terebinthifolia (Nascimento et al., 2012). Although some species have limited growth, their use in forest restoration programs is of great importance.",

These species contribute to the temporal perpetuation of the woody community after the decline of fast-growing and short-life species, since there is a gradual substitution of species in the area (Azevedo et al., 2020;Brancalion et al., 2015). Therefore, successful plantations with mixed species should combine fast and slow growing, short and long life cycle, shade tolerant and non-shade tolerant, surface and deep rooting, and nitrogen fixing and non-nitrogen fixing species, in addition to different canopy occupations (Liu et al., 2018). Furthermore, in mixed plantations, the different species contribute to increasing the diversity of the area, increasing the biomass and carbon stored in the soil and the forest, and providing additional ecosystem services (Anbarashan et al., 2019;Hulvey et al., 2013;X. Liu et al., 2018). Our findings demonstrate the potential for growth of forest species in mixed plantation mainly aimed at the recovery of degraded areas. Although our experiment was implemented in a Cerrado environment, the species used has a wide geographic distribution, with natural occurrence in several biomes and are not endemic to Brazil (Table 2). This indicates that these species can be used for vegetation restoration in several ecosystems. Additionally, there is a worldwide trend of replacing uniform and monospecific forest stands by irregular or mixed stands (D\u0103nescu et al., 2018;Lamb, 2011), aiming also to obtain forest products. Therefore, the adoption of mixed plantations is an opportunity to combine the obtaining of services and products from the forest (Amazonas et al., 2018a;Gong et al., 2020;Hulvey et al., 2013), providing ecological and socioeconomic advantages over traditional monocultures (Nguyen et al., 2018;Petit and Montagnini, 2006).",

        "fea34c1e-0fbf-4956-b62c-b0a65eff3891": "Mangroves can capture and store organic carbon and their protection and therefore their restoration is a component of climate change mitigation. However, there are few empirical measurements of long-term carbon storage in mangroves or of how storage varies across environmental gradients. The context dependency of this process combined with geographically limited field sampling has made it difficult to generalize regional and global rates of mangrove carbon sequestration. This has in turn hampered the inclusion of sequestration by mangroves in carbon cycle models and in carbon offset markets. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative carbon capture and storage potential in natural and restored mangrove forests. We measured depth profiles of soil organic carbon content in 72 cores collected from six sites (three natural, two restored, and one afforested) surrounding Muisne, Ecuador. Samples up to 1 m deep were analyzed for organic matter content using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted ratio of 1.72 (g/g). Results suggest that average soil carbon storage is 0.055 \u00b1 0.002 g cm -3 (11.3 \u00b1 0.8% carbon content by dry mass, mean \u00b1 1 SE) up to 1 m deep in natural sites, and 0.058 \u00b1 0.002 g cm -3 (8.0 \u00b1 0.3%) in restored sites. These estimates are concordant with published global averages. Evidence of equivalent carbon stocks in restored and afforested mangrove patches emphasizes the carbon sink potential for reestablished mangrove systems. We found no relationship between sediment carbon storage and aboveground biomass, forest structure, or within-patch location. Our results demonstrate the long-term carbon storage potential of natural mangroves, high effectiveness of mangrove restoration and afforestation, a lack of predictability in carbon storage strictly based on aboveground parameters, and the need to establish standardized protocol for quantifying mangrove sediment carbon stocks.",
        "8689c189-7a25-408f-8756-bac34b88607f": "The concentration of atmospheric CO 2 has increased by forty-percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution and continues to increase concentrations by 2 ppm annually (Dedysh, Derakshani & Liesack, 2001;Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2012). As a result, we face a warming planet, rising seas, changing precipitation patterns, and decreasing biodiversity (2012). Identifying effective, efficient, and politically acceptable approaches to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 is thus one of society's most pressing goals. Reducing atmospheric CO 2 via carbon sequestration-transferring carbon to a safe biological or geological reservoir-is one such solution. Terrestrial vegetation plays a key role in the global carbon cycle as both a sink and a source of anthropogenic CO 2 : total forest carbon uptake is 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 Pg C yr -1 (Pan et al., 2011), whereas the loss of vegetation via land use change adds 1.1 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C yr -1 . While terrestrial forests as a whole are a net sink, tropical land use change emits 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C yr -1 (Pan et al., 2011). Conservation of existing vegetation is therefore critical for preventing further carbon emissions as well as for preserving carbon sequestration potential. Despite the greater area of terrestrial carbon sinks (Schlesinger, 1997), coastal carbon sinks have comparable global carbon sequestration values: total global carbon uptake in mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is estimated at 84-233 Tg C yr -1 and uptake in terrestrial systems is estimated at 180.8 Tg C yr -1 (Donato et al., 2011;McLeod et al., 2011). In coastal ecosystems, high rates of uptake reflect high sediment accumulation rates ranging from 18 to 1713 g C m -2 yr -1 (McLeod et al., 2011); organic carbon burial occurs as sediment is accreted vertically during periods such as the present, when sea level is rising (Ellison, 2008).",
        "867469e6-8aed-465c-ae91-295ba360e252": "On an aerial basis, mangroves display some of the highest rates of carbon burial and storage among vegetated habitats, sequestering 2.26 \u00b1 0.39 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 and storing an estimated 1,023 Mg C ha -1 in aboveground and sediment stores combined (Donato et al., 2011;McLeod et al., 2011). Their elaborate root structures slow the rate of water movement and thereby create an environment conducive for the settling of clay and silt particles (Wolanski, 1995;Young & Harvey, 1996). The carbon buried in these systems has been traced to not only autochthonous sources such as litterfall, benthic macroalgae, and root decay, but also imported sources such as seagrass and phytoplankton detritus, showing that mangrove forests provide broad-scale sink benefits (Kristensen, 2007;McLeod et al., 2011). International carbon marketing systems such as REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) place forest conservation projects in the context of the global carbon offsets market. Such marketing requires accounting for the dynamic nature of accumulation rates over temporal and geographic scales which are still not fully understood (Alongi, 2011). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that mangrove conservation (in a carbon trading context) is more valuable for preventing carbon release from deforestation than for continuously accounting for new sequestration (Alongi, 2011;Donato et al., 2012;Fourqurean et al., 2012). Mangrove deforestation generates emissions of 0.02-0.12 Pg annually C yr -1 , the equivalent of 2-10% of emissions from tropical deforestation despite the fact that global mangrove area is <1% of that of tropical forest area (van der Werf et al., 2009;Giri et al., 2011;Donato et al., 2012;Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2012).",
        "db366378-f288-4a1a-9a8e-2c6c3051b30d": "Nearly half of the world's mangroves forests have already been cleared, and the recent deforestation rate is roughly 1-3% annually (Alongi, 2002;Bouillon et al., 2008;Donato et al., 2011). Mangroves are usually cleared for development or conversion to aquaculture (Alongi, 2002). Upon clearing, both the aboveground biomass and sediment carbon stores are disturbed and/or aerated, increasing microbial activity (Granek & Ruttenberg, 2008;Couwenberg, Dommain & Joosten, 2010;Lovelock, Ruess & Feller, 2011;Pendleton et al., 2012). Though conservation of these ecosystems could be incentived by recognizing both their continuing sink potential and the adverse effects of deforestation via carbon release, the application of existing information to conservation initiatives is limited by a lack of empirical data. Most carbon storage and sequestration studies are from Florida, China, the Indo-Pacific, Australia, and the Brazilian coastline, despite global distribution of mangroves on coastlines between 0 and 30 degrees latitude (Fujimoto et al., 1999;Cebrian, 2002;Chmura et al., 2003). Mangrove storage and sequestration estimates in South America, especially on its Pacific coast, have been extremely rare thus far. In addition, methodological discrepancies have led to significantly different results which are difficult to interpret. Carbon storage and sequestration quantification is limited by a lack of concurrent data on depth, bulk density, carbon concentration, and sediment accumulation rates (Alongi, 2011;Donato et al., 2011). Finally, though the value of mangrove conservation can be inferred from previous observations of their natural state, little work has addressed the effectiveness of restoring these ecosystems in terms of carbon storage and sequestration (Laffoley & Grimsditch, 2009). The purpose of the study was to understanding how mangrove carbon storage varies with environmental context.",

Primarily, we asked how soil carbon standing stocks vary based on forest structure, locations within mangrove patches (defined here as continuous stands of mangroves), and patch land use history. Additionally, we examined how carbon concentration varies with soil depth in a given location and how these concentrations may be most accurately determined. We used these estimates to analyze the carbon storage efficiency of restoring mangroves in sites previously cleared for shrimp farming, and introducing mangroves to replace native vegetation.",

This paper synthesized 135 recent publications (844 observations at 181 sites) focused on the conversion from cropland to grassland, shrubland or forest in China, better known as the 'Grain-for-Green' Program to determine which factors were driving changes to soil organic carbon (SOC). The results strongly indicate a positive impact of cropland conversion on soil C stocks. The temporal pattern for soil C stock changes in the 0-100 cm soil layer showed an initial decrease in soil C during the early stage (<5 years), and then an increase to net C gains (>5 years) coincident with vegetation restoration. The rates of soil C change were higher in the surface profile (0-20 cm) than in deeper soil (20-100 cm). Cropland converted to forest (arbor) had the additional benefit of a slower but more persistent C sequestration capacity than shrubland or grassland. Tree species played a significant role in determining the rate of change in soil C stocks (conifer < broadleaf, evergreen < deciduous forests). Restoration age was the main factor, not temperature and precipitation, affecting soil C stock change after cropland conversion with higher initial soil C stock sites having a negative effect on soil C accumulation. Soil C sequestration significantly increased with restoration age over the long-term, and therefore, the large scale of land-use change under the 'Grain-for-Green' Program will significantly increase China's C stocks.",
        "41a97ed4-de79-4588-ace9-d4df35657e69": "Land-use change has a significant effect on the global carbon (C) cycle through changing soil C accumulation rates and turnover, soil erosion, and vegetation biomass (Post & Kwon, 2000;Fang et al., 2001;Lal, 2002;Degryze et al., 2004;Lagani ere et al., 2010;Li et al., 2012). Following the cultivation of land that was previously covered in perennial vegetation, soil organic carbon (SOC) can be rapidly lost due to enhanced C decomposition and erosion brought about by soil disturbance (Degryze et al., 2004;Lal, 2005;Van der Werf et al., 2009). Lal (2005) reported that up to 50% of soil C was lost within the first 20 years. In contrast, converting cropland into perennial vegetation is found to accumulate SOC by increasing C derived from the new vegetation thereby simultaneously decreasing C loss from decomposition and erosion (Guo & Gifford, 2002;Lal, 2004;Lagani ere et al., 2010;Chang et al., 2011;Deng et al., 2013). Thus, increasing forested land area through reforestation has become one of the major available strategies for climate change mitigation (IPCC, 2000;Vesterdal et al., 2002;Miles & Kapos, 2008;Zhang et al., 2010;Li et al., 2012), as proposed in Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 2005). Losses in soil C caused by the conversion of natural to cultivated vegetation is well documented (Yan et al., 2012). Globally, 24% of the SOC stock has been lost through the conversion of forest to cropland (Murty et al., 2002) and 59% through the conversion of pasture to cropland (Guo & Gifford, 2002).",
        "6909d244-c83f-4595-ad1b-18a3155ceff6": "In contrast, where cropland is withdrawn from farming and converted into natural vegetation, soil C accumulates and is locked up for greater periods of time due to the slower turnover rates associated with natural vegetation (Post & Kwon, 2000;Degryze et al., 2004;Zhang et al., 2010). Soil C stocks can be increased by preventing soil erosion (Lal, 2002), increasing organic matter inputs (Smith, 2008) and decreasing both weathering and microbial breakdown (Post & Kwon, 2000;Lal, 2005;Smith, 2008). Martens et al. (2003) found that soil C accumulated at an average rate of 0.62 and 1.60 Mg ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 during cropland conversion into pasture and secondary forest, respectively, in Central America. In China, an average gain of 0.37 Mg ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 has been estimated following the establishment of perennial vegetation on cropland (Zhang et al., 2010). Globally, Post and Kwon (2000) found that the average rates of soil C accumulation for forest and grassland established on land cultivated for 100 years were similar at 0.34 and 0.33 Mg ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , respectively. Guo and Gifford (2002) concluded that soil C stocks significantly increased when cropland was converted to pasture (+19%), tree plantation (+18%) and secondary forest (+53%). Importantly, however, Vesterdal et al. (2002) observed that afforestation on former arable land did not lead to an increase in SOC within 30 years, but instead led to the redistribution of SOC in the soil profile. A decrease in soil C was also found in the initial years (<5 years) following the abandonment of arable land (Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "a5eb78f3-1048-4fa8-ab81-4a82deebb35d": "The seeming inconsistencies drawn by these studies likely arise because the magnitude and direction of soil C dynamics are affected by multiple factors, including climate, soil type, soil depth, tree species, and nutrient management (Paul et al., 2002;Lal, 2004;Lagani ere et al., 2010;Li et al., 2012). Exploring the general patterns and the major factors controlling soil C accumulation is a necessary informational backdrop allowing ecosystem management practices to more precisely relate C sequestration values to either revegetation or afforestation (Post & Kwon, 2000;Lal, 2004;Li et al., 2012). Although several authors (Post & Kwon, 2000;Paul et al., 2002;Lagani ere et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2010;Chang et al., 2011) have analyzed the factors determining soil C stocks during the establishment of perennial vegetation, a consensus on the relative significance of these factors has yet to be achieved (Chang et al., 2011;Li et al., 2012). While Paul et al. (2002) found that climate is one of the most important factors influencing soil C change after cropland conversion, Lagani ere et al. (2010) concluded that climate had a smaller effect on soil C accumulation during afforestation when compared to previous land use, tree species planted, soil clay content and preplanting disturbance. Furthermore, the impact of these factors depends on spatial scale (Chang et al., 2011). For example, at a local scale, converting cropland to forest plantation had a greater effect on soil C sequestration than conversion to grassland (Del Galdo et al., 2003;Martens et al., 2003). At a national or global scale, the change in soil C stock was similar for grassland and forest establishment (Post & Kwon, 2000;Guo & Gifford, 2002;Zhang et al., 2010).",

In China, long-term agricultural exploitation has led to soil degradation and desertification (Lal, 2002;Wu et al., 2003), for example, SOC losses in cultivated soils of 7.1 Pg (Wu et al., 2003). In 1999, China launched the 'Grain-for-Green' Program (usually cropland is converted into grassland, shrubland or forest), one of the world's most ambitious conservation set-aside programs (Deng et al., 2012;Feng et al., 2013), and the nation's largest ecological restoration project since the 1970s (Cao et al., 2009). The large scale of land-use change undertaken for the 'Grain-for-Green' Program may indeed enhance C sequestration capacity in the terrestrial ecosystems of China, however, so far there has been little comprehensive assessment of the changes in soil C stocks for the entire program despite many observations made at the local level (Chang et al., 2011;Feng et al., 2013). At present, only one report has focused on changes in soil C stocks in surface soils (0-20 cm) (Zhang et al., 2010). It is also necessary to understand how the deeper soil C stock has changed since cropland conversion. To understand which factors drive soil C sequestration dynamics following cropland conversion it is crucial to explore both the rate of change and its temporal pattern.",

The purpose of this survey was to determine how well reforested mine sites in Indiana were performing in terms of values and services normally ascribed to native forest and what their future potential might be. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) was the most abundant species on 68% of the surveyed sites and accounted for 45% of all tallied trees and shrubs across all sites. Many black locust stands are currently experiencing decline and dieback caused, in part, by the locust borer. Forty percent of stands approached unmined planted tree height growth rates, while only 27% approached stem diameter growth rates of stands on unmined sites. Most reclaimed mine sites had measured site quality indices below the poorer quality sites in the region's native forests. Overall stocking in the establishment phase of stand development appeared adequate for future commercial timber production on many of the study sites. However, the dominance of black locust stocking in many stands limits their future viability for timber production. Tall fescue and serica lespedeza along with naturally occurring goldenrod were the most common ground covers in surveyed tree plantings. With few exceptions the reclaimed mine sites in this study show very low levels of productivity for forest products and carbon sequestration relative to native forests of this region, even though stocking levels appeared to be adequate. This suggests that the current bond performance measurement of 450 trees/acre bears little relevance to long term forest productivity. The results of this survey should serve as a baseline to determine the extent to which recent and future changes in reclamation methods improve reforestation success while meeting the other mandates of Indiana's mining regulatory program.",

However, the minimum stocking requirement for bond release does not necessarily equate to long term reforestation success. No attempt has ever been made to track the long term progress of reforested mine sites following bond release. In 2002 and 2003 a joint research team from Southern Illinois University, Department of Forestry and Purdue University Department of Forestry and Natural Resources conducted a survey of surface mines reforested from 1988 to 1995. The purpose of the survey was to determine how well reforested mine sites were performing in terms of values and services normally ascribed to native forest and what their future potential might be. The survey results are presented within the context of 1) long term forest health, 2) viability of reforested mine sites as future contributors to local economies, and 3) the viability of reforested mine sites as producers of environmental assets. Specifically this survey: 1. Determined post-bond release tree and shrub composition of the sites 2. Determined post-bond release tree growth and growth potential 3. Quantified post-bond release tree stocking 4. Determined post-bond release ground cover composition 5. Estimated carbon sequestration potential of tree stands on reclaimed mine sites.",

It is of interest to evaluate the potential of former coalfields for mitigating these increases by carbon sequestration and to compare different options to achieving this end. Here, carbon sequestration in residual coal seams and through reclamation of spoil tips is compared, and their carbon dioxide storage potential in the South Wales Coalfield estimated. Coal seam sequestration estimates come from an established methodology and consider the total unmined coal resource below 500m deep with potential for carbon sequestration. The most likely effective deep seam storage capacity is 104.9 Mt carbon dioxide, taking account of reservoir conditions and engineering factors. Whilst many spoil tips in South Wales have been reclaimed, the focus has not been on carbon sequestration potential. Estimates of minesoil restoration sequestration capacity were based on a survey of restored minesoil and vegetation carbon stocks, mainly on sites 20-30 years after restoration; data from this survey were then extrapolated to the coalfield as a whole.Minesoil storage is estimated at 1.5 or 2.5 Mt (+ 2.2 Mt in tree biomass) carbon dioxide based on average grassland or woodland measurements, respectively; modelled data predicted equilibrium values of 2.9 and 2.6 Mt carbon dioxide respectively in grassland or woodland minesoils. If all sites achieved close to the maximum capacity in their land use class, minesoil storage capacity would increase to 2.1 or 3.9 Mt carbon dioxide, respectively. Combining the best woodland minesoil and standing biomass values, sequestration capacity increases to 7.2 Mt carbon dioxide. The wider social, economic, environmental and regulatory constraints to achieving this sequestration for each approach are discussed. Coal seam sequestration has a much higher capacity but sequestration in mine sites is less costly and has fewer regulatory constraints. Findings indicate a significant combined potential for carbon sequestration in the South Wales Coalfield and highlight challenges in achieving this potential. On a global scale, ex-coalfield sequestration could contribute to broader efforts to mitigate emissions.",

In 2017, for example, it is provisionally estimated that UK net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were 366.9 million tonnes CO2 (MtCO2) (DECC, 2018). While the carbon intensity of the UK and wider world economy is falling, progress falls short of what is needed to limit global temperatures to 2 o C above pre-industrial levels (PwC, 2016). Geological carbon (C) sequestration aims to avoid or offset the atmospheric emission of CO2 and is prominent in strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Of most interest for C sequestration are deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coalbeds, and soils. There is now a pressing need to explore all options to not only reduce emissions, for example through the point source capture, utilisation and storage of CO2, but also to increase the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by introducing land management practices to enhance levels of soil C (The Royal Society and The Royal Academy of Engineering, 2018). Thus, the CO2 storage potential within the South Wales Coalfield, both below-ground in coal seams and above-ground in minesoil, is of interest. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in coal seams is an appealing option for Wales since there are significant remaining coal reserves in proximity to large point source emitters of CO2, such as the Port Talbot steel works (c. 6.6 MtCO2/year) (Thomas & Kluiters, 2013). Coalbeds provide in principle an attractive sink for captured CO2 since storage is predominantly in the sorbed phase, reducing CO2 mobility and therefore its risk of leakage compared to the other candidate reservoirs.",
        "53bfc4e9-fa9c-4661-880e-e557c800f047": "The foremost technical barrier to the deployment of C sequestration in coalbeds remains the swelling response of coal to CO2 sorption, having been found in several field trials to reduce the (already low) permeability of coal to the extent where CO2 injection is impractical without reservoir stimulation (e.g. van Bergen et al., 2006;Fujioka et al., 2010). Whilst coal swelling is beyond the scope of the present work, the nature of the sorption and swelling behaviour remains an active area of research (e.g. Liu et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019) and is recognised as a constraint of the CO2 storage potential of coalfields. The C sequestration potential of disturbed soils, such as spoils associated with mining, is high because the level of organic carbon they contain prior to any reclamation is much lower than in natural soils (e.g. Vinduskova & Frouz, 2013). Therefore, the difference between the starting point and the saturation level of carbon in minesoils is large. Several studies have focussed on C accumulation in restored minesoils (e.g. Akala & Lal, 2001) and have highlighted the potential of these sites for C sequestration. The sequestration of carbon in soils is dependent on good ecosystem functioning; this in turn depends on a wide range of interacting factors (Shrestha & Lal, 2006). Minesoils present a combination of problems limiting vegetation productivity and hence C sequestration. These include compaction (Bending & Moffat, 1999), poor water-holding capacity (Daniels & Zipper, 1997), nutrient deficiency (Palmer & Chadwick, 1985), low levels of soil biological activity (Anderson et al., 2008) and low pH where materials are pyritic (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1996). However, Littlefield et al. (2013) found that the rate of C accumulation in minesoils was more rapid than in natural soils where both were planted to similar forest communities.",

Thomas (1966) estimated the area in South Wales covered by colliery and ironstone spoils, often intermixed, to be approximately 5,800 ha; this area would have increased with subsequent mining activity and reprofiling of steep spoil slopes. For the purposes of this exercise, a final value of 6,500 ha is assumed. Up to the mid-1990's, much of this colliery spoil or land associated with coal mining, was reclaimed in the South Wales Coalfield (Griffiths & Smith, 2007), most planted directly into re-graded spoil. Many sites are approaching 30 years since reclamation and are likely close to maximum stocks of accumulated carbon (Vindu\u0161kov\u00e1 & Frouz, 2013). Broader studies suggest that grassland and woodland have similar soil C accumulation rates and maximum carbon stocks; woodland does have higher above-ground biomass (Patenaude et al., 2004). The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the CO2 storage potential and practicality of deep coal seams and of minesoil, using the South Wales Coalfield as a case study. A parallel study (Sarhosis et al, 2016a) generated data on coal seam sequestration potential. This work and previous studies have considered coal and minesoils as individual sinks for CO2, here we emphasise their comparison at a regional scale. Although the two approaches are complementary, their relative sequestration capacity, sequestration rates, practicalities, and cost effectiveness vary. Circumstances within individual coalfields differ, but our findings will indicate whether C sequestration associated with former coal mining activities can make a meaningful contribution to limiting atmospheric greenhouse gas increases.",

Low nitrogen availability may be a particularly important constraint in boreal forests where decomposition and mineralization rates are slow (Swift et al., 1979;Tamm, 1991). However, plant growth in boreal forests could become P limited when aluminum and iron accumulation in the humus layer is high (Giesler et al., 2002). Litter mixtures from different plant species often decompose and release N at different rates than would be predicted from rates of all component species decomposing in isolation (i.e., non-additive effects, Wardle et al., 1997;Gartner and Cardon, 2004). These nonadditive effects on litter decomposition and N dynamics often occur in mixtures containing no more than two to three species (e.g.,",

Observed k values and net N mineralization rates in the mixed plots with tamarack were significantly smaller than expected from their component species in monoculture adjusted for aboveground biomass. Antagonistic effects on soil C respiration and net N mineralization could occur because of mixing of litter with different chemistries. For instance, N-rich litter could slow down decomposition of lignin-rich litter by suppressing the formation of enzymes responsible for breaking down lignin (Carreiro et al., 2000;Saiya-Cork et al., 2002) or by reacting with lignin residues to form complexes highly resistant to microbial degradation (No \u00a8mmik and Vahtras, 1982;Stevenson, 1994;Zech and Ko \u00a8gel-Knabner, 1994). Indeed, the N concentration in aboveground tamarack litter was significantly higher than for the other two species, and release of N from this litter could potentially have reduced overall soil C respiration in mixtures with tamarack. In other studies synergistic effects have been observed in mixed-litter experiments when litter of plants with a high decomposition rate (when decomposed alone) and a high N content were present (Fyles and Fyles, 1993;Wardle et al., 1997;Salamanca et al., 1998).

These soil carbon indicators were measured in three forest types, pure P. koraiensis plantation, P. koraiensis and Betula platyphylla mixed forest, and the P. koraiensis and Quercus mongolica mixed forest. The soil carbon pool consisted of four compartments, namely L layer, F layer, H layer and B layer. With variance analysis, we found that both organic carbon content and carbon density of the soil were significantly affected by forest types, soil compartments and slope positions. The highest soil carbon density (278.63 Mg\u2022ha -1 ).was observed in the mixed forest of P. koraiensis and Q. mongolica.

It is estimated that 68-77Gt carbon are involved in respiration of soil every year (Bond et al. 2004).

Clearly, the carbon pool of the soil plays a crucial part in the global carbon circulation; hence, the carbon balance of the soil in the forest ecosystem plays an irreplaceable role in the global carbon balance (Zhou et al .2000). Therefore, the soil carbon research of the northeastern forest ecosystem is of significance for evaluating the carbon balance.

This trans-disciplinary project was conducted by agricultural and environmental researchers and overseen by a multi-stakeholder group comprised of representatives of decision-making entities in both the policy and practice domains.

The main land use and management changes implemented on the farm in 2001-2002 (Dodd et al. 2008c) included production forest plantations on steeper areas of less versatile land use capability classes (Lynn et al. 2009); protection of steams through livestock exclusion and riparian plantings (including native forest restoration); intensification of livestock enterprises through improved sheep fecundity, adoption of young cattle finishing and tactical use of nitrogen fertiliser; and soil conservation through tree planting, incl. production forestry, forest restoration and spaced-plantings.

Climate change threatens to directly damage food production and indirectly undermine the social and economic capital which supports food production (Stern 2007). Anthropogenically induced increases in atmospheric GHG concentrations are now considered responsible for global warming and associated effects on climate and weather extremes (IPCC 2014). New Zealand is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Accord and is currently developing policies to implement its commitments under the latter (MfE 2019a). While the current regulatory regime does not account for agricultural emissions at the point of origin, future policies will almost certainly include efforts to mitigate GHG emissions through changes in land use and management (PCE 2019). Several broad scale analyses have been conducted in terms of what changes might be required for farmers to comply with future obligations (e.g. Leslie et al. 2008), or to assess the financial implications for farm businesses of management changes to reduce emissions (e.g. Beukes et al. 2010;Doole 2014). However, few studies have quantified the effect of land use change on pastoral farm systems, largely because such changes have rarely been adequately documented to provide the parameterisation and/or validation data for modelling exercises. An additional complication is that existing and foreseeable GHG accounting systems do not consider all potential mitigation options at the farm scale. Specifically, there are a wide array of options for the establishment of woody vegetation on farms that represent sensible sustainable land management decisions and would represent long-term C sinks (e.g. riparian revegetation, spaced-tree planting for erosion control). However, these would not be considered valid under current formal accounting systems such as the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI, MPI 2015), due to their vegetation configuration in terms of size, shape or canopy cover.",

Any actual measurement of net GHG emissions from farm systems is extremely difficult, especially for mixed vegetation systems in hill country due to their high spatial and temporal variability. Inventory tools (e.g. Lesschen et al. 2011) are not suitable for use at farm systems scale due to the idiosyncratic features of any system in terms of land resources and management approaches. At the farm systems scale, mechanistic simulation models therefore represent the only realistic assessment approach (Rawnsley et al. 2018), though all such models must necessarily be calibrated at the component scale (e.g. individual animal emissions, tree stand growth). Some farm system models relevant to New Zealand pastoral systems have GHG assessment capabilities, such as Overseer, (Wheeler et al. 2008); the Whole Farm Model (Beukes et al. 2008); and DairyMod (Johnson et al. 2008). Such models have been used for a number of GHG assessments of New Zealand pastoral farm systems, either to examine component interventions (Beukes et al. 2010;Doole 2014), or system-level changes (White et al. 2010;Van der Weerden et al. 2018). Two key limitations of generic modelling approaches are the degree to which they account for all relevant system elements, and the paucity of farm systems datasets over sufficient periods of time to verify the assumptions in the models.

Much of the global discussion and efforts to mitigate loss and restore coastal systems has focused on marsh and nearshore environments (e.g., CPRA, 2017), but wetland forests also play an important role in the coastal zone. For example, they store and release carbon, provide critical habitat, and stabilize soils-among other high-value ecosystem services (e.g., Day et al., 2004;Dybala et al., 2018;Krauss et al., 2018). Deltaic freshwater forests can extend far inland from the coastline yet remain vulnerable to broad-scale coastal change processes, especially on the Mississippi River delta (e.g., Craig et al., 1979;Day et al., 2007;Pezeshki et al., 1990). Forested wetlands occupy a unique niche in the flooding continuum; flooding creates long periods of inhospitable conditions punctuated by periodic episodes of pro-regenerative conditions sufficient to sustain forest (Mattoon, 1915). Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich var. distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.) compete well under these conditions and form the nucleus of the cypress-tupelo swamp ecosystem that occupies many deepwater swamp regions of the delta and riparian corridors across the southeastern USA (Conner and Buford, 1998).

This is a globally significant question because of the extent of the delta and its impact on global carbon and nutrient cycling but is difficult to answer because mechanistic understanding of the relationships between tree vigor, stand density, and flooding are lacking (Allen et al., 2019;Keim et al., 2006) and time scales of response in forests are often long relative to more seaward systems. Because we lack mechanistic understanding to predict the fate of deltaic forests in the face of rapid change, robust data are needed to link patterns in forest structure and ecological services with broad-scale coastal change. Nowhere is this need greater than in the delta of the Mississippi River, where cumulative effects of hydrologic modifications to the river and its distributaries have resulted in tipping the balance between deltaic and marine processes, causing widespread land loss and ecosystem conversions (e.g., Day et al., 2000;Shaffer et al., 2009Shaffer et al., , 2016)).

Therefore, many countries are looking for alternatives that may potentially mitigate these problems, particularly by intensification in the production of renewable sources, including forest biomass (Carneiro et al., 2014). Forest biomass here is referred to as the quantity of total plant mass occurring in a forest, and it can be determined by two different approaches, destructive and non-destructive. Destructive methods (also referred to as 'direct' methods) use measurements on the plant material directly in the forest, upon harvesting. Nondestructive methods ('indirect') employ models that relate the variable 'biomass' with other variables commonly measured, e.g. during forest inventories (Sanquetta et al., 2014a). According to Schikowiski et al. (2013) the direct method of weighing all materials is, however, the most accurate approach. Studies on forest biomass have several purposes; among them is the assessment of forest growth to investigate energy production potential. Climate changerelated issues caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, particular ly carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), have also attracted interest owing to biological carbon sequestration and CO 2 fixation by forest plants (Sanquetta et al., 2014b). Currently, 8.2% of the energy produced originates from wood and charcoal, according to official sources of energy connecting area (Brasil, 2016). Biomass as a source of energy is typically used by developed countries, which employ advanced and highly efficient technologies with low emissions. In contrast, underdeveloped countries primarily rely on nonrenewable energy sources, and are thus responsible for a substantial amount of pollution, which is also because of the inefficiency of their energy generation methods. The advances achieved in Brazilian silviculture regarding the use of forest biomass for energy generation are promoted by the beneficial edaphoclimatic conditions.",
        "99e0a3c2-fb87-4ddc-ac07-de7503d2bc19": "In this context, the role of short-rotation plantations as a means of producing biomass should be emphasized, taking economic, social, and environmental dynamics into account. Decisions on silvicultural treatments and forest management aiming at the production of biomass for energy depend on the final wood processing method, the choice of suitable genetic material, planting density, and the rotation period. One of the most important aspects to be considered in the formation of forest stands for energy generation purposes is the spacing of individual plants. Plant spacing is a complex aspect from a silvicultural, technological, and economic point of view, as it affects growth rates, cutting age, wood quality, silvicultural practices, and, consequently, production costs (Caron et al., 2015). Therefore, defining the spacing for forest planting is very important, considering its influence on the growth rate and the amount and quality of raw material, and thus on production costs. Optimal spacing is therefore defined by the capability of producing the highest product amount in the desired size, shape, and quality; however, optimal spacing depends on the plant species, site characteristics, and genetic potential of the reproductive material used (Eloy et al., 2015). When targeting timber production for energy purposes, typically, dense spacing is recommended to produce the largest quantity of biomass per unit area in the shortest amount of time possible (Eloy et al., 2017a). Therefore, forestry management strives to identify species with sufficient environmental plasticity, high productivity, and superior energy-generation properties. In this context, the objective of this work was to determine the effect of age and plant spacing on biomass production capacity in four forest species, distributed in four spacings, at three different ages after planting.",

Plant surveys were carried out using 10, 40\u00d740 m 2 plots, and data were obtained by measuring tree stem girths and heights. Plant features, biomass, and stored water amounts were measured. Fresh plant samples of abundant species were taken one time per month from January to December 2018. Three soil pits were made in three plots, and soil samples along 100 cm depth were taken on the same days of collecting plant samples for studying fied capacity, water content and water amount. The DDF was divided into three stands based on the most dominant tree species; Shorea obtusa, Dipterocarpus tuberculatus, and Dipterocarpus obtusifolius. The forest was composed of 86 species with biomass at 101.62 Mg/ha and contained an average water amount of 88.01 m 3 /ha. The water amount in biomass varied with sampling times from 58.74 to 111.83 m 3 /ha. The average MWHC of 100 cm soil was estimated to be 5,113.74 m 3 /ha. The water amount in soil also varied with sampling times from 3,651.50 to 4,481.06 m 3 /ha. As a result, the total water amount in plant biomass and soil (ecosystem) of the DDF varied in a range from 3,735.0 to 4,558.67 m 3 /ha.

However, most remaining forests have suffered in part from forest concession, and illegal cutting by investors and local people. The secondary degraded forests can be observed in many areas over the country. The ecosystem function of water storage in forest biomass was different among abundant and degraded forests (Phongkhamphanh et al., 2018). Enrichment planting of selective tree species in the degraded forests is considered as an alternative method of forest restoration within a shorter period. The degraded forests have more opened canopy with big gaps, higher light intensity, fluctuating site temperature and poorer soil due to erosion as compare to the undisturbed forest. The tree species selected for enriched planting should be light demanding, fast growing, drought tolerant and have lesser nutrient requirements (Santos et al., 2020). Some enriched planting in poor natural forests has been practiced in Thailand, but very few data are published. Asanok et al. (2013) studied functional traits and the ability of tree species to reestablish in 15-year-old enriched secondary montane forest in the uplands of northern Thailand.

Chu et al. (2019) reported that enriched planting of native tree species in a 16-yearold Eucalyptus plantation in South China showed significantly reducing surface water flow, soil erosion and nutrient losses. Forest ecosystems can store water in various components after rainfall. As the rain falls into the forest, a part is intercepted by the forest canopy and later lost into the atmosphere through evaporation, and the remains pass the canopy as through fall and stem flow to the forest floor. Organic layers on the forest floor can absorb a part of water, and the remaining amounts infiltrate into mineral soil. The water is also lost from the forest floor and soil through evaporation. Some water is retained by soil organic matter, fibrous roots and particles, particularly silt and clay which are varied with multiple soil layers along soil depth (He et al., 2019), while the excess amount percolates into the underground water table and moved out into the streams. Plants usually absorb a large amount of water as well uptake nutrients from soil solution for their physiological processes and growth. The functional role of the water cycle in forest ecosystems is important to maintain all organisms including plants, animals and microbes. Forest removal in the seasonal tropical montane forest resulted in typically increasing mean annual water yield and decreasing dry-season flows (Pe\u00f1a-Arancibia et al., 2019). Noywuli et al. (2019) reported that the forest-removal upstream watershed in Indonesia had a low carrying capacity condition indicated prominently by drought. In the tropics, rainfall is only one source of water supply to watersheds and all types of ecosystem, and the forest ecosystem is considered as the most effective ecosystem in water cycle through many processes.

Most literature studies focus on inputs of precipitation into forest ecosystems and movement of water through many processes, particularly interception-evaporation by forest canopy, through fall, stem flow, plant uptake, transpiration, water flow through vegetation, evaporation from soil, infiltration into soil, drainage and runoff, stream flow, etc. However, very few data are available for the water quantity stored in the plant biomass of forests. As for the montane forest, Khamyong et al. (2014a) provided the pioneer work on water storage in plants and soils of two community montane forests of Karen tribe in northern Thailand.

A number of field measurements of forest biomass and systematic national forest inventories in Japan make it possible to quantify the C sinks and their distribution. Allometric relationships between forest biomass and stem volume were obtained for the major forest types in Japan from 945 sets of direct field measurements across the country. These relationships were used to estimate the changes in C accumulations of aboveground biomass and total living biomass from 1947 to 1995 from the national forest inventories of 1947, 1956, 1961, 1965, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990,  and 1995. The results showed that the C accumulations have significantly increased during the last 50 years. The C density (C stock per hectare) and total C stock of aboveground biomass increased from 27.6 Mg C/ha and 611.7 Tg C in 1947 to 43.2 Mg C/ha and 1027.7 Tg C in 1995, respectively, and those of total living biomass increased from 33.9 Mg C/ha and 751.8 Tg C in 1947 to 53.6 Mg C/ha and 1274.8 Tg C in 1995. These increases were remarkable during 1976-1995, with a net increase of 5.6 Mg C/ha and 369 Tg C for the C density and total living biomass. These results suggest that Japan's forest vegetation is a significant C sink. In the past 20 years, living vegetation has sequestered 18.5 Tg C annually, 14.6 Tg C of which was accumulated in aboveground biomass. The total C sink for the whole forest sector (including nonliving biomass) of Japan was estimated as 36 Tg C/yr if using the net change ratio of nonliving biomass C to living biomass C derived from the United States and Europe.",

Japan's forest is characterized by a large area of recovering forests (plantations) with different age classes, decreasing natural forests, and fast growing forests owing to an appropriate climate (enough warmth and rainfall). Therefore, identifying Japan's forest C sinks and sources can help to understand temporal and spatial changes in carbon sequestration.

Further, since 1947, and with greater attention since the 1960s, systematic forest surveys at about 5-year intervals have been conducted across the country. These direct field measurements and national statistically sound inventories provide complementary data sources for precisely estimating the changes in Japan's forest biomass C accumulation. However, this kind of study has little been reported.

This increase became more prominent after the middle of the 1970s, with a net accumulation of 18.5 Tg C/yr (14.6 Tg C/yr for aboveground biomass) (Table 5). Such a large C sink in Japan was due mainly to the contribution of plantation regrowth. In the past 20 years, plantations have accounted for $80% of the observed C sinks (11.7 versus 14.6 Tg C/yr for aboveground biomass of, and 14.8 versus 18.4 Tg C/yr for total biomass of planted forests and all forests) (Table 5). Results from the eastern United States also indicate that plantations were major contributors to the C sink [Brown and Schroeder, 1999;Caspersen et al., 2000]. Caspersen et al. [2000] suggested that the C sequestration in this region is due primarily to forest recovery from past disturbance rather than growth stimulation by a changing environment (e.g., increased atmospheric CO 2 , N deposition, or other climate changes). Japan has somewhat similar climatic conditions to that of the eastern United States; however, we cannot identify the effect of environmental changes on the growth of Japan's forests in this study. In Japan, deforestation occurred principally in natural mature forests with high biomass, perhaps indicating why the C stock accumulation in natural forests had increased negligibly or even decreased in some places.

Followed by Japan, the sink per unit area was 0.45 -0.61 Mg C/ha yr \u00c01 for the United States and 0.51 Mg C/ha yr \u00c01 for Europe. The large C sink in the United States was a result of forest regrowth [Caspersen et al., 2000], while that in Europe is due primarily to regrowth of young forests [Nabuurs et al., 2003]. A significant C sink (0.28 Mg C/ha yr \u00c01 ) in China's forests was also primarily attributed to the afforestation [Fang et al., 2001]. The small C sink (0.08 Mg C/ha yr \u00c01 ) in Russia and the negative value in Canada (\u00c00.10 Mg C/ha yr \u00c01 ) were mainly a result of increased disturbance (such as fire) [Kurz and Apps, 1999;Goodale et al., 2002].

Except for the removal of woody carbon by harvesting, information on the other three carbon pools at a national level is not available in Japan. However, ratios of carbon pools measured in the United States and Europe could be used to make a rough account of the carbon budget of Japan's forest sector, because many Japanese forests, like those of the United States and Europe, are in recovery. The ratio of net change in carbon pools of the forest sector in the United States and Europe was 0.2:0.07:0.03:0.09 for living vegetation: forest products: dead wood:soil organic carbon [Goodale et al., 2002].

Soil and tree biomass are reflected to have a large possibility for impermanent and a lot of time carbon storage (Houghton, 2005;Gower, 2003). Improvement of carbon stock by increasing the area of forested lands (afforestation) has been recommended as an efficient factor to reduce elevated CO2 agglomeration and thus provide to the prevention of global warming (Watson, 2000;IPCC, 2001). Some international organizations such as UNFCCC also encourage afforestation plans as an effective solution to decrease atmospheric carbon concentration (UNFCCC, 1997).

Several researchers (Akala and Lal, 2001;Xiao-Wen et al., 2009) have focused on the importance of afforestation and suitable species selection to enhance the carbon stocking. Thus, attention to forest ecosystem compartments contribution in carbon stocking is important, due to its necessity to recognize the potential of carbon stock of forest ecosystem to consider complex of trees, understory, soil and litter (Uri et al., 2012).

Considering 20 years of establishment of coniferous species in the degraded grassland the amount of annual Carbon stocking in the mixed P. nigra -C. libani, P. nigra, mixed P. abies -P. nigra, pure C. libani, and P. abies stands were 1.60, 1.26, 0.72, 0.67, 0.35 Mg C ha -1 y -1 , respectively. Main challenging issue was quantifying the soil and biomass carbon stock (Uri et al., 2012). The study revealed that carbon stock in the soil was higher than the other sections (85.60, 80.28, 79.58, 70.85, 58.30 and 51.11 in the P. abies, C. libani, P. abies -P. nigra, P. nigra, and P. nigra -C. libani stands, respectively. These results indicated the integral importance of soil in the carbon stocking of ecosystem. Peltoniemi et al. (2004) expressed that a significant amount of carbon was stored in the forest soils than the forest biomass. Similar results were described by Garten and Charles (2002). According to the EC / UN-ECE ( 2003), the carbon stock of forest soils in Europe was 1/5 times more than biomass. In contrast, other studies indicated the high proportion of biomass in the total ecosystem carbon stock (Uri et al., 2012;De Wit et al., 2006;Peichl and Arain, 2006). Conflicting results on the soil carbon stock could be due to the influence of various factors on this matter. It was apparent that the type of tree species affected the carbon stock by the amount and quality of organic matter input by litter, root activity and microclimate change (Jandl et al., 2007;Lugo and Brown, 1993). Also, Osher et al.",
        "10d18146-62b0-4fb4-b5f4-8c87eca5d2dd": "Also, Osher et al. (2003) expressed that the change of soil carbon stock associated with land use changes is in relation to soil mineralogy. In our study, it was found that the type of tree species had a direct impact on the carbon stock in the mineral sector of soil. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found among the clay, clay-silt, and soil carbon stock (Fig. 4a,c), while a significant negative correlation was found between the percentages of sand and soil carbon stock (Fig. 4b). Bauer et al. (1987) believed that the soil organic carbon was related to the clay of soil. Garten (2002); Powers (2002) and Schlesinger et al. (2008) confirm our findings. They found that carbon stocking correlated with the silt and clay of soil. A high percentage of sand in the spruce stand (Table 1) could be a significant factor in the low carbon stock than the other stands. Rapid carbon aggregation and turnover in the Coarsegrained soils (Richter et al., 1999) could be effective to decrease the soil carbon stock in the pure spruce stand (Fig. 2) The clay and organic carbon were often formed as aggregate, and therefore they had much more affinity to bind organic matter compared to the sand (El Tahira et al., 2009). In this regard, Borchers and Perry (1992) observed that the concentration of organic matter was less in the sandy soils than the clay and silt soils. In this study, different distributions of the soil organic carbon were determined in the soil layers of considered stands (Fig. 2). The increasing trend of carbon stock was observable in the pure pine (Fig. 2). Such a trend was seen to augment the bulk density with the increase of depth in this stand (Table 1). In general, a positive correlation between bulk density and the soil carbon stock was found in this study (Fig. 3d).",

However, the differences in the amount of sand, clay and silt in the different depths could be the reason of different carbon distribution in the soil layers. The differences among tree species in the terms of the root activity region had remarkable impacts on these differences. The root decomposition (especially thin roots) was important processes affecting the density and carbon stock (Steele, 1997). PH was one of the important soil properties which influenced the availability of the soil nutrients (Beery and Wilding, 1971) high soil pH in the surface soil layer of C. libani stand than other stands could cause to high mineral carbon stock of soil. Because there was the appropriate condition for degradation in the surface layer of this stand than the other stands which in turn increased the carbon stock in the higher levels of soil. Thuille and Schulze (2006) noted the decrease of fauna activity of acidic soil which could also result in high carbon stock in the surface layer of pinecedar stand. The litter production and its degradation had a significant effect on the soil fertility (Pragasan and Parthasaratly, 2005) and it was considered as a notable factor by which tree species could affect soil organic matter (Finzi, 1998). The high carbon stock in the biomass and litter on the forest floor in the mixed P. nigra -C. libani (Fig. 2) could significantly be due to the high significant canopy of this stand than the others. (Table 1). The litter resulted from trees were the main source of carbon in the forest ecosystems (De Marco, 2013) and the high canopy could be an integral source of litter and aboveground biomass in this stand. In total, 40.21 percent of the total carbon stock was in the aboveground P. nigra -C. libani stand. Accordingly, development of root would increase by the increase of canopy. In this stand, the highest belowground carbon stock included roots had significant difference than the other stands and it possessed 8.67 percent contribution of total carbon stocks of ecosystem.",

Conclusions: This study showed that the afforestation of degraded grasslands in the study area has a high potential of atmospheric carbon stocking and reduce the effect of high CO2 concentrations in a short time period. Biomass and soil C stocks differed depending on tree species. Further information may be worked out through the advance methodology extensive research and consideration of more factors in the future studies. Moreover, we can say that the maintenance or increase in carbon stock of forests has been linked to economic and external benefits, such as climate change mitigation, biodiversity improvement, water storage and regulation of local climate at landscape level.",

Regrettably, primary forests are decreasing at unprecedented rate due to multiple anthropogenic disturbances, therefore resulting in the secondary and planted forests as the common forest cover types around the world. The important role of secondary forest for maintaining biodiversity across the large forested landscapes cannot be denied (FAO 2010, Siminski et al. 2011). In certain cases, a secondary forest had recorded greater diversity and richness than the primary forest (Ozaki & Ohsawa 1995). Enrichment planting was introduced by Forestry Department Peninsular Malaysia to rehabilitate poorlystocked residual stands of logged over forest using selected indigenous commercial timber species. Although more than 26,000 ha of forest have been planted under the enrichment planting programme there are limited studies that report on the effectiveness of the programme in enhancing the productivity of the residual forest (Wan Yusoff & Abdul Rahman 1997). A few reports on successes of enrichment planting programme conducted within this country includes Safa et al.

(1992), about 4.45 ha of Kenaboi Forest Reserve were treated with enrichment planting, known as \"taungya system\" during the period of 1968 to 1974. The system practiced was a combination of agriculture and silviculture. The forest was used for growing agricultural crops during the initial years of the forest plantation. Before taungya was implemented in the area, the forest had undergone a few phases of disturbances, from a logged-over forest to degraded abandoned farmland and now into a rehabilitated forest reserve.",

We hypothesized that AGB stock of tree species is promoted by the simultaneous effects of restoration treatments and Technosol quality through functional trait composition. We tested the main effects of taxonomic, stand structural, functional attributes and abiotic factors undergoing different restoration methods (planting of nursery-grown seedlings, seeding, and natural regeneration) and the effect of Technosol fertilization on AGB using different linear models. The functional traits were based on the community-weighted mean of the community of values of functional traits related to MRH. Stems and biomass distribution were categorized into the following functional groups: successional strategy, dispersal syndrome, nitrogen fixation, wood density (WD). As expected, during early restoration stage, the pioneer and anemochoric species were dominants mainly represented by naturally regenerated stems. However, the autochoric dispersal and nitrogen-fixing tree species were biomass dominant groups in active restoration, driven mostly by Senna alata which had high abundance and WD. We found that high WD and active restoration methods determine higher AGB stock on mining tailings where natural regeneration is limited. We conclude that functional composition reverses the effects of species richness and abundance on AGB tenting the MRH. Therefore, the effects of functional composition and restoration methods are key predictors on ecosystem functioning during forest restoration.",

The deposition of tailings on secondary Atlantic forest along these rivers and their tributaries was restricted to a 113 km area from the Fund\u00e3o dam to the Risoleta Neves hydroelectric plant, called Environmental Area 1 (Martins et al. 2020a). The ecological restoration activities on these affected areas combining different methods and techniques of active and passive restoration are being applied to recovery plant diversity and ecosystem services, such as aboveground biomass (AGB) stock (Campanharo et al. 2020(Campanharo et al. , 2021;;Martins et al. 2020aMartins et al. , 2020b)). These methods are typically used in contrasting context-dependent conditions, for example, passive restoration is usually successful where the vegetation spontaneously recovers by natural regeneration (Holl & Aide 2011;Holl 2017), meanwhile active restoration is recommended in degraded areas where natural regeneration is hindered or limited (Holl 2012;Martins 2018;Campanharo et al. 2020). However, to know the efficiency of the methods in the affected areas in Mariana is still a priority need. For example, early restoration stages can expect higher plant diversity and AGB stock for planting of nursery-grown seedlings compared with non-planted species in highly degraded areas (Wheeler et al. 2016;Campanharo et al. 2020). Thus, monitoring ecological indicators (i.e. plant community diversity, composition, structure, and functions) of rapid assessment and direct positive effects on Atlantic forest ecosystem functioning contributes to a better understanding of restoration practices and guides further activities and projects (Campanharo et al. 2020(Campanharo et al. , 2021;;Martins et al. 2020aMartins et al. , 2020b)).",

Recently, substantial advance has been made to understand the species relative contribution to the ecosystem functioning on the functional trait-based approach (e.g. Gross et al. 2017;Poorter et al. 2017;Zirbel et al. 2017). Thus, this approach has great importance to explain the effects of multiple anthropogenic, abiotic, and abiotic factors (i.e. taxonomic identity and functional diversity) on multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) at multiple spatial and temporal scales (Gross et al. 2017;van der Plas 2019;Sanaei et al. 2020). Biotic factors have greater importance on ecosystem functioning mainly on a fine spatial scale and anthropogenic factors related to land-use changes at the local and regional scale (e.g. Zirbel et al. 2017;van der Plas 2019;Villa et al. 2021). Conversely, abiotic factors (i.e. climate, soil, and topography) can be the main driver of plant community assembly and ecosystem processes on multiple spatial scales (e.g. Conti & D\u00edaz 2013; van der Plas 2019; Villa et al. 2021;Wang & Ali 2021). Thus, it is possible to predict the functional consequences of biodiversity loss based on the functional trait distribution that operates on a biome scale and that quantifies the maxima of trait diversity that are needed to maintain multifunctionality in terrestrial ecosystems (Gross et al. 2017). Furthermore, this trait-based approach to evaluate plant community assembly mechanisms that achieve functional targets for ecological restoration at local scale is a current trend of high relevance (Laughlin 2014;Zirbel et al. 2017;Carlucci et al. 2020). For instance, tree species with higher WD might be selected and prioritized to provide the restored community with resistance to future dry conditions (Laughlin 2014;Poorter et al. 2019).",
        "ecf4d9d4-dfcf-49e6-b0b4-abbea4a1d670": "2019). Tropical dry forest trait changes can be partially explained by water limitations in early succession; meanwhile in wet forest the community functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative traits (i.e. specific leaf area, WD), suggesting decreasing light availability to be the main driver (Lohbeck et al. 2013;Poorter et al. 2019). This approach can help to select key species that optimize the provision of multiple ecosystem services in a resilient restored ecosystem (Carlucci et al. 2020). In tropical forest, the anthropogenic, abiotic factors, and stand age attributes (i.e. functional, taxonomic, and structural attributes) concomitantly shape ecosystem functioning, such as AGB stock (Ali et al. 2017;Poorter et al. 2017;Villa et al. 2020a). Thus linking the functional diversity (i.e. traitbased approach), taxonomical diversity (i.e. tree species richness and community composition), stand structural attributes (i.e. WD and height), and AGB stock, it is possible to understand and improve forest management and conservation (Poorter et al. 2016;Villa et al. 2020a). Furthermore, the aboveground carbon stock recovery and conservation is an important ecosystem service to climate change mitigation (Villa et al. 2020b). Recently, these changes during ecological restoration and ecosystem recovery have been evaluated in different studies under the trait-based approach of plant communities (functional traits associated with colonization, establishment, growth, and survival) in different types of tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests (Poorter et al. 2017(Poorter et al. , 2019;;Yuan et al. 2019;Hao et al. 2020;Mensah et al. 2020;Sanaei et al. 2020;Villa et al. 2020a;Wang & Ali 2021). Furthermore, this approach has relevance in different types of ecosystems, such as alpine grasslands (W\u00fcest et al.",
        "32df1b48-1584-4557-a676-395a384724cb": "2018), sandy grassland (Zuo et al. 2016), and prairies (Zirbel et al. 2017). In this context, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) in tropical forests (Chisholm et al. 2013;Poorter et al. 2017). The BEF relationship is important for the understanding of how taxonomical and functional species diversity of tree communities affects the AGB stock and dynamic (e.g. Poorter et al. 2017;Hao et al. 2020;Mensah et al. 2020;Villa et al. 2020b), including in areas undergoing secondary succession in human-modified forest landscapes (Lohbeck et al. 2015;Villa et al. 2020bVilla et al. , 2021)). Previous studies show that in tropical forests the dominant species (i.e. higher basal area or WD) are the most representative in ecosystem processes (e.g. Bastin et al. 2015;Fauset et al. 2015;Ali et al. 2019;Rodrigues et al. 2019). The dominant species have hard functional traits, which contribute most to ecosystem function (Grime 1998). This phenomenon of a disproportionate influence of a small number of dominant tree species on ecosystem functioning is also called \"hyperdominance\" (e.g. Bastin et al. 2015;Fauset et al. 2015;Rodrigues et al. 2019) and has been applied to describe the relative contribution to ecosystem services, such as biomass and carbon storage at regional and fine scales in natural forests (Fauset et al. 2015;Rodrigues et al. 2019). Thus, one competing ecological hypothesis, the mass ratio hypothesis (MRH), has been proposed to test that ecosystem functioning is driven by functional traits of the most dominant species in communities (Grime 1998).",
        "7d897a75-eda0-4ccc-ba7f-0c02ea40eac2": "There is substantial evidence to support this hypothesis based on the communityweighted trait mean (CWM) to explain AGB (Ali et al. 2017;Villa et al. 2020a). These researches have demonstrated that under MRH the CWM of different trait values of a few dominant species determines AGB in secondary forests (Lohbeck et al. 2015(Lohbeck et al. , 2016;;Ali et al. 2017;Poorter et al. 2017;Villa et al. 2020b). For example, the dominant species are abundant or present some hard functional trait (i.e. tree height and WD), which contribute most to increase AGB in tropical forests (Ali et al. 2019;Rodrigues et al. 2019;Villa et al. 2020b). Thus, functional composition can be a predictor of AGB stock variability in secondary forests succession, along with abiotic factors (i.e. soil fertility and texture properties variability) and stand structural attributes (Poorter et al. 2017(Poorter et al. , 2019;;Villa et al. 2020b). In this sense, soil fertility can shape nutrient resource availability (Paoli et al. 2005), and this availability triggers faster plant growth (Russo et al. 2005;Quesada et al. 2012). Most of these studies in tropical forests that analyze the effects of multiple abiotic (i.e. soil properties, climate) and anthropogenic factors (i.e. disturbance by land-use changes) and dimensions of tree species diversity (i.e. species richness and composition, and functional diversity) on ecosystem functioning have been in secondary forests compared with reference old-growth forests (Lohbeck et al. 2013;Matos et al. 2020;Villa et al. 2020aVilla et al. , 2021;;Jakovac et al. 2021). However, little is known about the ecosystem functioning distribution (i.e.",
        "f7de6894-d28e-4857-8b87-c804754699f4": "2021). However, little is known about the ecosystem functioning distribution (i.e. AGB stock) between tree dominant species and functional groups (i.e. such as seed dispersal syndrome and regeneration strategies) during active restoration in human-modified tropical forest landscapes. Thus, there is strong evidence that during the early stages of tropical forest succession after anthropogenic disturbance by land-use change, light-demanding pioneer species dominate (Villa et al. 2018(Villa et al. , 2019) ) along with non-zoochoric pioneer species (Tabarelli & Peres 2002). The land-use history can determine changes in tree diversity and carbon stock along tropical forest (Jakovac et al. 2021), as well as the changes in the relative importance of tree species and functional groups (i.e. fruit dispersal syndrome and regeneration strategies) on the carbon storage distribution during succession (Santo-Silva et al. 2016;Matos et al. 2020;Villa et al. 2020a). However, studies on the simultaneous effects of abiotic factors, species richness, stem density and tree size, and functional trait composition and functional groups on AGB undergoing tropical forest restoration are still needed. In this context, this research aimed to test the main effects of abiotic factors (i.e. Technosol fertility), stand structural (i.e. stem count), taxonomic (i.e. tree species richness), and functional attributes (functional composition of WD and height) undergoing different restoration methods (i.e. planting of nursery-grown seedlings, direct seeding, and natural regeneration) on AGB in areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam collapse in Mariana, Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we evaluate the AGB distribution pattern among functional groups by restoration treatment. We estimate the biomass distribution by functional groups of tree species, such as successional strategy, dispersal syndrome, nitrogen fixation, WD categories, and restoration strategy. Thus, we respond to the following research questions: (1) What are the tree species richness and composition patterns by functional groups and restoration treatments?",

(4) What is the relative importance of distribution of abiotic factors (Technosol fertility), stand tree attributes (taxonomic, structural, and functional), and restoration methods on AGB? We hypothesized that the restoration methods and functional trait composition reverse the relative impact of taxonomic and stand structural attributes on AGB stock. Thus, we expect that functional traits explain the higher variation of AGB in conditions of active restoration with fertilization, while these degraded areas with tailings accumulation may reduce the importance of natural regeneration with a decrease in AGB stock.",
        "63a3da22-e80d-46ac-8ba9-5d67da526e96": "The results demonstrate the relationships among Technosol fertility, biotic attributes, such as species richness, stem count, and functional composition with AGB of tree species undergoing different restoration methods in the Atlantic forests. The functional composition of WD and active restoration methods had relevance to predict AGB along restoration, because AGB increased with CWM of WD and SDf and PSf treatments based on the best models tested. These results showed that the high AGB in restored forests can be better explained by the MRH (based on WD) than by the species richness and abundance. A recent meta-analysis indicates that a positive link between CWM of plant maximum height or diameter and AGB is conspicuous across forest ecosystems along a global latitudinal gradient, hence providing support to the mass ratio effect in terms of functional dominance in forest ecosystems (Wang & Ali 2021). Finally, our results demonstrated how the functional trait composition of the Atlantic forest undergoing active restoration plays an important role in ecosystem functioning recovery. However, although functional composition, structural attributes, and abiotic factors have been reported to underlie tree species diversity and AGC patterns in both temperate and tropical secondary forests (Ali et al. 2019;Hao et al. 2020;Mensah et al. 2020;Wang & Ali 2021), their relative importance may vary with forest type, stand age, and climatic conditions at various spatial scales (van der Plas 2019; Hao et al. 2020).",

To reverse this process, rehabilitating degraded lands, restoration plantations with native tree species show significant potential to rebuild the forest habitat and promoting carbon sequestration. High input silviculture (intensive fertilization and weed control), similar to those applied in commercial production forest plantations can increase productivity, accelerating forest restoration process. We evaluated the effects of two contrasting silvicultural systems, ''traditional'' (based on common silviculture of forest reforestation in Brazil -low input) and ''intensive'' (based on commercial plantations -high input) on carbon (C) stocks of a restoration plantation.

The biome is considered a hot-spot for plant species richness and endemism, supporting over 20,000 species of vascular plants (Myers et al., 2000). Due to deforestation for urbanization and agriculture expansion, the biome has been reduced to less than 12% of its original cover, with remnant patches highly fragmented across the region (Ribeiro et al., 2009). To overcome this situation, forest restoration has a significant potential and has been successfully used (Chazdon, 2008;Ciccarese et al., 2012). Some methodologies of forest restoration use the natural resilience of the degraded ecosystem with minimum human interference in the process (Holl et al., 2003;Rodrigues et al., 2009). Others speed recovery by planting native tree species (Lamb et al., 2005). Forest restoration plantations on degraded areas can provide several benefits, such as soil and water conservation, biodiversity habitat and carbon sequestration (Benayas et al., 2009;Campoe et al., 2010;Kanowski and Catterall, 2010). Severely disturbed sites with depleted soils and no seed bank or nearby sources of seeds may benefit from the inputs of forest restoration plantations to catalyze forest regeneration (Parrotta et al., 1997). Restoration plantations on degraded sites typically receive low-input silviculture, with little or no soil preparation, nutrient application and weed control. Weed control may be particularly important, as native tree species suffer severe competition from non-native invasive C4 grasses (Eyles et al., 2012).

The herbaceous vegetation before the plantation was established represented approximately 30% of the carbon stock that accumulated in 6 years with traditional silviculture, contrasting with approximately 1% under intensive silviculture (Table 2).

Additionally, 80% of the remnants are highly fragmented, with less than 50 hectares and with an average distance of approximately 1500 m from each other (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Therefore, the combination of intensive fertilization and chemical weed control is crucial to the survival and growth of planted trees aiming at restoration. The low effectiveness of limited mechanical weed control and low levels of available nutrients of the traditional treatment allowed substantial understory competition, retarding growth and C accumulation by the planted trees. During establishment and early stages, the root system of new planted seedlings and weeds explore the same soil layers. Due to the C4 photosynthetic cycle characteristic of the dominant grass on our experimental site, the competition for resources (water and nutrients) is unbalanced. Therefore, effective weed control is mandatory to increase carbon sequestration on planted trees (Fig. 4). In the same site, Campoe et al. (2010Campoe et al. ( , 2014) ) found that growth was highly responsive to the weed control, with the planted tree species showing $20% higher photosynthesis with intensive silviculture.",

Early weed control on Eucalyptus plantation (until 18 months) allowed the trees to increase investment in leaf area growth, increasing productivity (Eyles et al., 2012). Extra fertilization is equally important, especially under conditions of tropical depleted abandoned pasture lands (Furtini Neto et al., 2004). The successional status of the tree species result in a wide range of nutrient demand, however all tree species respond positively to the increase in nutrient availability (Santos Jr. et al., 2006). Davidson et al. (2004) studying tree biomass growth in a secondary forest in Brazil observed that all species showed higher productivity after the application of nitrogen and phosphorus, otherwise limited by lack of nutrient. Scarce information related to native tree species demand for nutrients limits precise fertilization recommendation, leading foresters to rely on fertilization rates of forest plantations for wood production. Substantial studies focusing on Brazilian tree species demand for nutrients are needed. Two years after planting, canopy closure of the intensive treatment provided enough shading to inhibit weed growth; therefore, broadcasted chemical weed control was replaced by limited spotted application of herbicide, allowing natural regeneration of native tree species from the planted species and from surrounding remnants. Evaluation of natural regeneration had been performed at our experimental site, showing significant saplings recruitment of both planted and not planted tree species growing and forming an understory, with significantly higher recruitment on intensive management (data not shown). Carbon stock and sequestration on mineral soil was constant in space (for both silvicultural systems) and time (between planting time and after 6 years, Fig. 4). These results were similar to several forest or grassland systems, showing that despite a significant stock, soil C sequestration was uncertain to be accounted as a carbon sink of a forest plantation (Post and Kwon, 2000).  As observed in our results (Table 2, Fig.",
        "6eec9218-28c7-4cdd-a151-4262f15e8905": "As observed in our results (Table 2, Fig. 4), forest restoration plantations on tropical regions have actual potential to be a carbon sequestration mechanism on both above-and belowground for long periods of time (Silver et al., 2001). Restoration of forest plantations with multiple tree species (20 for this study), from different succession classes may show double benefits in terms of carbon sequestration. Early-succession fast-growing species (pioneers) are able to capture carbon fast, and late-succession long-lived species (non-pioneers) maintain the carbon fixed in the forest system for long periods of time (Redondo-Brenes and Montagnini, 2006). Especially under conditions of degraded abandoned pasture lands, dominated by C4 grasses, fast initial development of pioneer species are crucial to reach canopy closure as soon as possible to prevent establishment of competing vegetation. Intensive silviculture, especially during the early stages of a forest plantation, provide nutrients and absence of weed competition, changing physical and biological site conditions, facilitating the forest restoration process (Lugo, 1997;Parrotta et al., 1997). The intensive silviculture increased growth and carbon sequestration, resulting in a carbon stock closer to the one of the native mature forest, comparing with traditional silviculture. Forest plantations aiming at restoration and also carbon sequestration are feasible, and highly responsive to intensive silviculture to achieve high rates of carbon stocks.",

Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have",

These forests are significant sinks of atmospheric carbon since stock several times more carbon than the amount found in other terrestrial forests. Indeed, mangroves account for around 3% of carbon sequestering by tropical forests, although they only represent around 1% of them, so contributing significantly in counteract global warming (Donato et al. 2011;Alongi 2014;Bhomia et al. 2016). Climate change and land-use disturbance can reduce goods and services of tropical mangroves in the next decades (Valiela et al. 2001;Alongi 2002;Twilley 2008). Changes in estuary hydrology and nutrient levels reflect in mangrove growth in terms of biomass, which represents carbon sequestered from the atmosphere. Mangroves are good indicators of these impacts, and as transitional sea-land forests can migrate inland and upper littoral in response to salinity intrusion from ocean level rise, and also from damming and water flux changes (Lacerda and Marins 2002;Lacerda et al. 2007). Aboveground forest biomass is used to assess growth, productivity and potential for the atmospheric carbon intake of mangroves (Ross et al. 2001;Juman 2005;Fonseca 2005; Soares and Schaeffer-Novelli 2005; Medeiros and Sampaio 2008;Camacho et al. 2011;Estrada et al. 2015). The accurate quantification of carbon stock is necessary not only as a baseline for improve knowledge on mangrove nutrient cycles, but also for their inclusion in national and international programs of climate change mitigation (i.e. Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, REDD?) (Murdiyarso et al. 2012;Kauffman et al. 2014).",

This is result of different tree composition, variations in climate (temperature, rainfall) and geomorphic settings, soils and tides (Krauss et al. 2014;Alongi 2014;Bhomia et al. 2016), and also due to biotic factors like competition for light, tree structure, herbivory, and also macrobenthic diversity (Warren and Underwood 1986;Lee 1999;Cannicci et al. 2008;Ferreira et al. 2013). Macrobenthic community structure, i.e. species richness and diversity, influences forest ecological processes (Morrisey et al. 1999, Chapman andTolhurst 2004;Smith et al. 1991;Kristensen and Alongi 2006). Brachyuran crabs from the superfamilies Ocypodoidea and Grapsoidea (Brachyura: Decapoda) (Ng et al. 2008), are extremely abundant in mangroves, and are 'ecosystem engineers' which play a significant role in topography and biogeochemistry of the sediment, and in plant diversity, structure and biomass (Warren and Underwood 1986;Robertson and Daniel 1989;Kristensen and Kostka 2005;Kristensen 2008). Brachyurans can influence type and structure of the mangrove forest by herbivory, such as consumption of specific propagule types (Smith et al. 1989;McKee 1995a;McGuiness 1997b;Sousa and Mitchell 1999;Bosire et al. 2005;Van Nedervelde et al. 2015).",

In East Africa, herbivorous crabs like Sesarmids (Grapsoidea) consume more Ceriops tagal and Bruguiera gymnorhiza propagules than Rhizophora mucronata (Bosire et al. 2004(Bosire et al. , 2005)). In Neotropics, ecologically similar Grapsoids prefer to feed on propagules of Avicennia schaueriana and Laguncularia racemosa over Rhizophora mangle, oppositely to Ocypodoid Ucides cordatus (Smith et al. 1989;Delgado et al. 2001;Nordhaus 2003;Ferreira et al. 2013). On the other hand, large burrows and high crab populations can influence mangrove soils by burrowing activity and consequent sediment turnover (Warren and Underwood 1986). Some mangrove propagules like Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Avicennia officinalis, A. germinans, A. schaueriana and L. racemosa, can be affected by sediment burial (Terrados et al. 1997;Delgado et al. 2001;Thampanya et al. 2002;Ferreira et al. 2013). Smaller propagules like Neotropical L. racemosa and A. germinans cannot resist 2-3 cm of permanent burial (Delgado et al. 2001), so can be more affected by sediment extracted from crab burrowing. Considering different tree species stock different amounts of carbon (Ray et al. 2011;Rodrigues et al. 2014;Ferreira et al. 2015), herbivory and bioturbation behaviors of crabs could influence biomass stock at trees, and rates of atmospheric carbon intake of the forest could be in part a function of brachyuran assemblage composition and their effect on seedling recruitment aboveground.",

The ecological restoration is a powerful tool for reconstructing degraded mangroves worldwide (Hong, 1996;Macintosh et al. 2002;SER 2004;Ferreira et al. 2007;Lewis 2005Lewis , 2009)). It can minimize greenhouse effect promoted by mangrove clearing (Alongi 2014;Bhomia et al. 2016). However, despite countless mangrove areas reforested worldwide, there are still few long-term data, in particular at Neotropics, on changes in tree biomass after disturbances, as well as on the relation of these changes with key faunal groups diversity and their life habits (Zimmer 2018;see Ferreira et al. 2015). These data are fundamental for the design of more specific and ecologically functional restoration measures. In a long term reforestation program of a mangrove stand in northeastern Brazil, two deforested areas were managed and compared since 2006; one planted with R. mangle and the other left to recuperate by itself. Through periodic surveys, we assessed the influence of management (tree species, planted density) and brachyuran assemblage (species occurrence and number of individuals) on forest development and biomass stock in the areas. In this work, the aim was to (1) assess the aboveground standing biomass and carbon stocking of the different managed forest fragments in ten years and discuss the effectiveness of management measures applied since the intervention, and; (2) assess the effects of management factors and fossorial brachyuran crabs on aboveground carbon storage in a restored forest.",

However, credible information about its growth in terms of biomass and its capacity to capture and store CO 2 is still insufficient in order to suggest ways by which forest owners should be compensated. The objective for this study was to construct models that allow us to determine tree biomass for native tree plantations of Hieronyma alchorneoides Allem\u00e0o, Vochysia guatemalensis Donn and a group of 35 species of secondary forests in the Costa Rican Caribbean region. In each plantation the tree with the mean diameter at breast height (d) was harvested; in secondary forests the harvested tree corresponded to the mean d tree with the highest Importance Value Index (IVI) for each diametric class. Destructive sampling was used, separating each tree component and collecting a field sample in order to determine dry matter content (MS). All selected models had R 2 aj values above 82.6%. Tree species from secondary forests showed the lowest R 2 aj values. Stem, roots and total biomass had R 2 aj values above 91.3%, while leaves and branches had values between 82.6 and 94.1%. Biomass expansion factor (BEF) in secondary forest was 1.44 and in forest tree plantations it was 1.56.

Twenty six months after forest stand installation, samples of herbaceous vegetation (0.49 m 2 quadrat), forest species (8 PM and 8 CS) and mineral soil (at 0-5, 5-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm depth) were collected in 15 randomly selected points in each treatment, processed in laboratory and analyzed for carbon by elemental carbon analyzer.Main results: The results obtained showed that: (i) more than 90% of the total carbon stored in the system is located in the soil, increasing in depth with tillage intensity; (ii) the contribution of herbaceous vegetation and related roots to the carbon storage is very low; (iii) the amount of carbon per tree is higher in CS than in PM; (iv) the global carbon storage was affected by soil tillage generally decreasing with the increase of tillage intensity.

These effects are especially important in the Mediterranean region, where water shortage is the main factor limiting the success of afforestation (Daget, 1977;Ojasvi et al., 1999;Kanegae et al., 2000;Silva, 2002;Fonseca et al., 2011). The correct installation of forest stands, which results in better productivity and lower impacts on soil and environment has also to consider the growing concern with effects on global warming and climate change (Birdsey et al., 1993). In this context, it is essential to select appropriate site preparation techniques for new plantations, in order to satisfy an increasingly current requirement in sustainable resources management (Worrell and Hampson, 1997;Zheng et al., 2008). Caspersen et al. (2000) showed that land-use change is the main factor governing the rate of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems in the USA. Following afforestation, changes inevitably happen in the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of soil carbon. Mechanical disturbance lead to increased organic matter decomposition, because it breaks up organomineral aggregates and exposes to decomposers (Turner and Lambert, 2000;Balesdent et al., 2000;Madeira et al., 2002;Schulp et al., 2008;Zheng et al., 2008), which is site-specific and varies with system's disturbance intensity (Post and Kwon, 2000;Fonseca, 2005). There is a wide variation in the time period and the rate at which carbon may accumulate in soil, depending on site preparation, plant productivity, soil characteristics, past history of carbon gains, climate, and site management (Post and Kwon, 2000;Paul et al., 2002). Probably, all of the forests in Mediterranean region have been transformed by humans to some degree at some time in the past.",

This knowledge may help guiding the choice of soil preparation techniques for sustainable systems establishment, specifically those aimed at carbon accumulation. Forest trees and forest soils have both a huge capacity to accumulation and release carbon (Dixon et al., 1994;Mendham et al., 2003;Jacobs et al., 2009). Forest trees contribute differently to carbon storage in forest ecosystems depending on the state of stand development (age) and on forest species sylvicultural characteristics (Silver et al., 2000;Turner and Lambert, 2000). Soil carbon is a very significant compartment of total carbon storage in forest ecosystems, but has received less attention than carbon in tree biomass (Johnson, 1992;Harrison et al., 1995;Turner and Lambert, 2000). The present study aims to evaluate carbon storage and distribution on a mixed forest stands recently established under different site preparation techniques. Total carbon inventories in system include carbon stored in forest species, herbaceous vegetation and mineral soil.",

To assess how long the synergistic effects of acacias on eucalypts in mixed stands would last, and what future trajectory growth might take, we investigated the growth dynamics of mixed and mono-specific plantations over the first 11 years since establishment.Monocultures of E. globulus (E) and A. mearnsii (A) and mixtures (75E:25A, 50E:50A, 25E:75A) of these species were planted following a species replacement series. At the tree level, eucalypt and acacia heights, diameters, volumes and aboveground biomass were higher in mixtures than in monocultures 3-4 years after planting. Similarly, at the stand level, volumes and above-ground biomass were significantly greater in mixtures than monocultures after 3-4 years. The difference in productivity between mixed plots and mono-specific eucalypt stands increased with time from 3 to 11 years after establishment. Litterfall was higher in the mixed stands than the monocultures, and this led to an increase in N and P cycling through litterfall in stands containing A. mearnsii.The study indicated that above-ground biomass accumulation in E. globulus plantations can be increased by acacia admixture. This can partially be explained by canopy stratification and improved nutrition of eucalypts. Although the biomass production in acacias peaked early, the synergistic effect of the acacias appears to be long lasting as was indicated by the increasing differences between mixed and pure stands.",

Competition occurs when two or more plants or populations interact so that at least one exerts a negative effect on the other (growth or mortality) (Vandermeer, 1989). Competitive reduction in a mixture, also known as complementarity or the competitive production principle, occurs when the interspecific competition for a limiting resource is less than that in the monocultures (Kelty and Cameron, 1995). This often occurs when there is a partitioning of either above-ground (light) or below-ground resources (water or nutrients) (Kelty and Cameron, 1995) that leads to niche separation and ultimately a more efficient use of site resources. Facilitation occurs when one species has a positive effect on another (Vandermeer, 1989), for example, when a nitrogen-fixing species increases the growth of the other by increasing nitrogen (N) availability. When positive interactions are dominant (facilitation or competitive reduction), mixed stands should be more productive than monocultures. However, if the inter-specific competition is greater than these positive interactions, mixtures will be less productive. It is difficult to forecast the outcome of the various interactions in mixed stands, and the nature of these interactions may change as the stands develop. This makes predictions of potentially successful species combinations, optimal proportions and suitable sites for the combinations difficult until a rotation has been completed. Few studies have examined the growth dynamics of mixed-species plantations of Eucalyptus with a N-fixing species and these have been in the tropics (DeBell et al., 1997;Parrotta, 1999;Wichiennopparat et al., 1998).

This is largely in response to economic, social and environmental drivers such as increasing demand for wood, favourable wood properties and growth rates, so as to reduce pressure on harvesting of native forests and to sequester carbon. However, the potentially high water use by Eucalyptus plantations can cause conflict, and raises concerns about local and regional water supply when these processes are not properly understood (Morris et al., 2004;Whitehead and Beadle, 2004). Developing optimum management techniques and understanding the role of plantations in local and global water and carbon cycling requires a good understanding of the effects of climate and management on the growth and water use of these plantations (Hubbard et al., 2004). The focus of forest productivity is often on total biomass or its harvestable component. The calculation of WUE in alternative silvicultural strategies can illustrate how efficient the production process has been and what scope remains for improvement. Mixed-species plantations containing Eucalyptus sp. (non-nitrogen (N 2 )-fixing) and N 2 -fixing species (such as Acacias sp.) are a potentially valuable management technique for increasing productivity while lowering N fertiliser costs. The total productivity of mixed-species is often higher than Eucalyptus monocultures due to Significant increases in aboveground biomass production have been observed when Eucalyptus is planted with a nitrogen-fixing species due to increased nutrient availability and more efficient use of light. Eucalyptus and Acacia are among the most popular globally planted genera with the area of Eucalyptus plantations alone expanding to over 19 Mha over the past two decades. Despite this, little is known about how nutrition and light availability in mixed-species tree plantations influence water use and water use efficiency (WUE).",
        "cca8d8ef-736e-4ebf-b8a8-fa4c7e90c6c6": "This study examined to what extent water use and WUE have been influenced by increased resource availability and growth in mixed-species plantations. Monocultures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman and 1:1 mixtures of these species were planted. Growth and transpiration were measured between ages 14 and 15 years. Aboveground biomass increment (Mg ha \u00c01 ) was significantly higher in mixtures (E. globulus; 4.8 + A. mearnsii; 0.9) than E. globulus (3.3) or A. mearnsii monocultures (1.6). Annual transpiration (mm) measured using the heat pulse technique was also higher in mixtures (E. globulus; 285 + A. mearnsii; 134) than in E. globulus (358) and A. mearnsii (217) monocultures. Mixtures exhibited higher WUE than monocultures due to significant increases in the WUE of E. globulus in mixtures (1.69 kg aboveground biomass per cubic metre water transpired) compared to monocultures (0.94). The differences in WUE appear to result from increases in canopy photosynthetic capacity and above-to belowground carbon allocation in mixtures compared to monocultures. Although further studies are required and operational issues need to be resolved, the results of this study suggest that mixed eucalypt-acacia plantations may be used in waterlimited environments to produce a given amount of wood with less water than eucalypt monocultures. Alternatively, because mixtures can be more productive and use more water per unit land area (but use it more efficiently), they could be utilized in recharge zones where rising water tables and salinity result from the replacement of vegetation (fast growing trees) that uses higher quantities of water with vegetation (shallow rooted annual crops) that use lower quantities of water. \u00df 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, this enhanced productivity is likely associated with increased water use and it is unclear whether this is proportional to the productivity increases or whether there are changes in water use efficiency (WUE). Improved WUE would enable the production of more wood per litre of water transpired. An ability to make the most efficient use of resources (water and nutrients) is highly desirable due to the global demand of other water users and the economic and environmental expense (in terms of CO 2 or non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions) in producing and applying fertiliser. Water use efficiency can be increased when different species have contrasting water uptake strategies. This is because they may obtain water from different parts of the soil profile due to a stratification of roots, thereby increasing water uptake and total biomass production with the same annual precipitation. This is often referred to as niche separation and competitive reduction (Vandermeer, 1989;Kelty, 1992;Jose et al., 2006). Few studies have linked differences in fine root distribution to higher productivity either due to reductions in inter-specific competition or increased use of resources (Jose et al., 2006). Nevertheless, competition may be reduced by temporal differences in water uptake, such as when deciduous trees are growing with evergreen trees (Kelty, 1992;Catovsky et al., 2002;Legare et al., 2005). Changes in WUE can also occur if species interactions lead to changes in WUE in terms of wood or carbon gain per unit water transpired. For example, increased N and P availability can increase instantaneous leaf-level WUE due to increased photosynthetic capacity without proportional increases in stomatal conductance or transpiration (Sheriff et al., 1986;Green and Mitchell, 1992;Hobbie and Colpaert, 2004).",

However, there are also examples of no changes in WUE or growth efficiency (biomass increment per unit leaf area) after monospecific plantations have been fertilised, at both the leaf (Pereira et al., 1992) and stand levels (Hubbard et al., 2004;du Toit and Dovey, 2005).

It was conducted in a 14-year old trial in which mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mearnsii had previously been shown to produce twice as much aboveground biomass as Eucalyptus monocultures (Forrester et al., 2005b). Low soil fertility, especially phosphorus and nitrogen, is considered to be the major growth limiting factor at this site, including during the study period. In addition, whilst the long-term annual precipitation at this site is 1009 mm, the annual precipitation during the study year was only 730 mm. Several processes and interactions have already been measured in this trial including N 2fixation (Forrester et al., 2007), nutrient cycling (Forrester et al., 2005a), growth dynamics (Forrester et al., 2004), carbon allocation (Forrester et al., 2006a), light capture (Bauhus et al., 2004), fine root distribution and fine root architecture (Khanna, 1997;Bauhus et al., 2000).

Four replicated sites afforested with different tree species (spruce, pine, larch, oak, lime or alder) were compared with sites left to natural regeneration which were dominated by aspen, birch and willow. No topsoil was applied at the sites; hence carbon accumulation resulted from in situ soil development on alkaline tertiary clays that were dumped on the heaps. In aboveground tree biomass, carbon storage ranged from 17.0 \u00b1 5.9 (mean \u00b1 SEM) to 67.6 \u00b1 5.9 t ha -1 and the rate of C accumulation increased from 0.60 \u00b1 0.09 to 2.31 \u00b1 0.23 t ha -1year -1 (natural regeneration \\ pine \\ spruce \\ oak \\ lime \\ alder \\ larch).

No significant correlation was found between C storage in soil and aboveground litter input. Total soil carbon storage was correlated positively and significantly with earthworm density, and occurrence of earthworm cast in topsoil, which indicated that bioturbation could play an important role in soil carbon storage.

        "db2027aa-0738-434d-bc48-7102c7f4da8d": "Carbon sequestration by changing land use has the potential to mitigate the increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Afforestation or reforestation of marginal areas are among some promising means of C sequestration. For this reason much research has focused on C sequestration in tree biomass (Niu and Duiker 2006), although afforestation may also increase soil C storage. The amount of C stored in soil depends largely on the tree species and soil conditions (Cannel and Dewar 1995;Ladegaard-Pedersen et al. 2005). Therefore, soil C storage in reforested areas is also highly variable (Akala and Lal 2000;Garten 2002;Peichl et al. 2006). Post-mining sites are areas with a large potential for C storage (Schafer et al. 1979;Akala and Lal 2000;Skukla and Lal 2005;Ussiri et al. 2006). Beside the global impact of C storage, soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation may improve many important functions of post-mining soils. SOM is a source of energy for soil microorganisms, affects sorption capacity and the water holding capacity of soil, and supports the formation of soil aggregates and soil structure. (Allison 1973;Insam and Domsch 1988;Stewart andScullion 1988, 1989;Frouz et al. 2006). Thus SOM accumulation plays an important role in ecosystem reconstruction at post-mining sites. This is particularly important in situations where no topsoil is applied to cover raw spoil material dumped in the heaps, which typically contain little recent organic matter (S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005). SOM accumulation also brings a economic benefit in terms of ecosystem services (Sparling et al. 2006). Despite the importance of SOM for many ecosystem processes, at different scales, from local to global, the mechanisms of SOM sequestration are not adequately understood (Metting et al. 2001).",
        "247763da-1ed4-4930-a676-22cc1bba4e09": "2001). Only recently has more attention been paid to the various processes leading to stabilization of SOM (Six et al. 2002), including the role of soil biota in this process (Wolters 2000). Post-mining sites represent areas of large-scale and intensive disturbance, but at the same time they offer us a unique opportunity to study some important ecological questions, including those relating to processes of SOM accumulation and C sequestration in ecosystems (Scullion and Malik 2000;S \u02c7ourkova \u00e9t al. 2005). Similar patches of land are replicated by similar technologies used in time and space during mining operations which makes mining sites good models for chrono-sequence studies (Frouz et al. 2001;S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005). Some mining soil may be very variable; however heterogeneity is largely affected by geology way of mining and heaping. Advantage on our study sites is that dumped material was formed by lacustrine sediment which was deposited in horizontal layers which are quite homogeneous in large areas. These layers were then mined out in horizontally oriented slices about 2 m thick. Each slice was then mixed as a result of mining operation, transported in heap und dumped in horizontal layer about 2 m thick, this make substrate in our sites relatively homogeneous. The simplicity of post mining sites also makes them good experimental models with which to analyze processes that are difficult to study in more developed and more complex soils, such as the effects of soil biota on SOM translocation and accumulation (Frouz et al. 2001(Frouz et al. , 2006)). The principal questions of this study were: What is the rate of carbon accumulation in the aboveground woody biomass and in the soil organic matter of post mining sites? How does the soil C accumulation differ between various types of forest cover? What is the role of litter input and soil bioturbation in soil C accumulation?",

Carbon storage at the post-mining sites studied was comparable to C storage measured in another recently restored forest ecosystem (Akala and Lal 2000;S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005;Peichl et al. 2006) but the temporal dynamics of C accumulation may have affected the comparison of individual sites. For example, earlier studies have shown that the accumulation of C in soil was a little bit faster during the first 15-20 years after heap afforestation with alder and then slowed down, while the opposite was true for unreclaimed sites (S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005;Frouz and Kalc \u02c7\u0131 \u00b4k 2006). Apparently this was due to the slower initial development of vegetation at unreclaimed sites (Frouz and Kalc \u02c7\u0131 \u00b4k 2006). However, these differences were not statistically significant and both trends can best be described by linear regression (Frouz and Kalc \u02c7\u0131 \u00b4k 2006;S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005), so linear approximation can be assumed to be adequate for our sites. Ecosystem C storage has certain limits, because of limitation in tree growth and also because soil may get C saturated (Six et al. 2002). Based on previous studies of C dynamic in alder plantation and unreclaimed sites, however, we believe that these limits were not reached yet and that there is still some potential for addional C storage. As mentioned above, post mining sites under study were quite favorable for plant growth with no substrate toxicity, adequate supply of nutrients (S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al. 2005), this may not be universal condition valid for all post mining sites in general (Bradshaw 1993). Our results showed that soil C represented an important part of the total C accumulated at post mining sites.",

It should be emphasized that roots, which may represent an important contribution to total C storage (IPCC 2003), were not taken into account in our study. Hence, in some of the sites included in this study it is easily possible that belowground C storage, including that in soil and roots, may be more important than aboveground C storage. This agree with findings of Walle et al. (2001) and Jia and Akiyama (2005) who found more C below then above ground in some mature forest ecosystems. The average content of C in soil of 30 years old temperate forests varies widely around 134 t ha -1 (Brady and Weil 2002). Soil at our sites gained much less C than other temperate sites, which may indicate that there is still potential for future growth of C stock. This underlines the importance of belowground C storage which clearly requires more attention in future research and restoration efforts. In our study soil C varied widely around one half of the amount of C stored in aboveground woody biomass but there were large differences between sites afforested with different trees. The largest proportion of C stored in soil organic matter relative to C in the aboveground biomass, and the largest soil C storage, was found at sites afforested with lime and alder. This is in agreement with the conclusion by  Cannel and Dewar (1995) that deciduous trees support soil carbon storage more than conifers. In this study, no significant correlation was found between the input of plant litter and C storage in the soil. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was found between C accumulation in soil and the density of earthworms and occurrence of earthworm casts in soil profile. In sites with greater storage of C in the soil (A ? Oe ?",

This pattern suggests that C storage in soil could be supported by bioturbation activity of soil invertebrates, and earthworms in particular. This seems to be contrasting with the results of previous studies based on the exposure of litter bags accessible or nonaccessible to macrofauna, which indicated that decomposition was about 5-40% higher in the presence of macrofauna (Irmer 1995). However, the term decomposition is frequently used for any loss of litter matter from an enclosure when interpreting the results of litterbag experiments. Nevertheless, the matter loss may be caused by various processes, such as mineralization resulting in volatile CO 2 , leaching of water soluble substances or by fragmentation of the litter and its deposition in the soil in the form of soil fauna excrements. Our earlier enclosure experiments, that included both litter and the underlying mineral layer, showed that soil macrofauna did not significantly increase mineralization of organic matter, but accelerated soil mixing, resulting in the translocation of organic matter from the litter to the mineral soil (Frouz 2002;Frouz et al. 2006Frouz et al. , 2007a)). Similar conclusions were also reached by Wachendorf et al. (1997). The processing of litter by soil invertebrates may increase the stability of soil organic matter in various ways (Wolters 2000). Earthworms in particular may support stabilization of soil organic matter by its incorporation into soil aggregates and by physical binding (Lavelle and Martin 1992;Guggenberger et al. 1996;Zhang et al. 2003;Bossuyt et al. 2005). On the other hand, the supply of easily decomposable litter supports earthworm populations (Lavelle et al. 1997;Ponge 2003).",
        "33659c5f-084e-43ce-ab10-6decb7ab7c56": "1997;Ponge 2003). Hence, the abundant earthworm populations that occurred at heap sites afforested with alder and lime (Piz \u02c7l 2001), may support soil mixing and SOM stabilization, which increased the amount of C stored in the A layer. This idea is consistent with the fact that in our study both C soil storage in the A layer, and also soil C storage in the Oe ? Oa ? A layer pooled, positively correlated with earthworm density (Fig. 2). There are also some literature data that support this idea. For example, Zou and Bashkin (1998) showed that higher earthworm density correlated with higher soil C content, and Wironen and Moore (2006) indicated that massive soil mixing caused by earthworm invasion into North American forests might have increased C storage in deeper soil layers and consequently overall soil C storage. Interestingly, most of the available literature data about the impact of earthworms on ecosystem processes come from areas where earthworms are non-native species (McInerney and Bolger 2000;Bohlen et al. 2004). European post-mining sites give us an interesting opportunity to study large scale effects of earthworm colonization on soil and ecosystem processes in the area of their natural geographic distribution. This study indicate that soil pool of carbon from important contribution to overall C storage in restored ecosystems and that belowground processes that determine decomposition and or stabilization of organic matter may play more important role in C soil C storage than litter input. Thus reclamation practices should consider not only trees that support fast aboveground growth but also accumulation of soil C and should consider factors that may enhance soil biota migration to post mining sites such as habitat connectivity and communication with surrounding landscape.",

Soils are intrinsically complex systems that mediate and regulate multiple processes and functions vital for forest ecosystem restoration. Although monitoring soil attributes are critical for evaluating the success of forest restoration projects, research, and development of soil function indicators are still limited. Here, we have reviewed the most commonly reported soil indicators in forest restoration research and their recovery trajectory on a global scale. We also identified and discussed less frequently used indicators that have the potential for monitoring ecosystem recovery. We found that soil indicators have considerably increased in the literature. However, research is regionally concentrated, and a significant proportion of publications neither considered reference ecosystems (41%) nor provided basic information about soil types (<21%). The most reported indicator types were chemical (76%) (e.g., soil carbon, nitrogen, and pH). A significant proportion of the studies (46%) performed long-term evaluations (>15 years) of indicators. The majority of the indicators tended to resemble the levels of the reference ecosystem in the long term, with a few exceptions (e.g., water content and bulk density). We identified several less used but more integrative indicators with great potential for monitoring forest ecosystem recovery (e.g., aggregate stability, oxidizable carbon, soil respiration, and enzyme activity). Our results emphasize the need to effectively develop standardized soil health indicators to monitor ecosystem recovery under different conditions and expand their use in underrepresented regions.",

Forest loss and degradation negatively affect critical ecosystem attributes, including soil and water's physical and chemical status, and topography (Gann et al. 2019), directly impacting soil processes and functions (Lal 2015;Kooch et al. 2020). Forest loss and degradation alter biogeochemical C, nutrient, and water cycles, affecting the capacity of forests to regenerate or recover (Crovo et al. 2021a(Crovo et al. , 2021b)). Forest degradation hinders the provision of essential ecosystem services with consequential adverse effects on human well-being (Scherr 2019). Soils and their attributes are critical components for ecosystem functioning and, as such, are essential for the success of forest ecosystem restoration. However, soils are often not considered during restoration strategies (Farrell et al. 2020), and studies generally focus only on recovering vegetation composition and structure (Callaham et al. 2008). This limits the success of restoration efforts since ecosystem processes in degraded soils cannot sustain vegetation limiting ecosystem recovery (Hobbs et al. 2009). Soil health is defined as the \"capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans\" (Lehmann et al. 2020). The essential soil attributes for sustaining biodiversity are (1) physical (e.g., soil texture, bulk density), ( 2) chemical (e.g., cation exchange capacity, pH), and (3) biological (e.g., soil enzymes, respiration) (Lal 2016). Numerous soil functions, such as elemental cycling, water retention, and carbon sequestration, must properly occur to maintain ecological balance and promote recovery.",

Monitoring of soil health recovery must be considered during the design stage of any forest restoration plan or project (M\u00e9ndez-Toribio et al. 2021). The selection of appropriate soil indicators is essential to properly assess the recovery of soil health (Heneghan et al. 2008). Proper monitoring of soil indicators should consider the site under restoration, the control or prerestoration site, and a reference ecosystem (i.e., the soil condition to be achieved). The reference ecosystem should be based on a reference model of one or more sites close to the restoration area. These sites should have little or minimal degradation and have the same vegetation, topography, and environmental variables (including soil properties) as the area to be restored (Hernandez-Santin et al. 2021). Comparing ecological indicators between sites under restoration and reference ecosystems allows a proper evaluation of ecological restoration success. For indicators to be effective, they must meet specific criteria such as sensitivity to environmental changes and management, ease of measurement, and cost-effectiveness (Dale & Beyeler 2001). The most frequently used soil indicators focus on the physical, chemical, and biological soil properties (Allen et al. 2011). Some of these properties allow the inference of ecosystem processes and functions such as nutrient cycling, climate and water regulation, and decomposition of plant and animal residues, among others (Costantini et al. 2016). However, it is still challenging to select appropriate indicators due to the limited understanding of soil properties, the inherent variability of soils, and forest ecosystems under restoration (Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas 2018). In addition, excessive use of indicators can be ineffective and expensive. Currently, there are neither generalized suggestions for appropriate soil indicator selection nor recommendations for the evaluation time. This information could help researchers and practitioners to select the best indicator(s) and identify monitoring strategies to evaluate the recovery of soil health over time.",

The results also highlight soil indicators \"relevance in evaluating restoration activities\" progress and success. Our analysis suggests a growing interest in using soil indicators for researching and monitoring forest ecosystem restoration projects. This is reflected in the increasing number and variety of soil indicators considered in articles published in recent years. Most of this interest is probably motivated by the growing recognition of the relevance of ensuring soil functionality and enhancing ecosystem services provision during restoration projects (Robinson et al. 2012;Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al. 2016). We found that most of the research was concentrated in two countries: U.S.A. and Brazil. Only a modest fraction of research has been conducted in European, Asian, and African countries. It is critical to build up practical skills and knowledge at the local scale to increase and expand the use of soil indicators, especially in regions historically affected by forest degradation and deforestation. More than half of the publications do not incorporate basic soil classification information, which is fundamental for comparison or replicating the research. Most indicators were evaluated in the upper 30 cm disregarding that most tree rooting systems reach soil depths greater than 1 m. The lack of this information could significantly hinder the definition of adequate goals and objectives of a restoration plan, as well as the possibility of adequately assessing the recovery of soil functions and the proper selection of reference ecosystems. The latter may explain some of the observed variability between intervened sites and reference ecosystems. In addition, the lack of profile descriptions and basic horizon information limits the interpretation and extrapolation of results to other regions. We suggest that forest restoration research and practice should always include basic soil type and classification information. Worldwide, chemical indicators were the most widely used. The widespread use of chemical indicators as soil quality indicators in agronomy and forestry may have motivated its use in forest restoration. Biological indicators are considered highly sensitive compared to chemical and physical indicators (Andr\u00e9s & Mateos 2006), and their popularity has increased since the 2000s. Below we discuss the most used chemical, physical, and biological indicators and their suitability for assessing ecosystem recovery.",

Studying SOM development along restored forest chronosequences would be useful in clarifying some of the uncertainties in quantifying C turnover rates with respect to forest clearance and ensuing restoration. The development of soil organic matter in the mineral soils was studied at four depths in a 16-year-old restored jarrah forest chronosequence. The size-separated SOM fractionation along with d 13 C isotopic shift was utilised to resolve the soil C temporal and spatial changes with developing vegetation. The restored forest chronosequence revealed several important insights into how soil C is developing with age. Litter accumulation outpaced the native forest levels in 12 years after restoration. The surface soils, in general, showed increase in total C with age, but this trend was not clearly observed at lower depths. C accumulation was observed with increasing restoration age in all three SOM size-fractions in the surface 0-2 cm depth. These biodiverse forests show a trend towards accumulating C in recalcitrant stable forms, but only in the surface 0-2 cm mineral soil. A significant reverse trend was observed for the moderately labile SOM fraction for lower depths with increasing restoration age. Correlating the soil d 13 C with total C concentration revealed the re-establishment of the isotopically depleted labile to enriched refractory C continuum with soil depth for the older restored sites. This implied that from a pedogenic perspective, the restored soils are developing towards the original native soil carbon profile.",
        "5434b220-ddd5-474a-bb25-28d7a1bbe84a": "Globally, soils contain approximately 1500 Pg of C, making it the largest terrestrial C pool (Post et al. 1990;Eswaran et al. 1993;Lal 2004) and account for two or three times more carbon than the atmospheric CO 2 pool (Davidson et al. 2000). Of the estimated 1,500 Gt of organic C in soils, 250-530 Gt are in C fractions with turnover times of decades or less (Trumbore 1997). Furthermore, SOM has been gaining importance for its carbon sequestration potential in mitigation of climate change. Since soils are the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems, even a five per cent increase in the size of this pool with modified land management techniques has the potential to decrease the amount of atmospheric C by up to 16% (Baldock 2007). The effects of reforestation/change of land-use on soil C pools has potential to either release or sequester soil C (Guo and Gifford 2002;Silver et al. 2004; Lo 0 pez- Ulloa et al. 2005). The balance between deposition and decomposition of organic material primarily governs the accumulation or loss of SOC. It has been suggested that improved land management could result in sequestration of a substantial amount of soil C within a few decades and can be an option to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Pastian et al. 2000;Metting et al. 1999;Post et al. 1990). With increasing global carbon losses following disturbance/deforestation, old-growth forests have a key role in maintaining and accumulating quantities of carbon for centuries (Zhou et al. 2006;Luyssaert et al. 2008). However, large uncertainties remain in quantifying the rates of turnover of soil organic matter to the current terrestrial carbon sink (Wang and Hsieh 2002;Pacala et al. 2001).",

Studying SOM development along a reconstructed or newly formed land-use chronosequence would be extremely informative in clarifying some of these uncertainties, particularly with respect to the rate at which SOM accumulates/depreciates when factors such as site preparation, stocking, fertilisation, fire management are considered as part of post-mining restoration (Paul et al. 2002). The increased loss of SOM in initial post-surface mined areas following restoration is probably similar to mechanical disturbance following whole-tree harvesting where 6% of C was lost (Johnson and Curtis 2001). Restored forest soils in Australia have shown a general trend of soil carbon accumulation over time that can at least match the natural undisturbed forests in terms of total carbon concentration (Schwenke et al. 2000a, b;Koch and Samsa 2007;Tibbett 2010). SOM is a biochemical continuum ranging from fresh plant detritus which readily undergoes microbial degradation to the highly stabilised portions formed through interactions with soil mineral particles and aggregates (Ko \u00a8gel-Knabner et al. 2008). However, the majority of measurements were based on various forms of total soil carbon (Guo and Gifford 2002) measured using either dry combustion (Van Moort and De Vries 1970) or organic carbon (wet oxidation; Walkley and Black 1934). These methods provide generally useful information; but provide little discrimination of SOM (Gartzia-Bengoetxea et al. 2009). A more informative approach is to partition SOM having mean residence time varying from months to centuries into conceptual pools with different levels of stability (Christensen 2001;von Lutzow et al. 2007). These pools usually grouped as active, slow or intermediate and passive provide more advanced information especially when monitoring the SOM changes in a recovering ecosystem.",

Soil aggregation increases in less disturbed systems and that organic materials within soil aggregates (microaggregates) have lower decomposition rates than those located outside of aggregates (Oades 1984;Six et al. 2000). But the time-scale of this aggregation process is not well understood. The d 13 C of the SOM and its size separated fractions can also help resolve the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation (Garten 2006;Balesdent and Mariotti 1996;Ehleringer et al. 2000). Stable isotope values can reflect vegetation and soil management changes over short-(50-100 years) and longer-term (100 s of years) time scales (Boutton et al. 1998;Krull et al. 2005). Well drained, relatively undisturbed soils often show increasing d 13 C and d 15 N with soil depth (Mariotti et al. 1980;Nadelhoffer and Fry 1988;Powers and Schlesinger 2002). Based on the time-frame of the post-disturbance restored chronosequence studied, we predicted to see a progression in C accumulation where coarser labile SOM fractions approached the levels in natural forest more quickly (chronosequence time) than for the finer, more recalcitrant fractions. The d 13 C gradient with soil depth will be progressively re-establish with increasing restoration age. In order to test our predictions, we tracked the post-disturbance developmental trajectories followed by the restored south west Australian jarrah forest chronosequence based on: (i) the quantitative development of SOM dynamics with time, for both whole soil (total C) and sizefractionated SOM; (ii) monitoring temporal and spatial (depth) changes in d 13 C stable isotope.",

First, it refers to a group of salt-tolerant plants belonging to nine orders, 20 families, 27 genera, and roughly 70 species. These plants have natural capacity to cope with changes in water and sediment salinity. Second, it refers to complex plant communities that fringe tropical and subtropical (32\u00b0 N to 32\u00b0 S) shores and delimited by major ocean currents and temperature (Saenger, 2002). Mangroves are also well adapted to deal with natural stressors such as high temperature, anaerobic sediments, and extreme tides. Mangrove forests are highly productive carbon sinks. They absorb and sequester vast amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Their carbon stock capacity reaches as much as 1,023 tC ha -1 , an estimate that is three times larger than those of other tropical forest ecosystems (Donato et al., 2011). Bulk of this stock is contained in their sediment or peat. Despite the vital role in climate change mitigation, mangroves are in danger of complete denudation (Kathiresan & Bingham, 2001;Richards & Friess, 2016). In many regions, they are being converted to aquaculture ponds, sewage disposal sites, human settlement areas and industrial ports (Saenger, 2002;Garcia et al., 2014). Globally they have dwindled to 15.2 million ha, and continuously shedding off at a rate of 102,000 ha yr -1 (FAO, 2007).

Seeing the dismal trend of mangrove deforestation, efforts to rehabilitate degraded mangroves through reforestation became more visible over the past three decades (Puhlin et al., 2017). Mangrove rehabilitation projects were seen in many community-based coastal resource management programs of the government and local communities. Among the government's largest mangrove rehabilitation efforts was the National Greening Program which started in 2011 (Adornado, 2016). This program has tapped local communities and local government units to implement mangrove planting which has now re-vegetated 45,000 ha of denuded coasts. IUCN (2012) noted that it is just a matter of time that such efforts will be soon rewarded. With the recent inclusion of mangroves (as blue carbon ecosystem) in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), more projects on mangrove carbon fi nancing and trading are expected to come over the next few years.

Restoration of degraded lands has been challenging. It involves careful planning and adopting land use options (Nkonya et al., 2015). Land use options promoting sustainability and livelihood security are desirable by society for enhancing food, fodder and firewood as well as mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Kumar et al., 2019). Eco-restoration can be defined as process of the recovery of a degraded ecosystem (Martin, 2017). Tree-grass based system has been a prominent eco-restoration strategy in rainfed tropical condition (Qi et al., 2019;Singh et al., 2012). They are sustainable land use management systems in which trees are grown along with livestock management and grasses (Kumar et al., 2019). To cope with the problem of decreasing per capita availability and land productivity tree-grass based system provides a solution by efficiently harnessing available natural resources (Ghosh et al., 2019a). Tree-grass interaction changes a) fodder productivity, b) organic matter input to soil, c) microbial diversity (Dornbush, 2007). Hence, we assume that tree-grass interaction will also influence eco-restoration efficiency and its extent through different degree of services like carbon sequestration, enzyme activities, etc. Global conference on climate change, popularly known as \"Paris Climate Change Agreement\" has given emphasis on carbon capture and storage. Under Paris Agreement India agreed to develop an additional 'carbon sink' of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover. Under such scenario, it is essential to test whether the eco-restoration of land with tree-grass can fulfill the commitment (Haghverdi and Kooch, 2020). However, the process of eco-restoration takes time; hence, we need to identify the critical indicators which will underlie the whole process as well as will define the efficiency of restoration strategies.",

Soil microbial processes are the heart of success of ecorestoration as they influence physical and biological properties of land. Hence, indicators identified from biological and chemical properties will be representative. Development of biochemical indicators which can effectively demonstrate the impact of ecosystem recovery is an active area of research. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for sustaining agroecosystems, and is key for sustainable maintenance of soil health. Soil being the largest terrestrial carbon (C) sink, is capable of sequestering 2and 3-times more carbon than atmosphere and vegetation, respectively (Ramesh et al., 2019). Therefore, a small change in soil carbon sequestration through eco-restoration strategies will have a drastic impact on the climate change. The SOC has different pools and fractions including total organic C (TOC), particulate organic matter associated C (POMC), microbial biomass C (MBC), water soluble C (WSC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO 4 -C), recalcitrant C (RC) etc. POMC is a transitory pool of organic C between fresh plant residues and humified organic matter (Gregorich and Janzen, 1996), WSC, KMnO 4 -C are the most sensitive indicators for land use changes and useful for identifying changes at early stages of eco-restoration (Haynes, 2005). MBC is an indicator of active biomass and has been used to assess land use changes and eco-restoration efficiency (Bongiorno et al., 2019).

They are also indicative of biological equilibrium, fertility, quality, and changes in the biological status of soil due to pollution (Utobo and Tewari, 2015). There has been many studies on response of land restoration strategies to SOC storage in temperate climates (Liu et al., 2016;Pang et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019).

Although biodiversity restoration is pivotal to circumvent this situation, the techniques for restoring old-growth savannas are still limited and the restoration outcomes remain unpredictable. Here, we use a trait-based approach to understand the functional outcomes of ecological restoration via direct seeding in a Brazilian savanna (cerrado, hereafter neotropical savanna). We compared the functional composition from woody and non-woody component, total biomass and biomass allocation of a restored relative to a degraded savanna (abandoned pasture) dominated by exotic grasses and a well-preserved old-growth native savanna. We found that the functional composition of restored communities was very similar to those dominated by exotic grasses, both characterized by a greater dominance of species with acquisitive traits, higher above-ground biomass, and lower investment in root biomass. In contrast, the native vegetation exhibited a dominance of conservative traits and higher investment in belowground rather than aboveground biomass. Even though the acquisitive traits in the restored savanna allow a fast aboveground biomass accumulation and soil cover, the lower belowground biomass investment in the restored savanna may limit its resistance and resilience to droughts and fires. Our findings suggest that restoration efforts in neotropical savanna should focus on fostering the establishment of slow-growing species to recover the ecosystem properties provided by the high biodiversity in neotropical savannas.",

Especially in this decade, the United Nations will support a \"Decade on Ecosystem Restoration\" from 2021 to 2030, an attempt to restore lost ecosystem services and stem the rapid decline of biodiversity (UNEP & FAO 2020, Strassburg et al., 2020). Most restoration knowledge is focused on forest successional trajectories, involving mainly woody plants (Silveira et al. 2020;Veldman, Buisson, et al. 2015). However, the oldgrowth savannas occupy >40% of the land surface (Veldman, Buisson, et al., 2015). These old-growth ecosystems include neotropical savannas with open-canopy where >50% of the ground layer is covered by grasses (Veldman, Buisson, et al., 2015). Although most of the vegetation is composed of grass and herbs, these components of vegetation have been widely neglected for conservation (Veldman, Overbeck, et al. 2015;Parr et al. 2014;Bond 2016). Thus, studies seeking to understand how to effectively restore neotropical savannas are imperative. Achieving restoration success in neotropical savannas depends on adequate context-specific knowledge to restore functional diversity, ecosystem functions and resilience (Buisson et al. 2020). In recent decades, the Brazilian savanna (cerrado, hereafter neotropical savanna) lost 88 Mha (46%) of its original cover, and only 20% remains well-preserved (Strassburg et al., 2017). The invasion of non-native plant species is among the main causes of species loss and ecosystem degradation (Veldman et al., 2014). These invasions occur by conversion of native vegetation to livestock pasture or agricultural fields that deplete the seed and especially the underground bud bank, trapping the system in a degraded state.",
        "b55246f9-7eff-402b-805d-183d1dcb37ad": "Therefore, these areas have slow natural regeneration and requires active restoration practices (Ferreira et al. 2017). Meanwhile, neotropical savanna restoration is still in its infancy relative to forest restoration and the success of most existing techniques remain uncertain at a large scale. The restoration of these ecosystems requires very different approaches than major forest restoration based on tree plantation and successional trajectories (Veldman et al. 2019;Andrade et al. 2015). In fire-prone ecosystems, natural plant populations persist mostly through clonal reproduction (Pausas et al. 2018), and the investment in belowground structures (e.g., roots and bud banks) is the main mechanism by which plants re-sprout after disturbances, boosting savanna resilience over disturbances (Ott et al. 2019). Even though there is an increasing number of neotropical savanna restoration studies, just a small number of successful models applies to the broad scale (Bustamante et al. 2019;Schmidt et al. 2019). Furthermore, the main challenge in restoration practices of neotropical savannas is the recovery of the belowground component of these communities as a way to ensure higher resilience. Restoration practices that aim to convert abandoned pastures into biodiverse savannas need to deal with the potential invasion from persistent seed-and/or bud-bank of exotic grasses (Gorgone-barbosa et al. 2016;Dantas-Junior et al. 2018). After land clearing and soil liming, alien grasses are often introduced as forage to feed the livestock or disperse from former pastures in the vicinity. Alien grasses frequently outcompete the native species when the soil is disturbed through liming, altering the ecosystem to a degraded state which also limits savannas' restoration success (D 'Antonio & Meyerson 2002;Damasceno et al. 2018;Zenni et al. 2019).",
        "d096f03a-ec9a-4e51-a008-44f3223b9436": "2018;Zenni et al. 2019). The potential restoration activity to reduce non-native invasion is to strategically increase the abundance of native species that are functionally similar to the non-native species (D 'Antonio & Chambers, 2011;Funk, Cleland, et al. 2008). Invasive grasses are usually fast-growing species and exhibit high aboveground productivity (Milbau & Nijs 2004). Generating fast soil cover by native grasses is a restoration practice which could potentially hamper the invasive potential of exotic grasses (Sampaio et al. 2019). However, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects, self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed \"soil legacies\" (Hess et al. 2019, Wolfsdorf et al 2021), and prevent the establishment of native species. Evaluating the functional composition of restored communities may offer insights about restoration success and help to predict vegetation trajectories. Trait-based approaches have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms driving community assembly (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012) and have been extended to explain ecosystem functions and processes (Funk et al. 2008). This approach considers the ecological niche as a result of the knowledge of different axes of plant-trait variation. One of the most comprehensive trait variation axes is the fast-slow continuum (Wright et al. 2004). Environments with high resources are characterized by the dominance of plants with traits associated with fast resource acquisition and the maximum allocation of resources to growth (Wright et al. 2004). Conversely, in environments where soil nutrients or climate limits plant growth, we expect dominant species to exhibit traits that reflect the conservation of long-lived tissues (Oliveira et al. 2021;Wright et al. 2004;Jardine et al. 2020). Several studies have used a trait-based approach for improving ecological restoration outcomes (Funk et al.",
        "dc3a17ae-52db-4b0b-a58c-c8b9a23ece5d": "Several studies have used a trait-based approach for improving ecological restoration outcomes (Funk et al. 2008;Laughlin 2014) and a growing number of empirical studies have linked specific traits to plant establishment, survival, and persistence in restored systems (Larson & Funk 2016;Zirbel & Brudvig 2020). However, trait-based approaches of neotropical savannas restoration practices remain unknown, especially field-based studies with a focus on individual traits (Laughlin 2014). Several studies use traits from literature databases, not taking into account the trait-dependent context (Passaretti et al. 2020;Coutinho et al. 2019;Cava et al. 2018). Several savanna species tend to grow slowly and have high tissue construction costs, which allow them to persist in habitats with low nutrient and water availability (Maracahipes et al., 2018;Viani, Rodrigues, Dawson, & Oliveira, 2011). Early stages of forest restoration are known for their trees with acquisitive traits and even old-growth forests have more acquisitive traits than the woody-component of neotropical savannas (Maracahipes et al. 2018). However, savannas and grasslands most likely do not follow successional trajectories because these ecosystems are dominated by resprouters (Pilon et al. 2020;Pausas et al. 2018;Bond & Midgley 2001a). Principally in these fire-prone ecosystems, the fast-slow strategy is also linked to specific reproductive strategies (Enright et al. 2014). Overall, acquisitive species tend to reproduce through seeds, that are usually small and with high germination rates, while rapidly growing aboveground (Power et al. 2011;Verd\u00fa 2000). In contrast, conservative species tend to resprout as a main reproductive strategy, they grow more slowly and allocate a greater proportion of their resources belowground (Eller & Oliveira 2017;Power et al. 2011;Verd\u00fa 2000).",

In the neotropical savanna vegetation, the main technique known for large-scale restoration is direct seeding (Schmidt et al. 2019;Pellizzaro et al. 2017;Sampaio et al. 2019). By using an expressive number of seeds to quickly cover the soil, this technique is likely to favor mostly seeders/acquisitive species, which may be a problem if the goal is to restore an ecosystem where resprouters/conservative species are prevalent in the community (Pilon et al. 2020). In this study, we used a trait-based approach to understand the functional composition of savanna communities and offer insights into the functional outcome of current restoration practices in the neotropical savanna. We evaluated the functional composition of a 3-years-old restored savanna by direct-seeding when compared to areas dominated by exotic grasses (abandoned pastures) and well-preserved old-growth vegetation. We evaluated multiple leaf traits (see Table 1) of 61 native species, and species from restored and invaded savanna communities. Additionally, we measured exotic cover, bare soil cover and below-and aboveground biomass as biomass allocation has major implications for ecosystems resilience. We addressed the following questions and hypotheses: \uf0b7 What is the functional composition of restored savanna vegetation via direct seeding compared to pastures and native savannas? Because direct seeding uses mostly seeders/fast growing plants, we expect the restored vegetation through this technique to be dominated by acquisitive traits, thus occupying the same functional space as abandoned pastures (H1). \uf0b7 Does the restored neotropical savanna recover the functional diversity and biomass allocation of an old-growth state? We expect restored savanna to have higher Functional dispersion (FDis) and Functional richness (FR) than abandoned pasture, and exhibit higher soil cover and higher aboveground investment that might avoid invasive grasses. Besides, the higher aboveground biomass allocation in restored communities in comparison to higher belowground allocation in native communities may have implications to resilience to disturbance (H2).",

We evaluated how a neotropical savanna restored area varied in its communityweighted mean (CWM) trait composition, and whether total biomass and biomass allocation changed when compared to the degraded state (abandoned pasture) and well preserved old-growth savannas (native). Multivariate CWM trait composition differed strongly between native, restored and abandoned pasture areas. The restored communities and abandoned pasture showed a greater dominance of species with more acquisitive traits while the native vegetation presented conservative traits. Hence, the functional composition of a restored neotropical savanna via direct seeding is more similar to an abandoned pasture than old-growth reference area. Our results showed that the species pool used in direct-seeding is an effective technique to establish a large number of acquisitive native species with high aboveground biomass investment and provides a fast gain in soil cover. Nevertheless, this fast aboveground recovery did not guarantee resistance to invasion. In contrast, the restored neotropical savanna maintained lower belowground investment compared to the reference system, which implies in a lower vegetation resilience against common local disturbance such as fires (Ott et al. 2019;Pausas et al. 2018b).",

Here, we compared ecological outcomes among (1) 12-15-year-old coffee agroforests established with several native shade trees, (2) 12-15-year-old high-diversity restoration plantations, and (3) reference old-growth forests, within a landscape restoration project in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We compared the aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and abundance, richness, and composition of trees, and the regenerating saplings in the three forest types. In addition, we investigated the landscape drivers of natural regeneration in the restoration plantations and coffee agroforests. Reference forests had a higher abundance of trees and regenerating saplings, but had similar levels of species richness compared to coffee agroforests. High-diversity agroforests and restoration plantations did not differ in tree abundance. However, compared to restoration plantations, agroforests showed higher abundance and species richness of regenerating saplings, a higher proportion of animal-dispersed species, and higher canopy cover. The abundance of regenerating saplings declined with increasing density of coffee plants, thus indicating a potential trade-off between productivity and ecological benefits. High-diversity coffee agroforests provide a cost-effective and ecologically viable alternative to high-diversity native tree plantations for large-scale forest restoration within agricultural landscapes managed by local communities, and should be included as part of the portfolio of reforestation options used to promote the global agenda on forest and landscape restoration.",
        "94308e66-1aa4-477d-b2fd-8dae77499236": "The loss and fragmentation of native forest ecosystems has been primarily driven by agriculture expansion, as a consequence of the growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber to sustain the rapidly increasing global human population (Lamb et al. 2005;B\u00e1ez et al. 2011). Intensively managed production systems that remove all trees from the landscape have particularly negative consequences, while traditional agroforestry, such as shade coffee production, re-establishes trees in the landscapes and uses eco-friendly approaches of production that can aid forest conservation (Garrity et al. 2006;Latawiec et al. 2016;Kremen & Merenlender 2018). In this context, we address the potential for agroforestry systems to mitigate the degradation caused by intensive agriculture and restore native forest ecosystems in degraded landscapes (Moguel & Toledo 1999;Vieira et al. 2009). To reach ambitious global restoration goals while supporting the needs of a growing population, forest restoration initiatives should be integrated with other land uses (e.g. agricultural activities) as a strategy for improving restoration cost-effectiveness and attractiveness to farmers (Adams et al. 2016;Brancalion & Chazdon 2017), thereby improving both biodiversity conservation and human well-being at the landscape scale, an approach known as forest and landscape restoration (FLR) (Mansourian et al. 2005). Although recent studies have explored the costeffectiveness of different restoration approaches for ecosystem services provisioning (Birch et al. 2010;Molin et al. 2018), more information is needed about the differential performance of restoration approaches that include food-producing species. The inclusion of food trees in restoration, including exotic species, was already recommended for improved restoration success in terms of human population involvement (Brancalion et al. 2014;Muler et al. 2018), but this approach has not been rigorously assessed so far. By integrating restoration with agriculture production, restoration costs can be minimized (Brancalion et al. 2012), the pressure for more agricultural land can be mitigated (Latawiec et al.",
        "ab52eabb-53d7-4d62-a6ba-67af7dd25aca": "2016), and the provision of ecosystem services can be improved (Brancalion et al. 2012;Uriarte & Chazdon 2016). Besides, forest-based production systems can increase landscape connectivity in degraded and deforested landscapes, benefiting biodiversity conservation (Bhagwat et al. 2008;Harvey et al. 2008;Uezu et al. 2008). Agroforestry systems are among the most well-known production systems that integrate agriculture with environmental recovery (Lamb et al. 2005;Souza et al. 2016;Schulz & Schr\u00f6der 2017;Harrison & Miccolis 2018). These systems consist of land uses where woody perennial plants are grown with agricultural crops or cattle pastures in a spatial arrangement or temporal sequence (Appanah et al. 2015;Hillbrand et al. 2017). Worldwide, agroforestry systems have been successfully used for agricultural production, especially in poor countries, where farmers have little access to resources for investing in external inputs (Besseau et al. 2018). High-diversity agroforestry has also been promoted as a cost-effective restoration approach (Ramos et al. 2009;Braga et al. 2018), which is more likely to be adopted by farmers (Souza et al. 2016;Besseau et al. 2018). Furthermore, some authors argue that agroforestry systems promote greater human involvement with forests, providing a sense of reconnection with nature that results in higher conservation outcomes (Miller 2005;Folke et al. 2011;Raymond et al. 2013). Coffee agroforestry systems offer high potential for tropical forest restoration (Toledo & Moguel 2012;De Beenhouwer et al. 2013;Valencia et al. 2016;Irizarry et al. 2018).",

This production system is based on the use of shade trees, which can consist of several native species, and results in a well-developed forest structure (Braga et al. 2018), while coffee-a shade-tolerant small tree-grows in the understory. Coffee agroforestry systems have been widely used in many regions around the world, and have been shown to yield high levels of both coffee production and restoration and conservation outcomes (Perfecto et al. 2005;De Beenhouwer et al. 2013;Cerda et al. 2017;Nesper et al. 2017;Robusti et al. 2017). Despite the environmental advantages of coffee agroforestry in comparison to traditional treeless agricultural land uses, it is not clear whether these systems produce similar ecological outcomes as widely implemented active restoration approaches, and thus could be used even in contexts where restoration is mandatory. High-diversity restoration plantations have been widely used in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil to comply with the Forest Code, which mandates forest restoration in degraded landscapes (Rodrigues et al. 2011;Brancalion et al. 2016). Agroforestry could be used as a pathway for restoration in conjunction with restoration plantations and other strategies in an FLR scenario, where the economic benefits of agroforestry could engage landowners in restoration that generates multiple benefits. To investigate the potential of coffee agroforestry as a pathway for restoration in this context, we compared ecological outcomes among (1) 12-15-year-old coffee agroforests established with several native shade trees, (2) 12-15-year-old high-diversity native tree restoration plantations, established with no food production purposes, and (3) reference old-growth forests, within an FLR project in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We also identified landscape drivers of the attributes of these forests, in order to discuss general recommendations for both coffee agroforests and restoration plantations, aiming for FLR.",
        "de3aeaca-f0cf-48a7-b6e6-695eddb77de7": "In agricultural landscapes, where farmers heavily rely on land use for their well-being, and where needs for productive land uses present conflicts for establishing restoration plantations, we found that coffee agroforestry is a promising component of FLR contributing to both tree diversity and bioeconomy. Coffee agroforestry may have equivalent (or better) ecological outcomes than conventional restoration plantations for tropical forest restoration in the studied agricultural landscape. In addition, most of the coffee agroforestry sites we evaluated achieved the regional quality standards for canopy cover and abundance of regenerating saplings suggesting that forest restoration is following a desirable trajectory. While the restoration type was a significant determinant of forest attributes 12-15 years after implementation-with agroforests having higher abundance, richness, and proportion of animal-dispersed species of regenerating saplings than restoration plantations-more isolated restoration plantings showed lower regenerating sapling abundance and richness, indicating the relevance of landscape considerations such as spatial arrangement of interventions for ecological restoration. As expected, compared to reference forests, both restoration treatments showed lower tree and regenerating sapling abundances and species richness. Even though agroforests were initially implemented with lower tree densities, they showed higher AGB-especially when it contained more tree species-probably because landowners are more likely to tend for these systems in the long term for their direct benefits (Vieira et al. 2009) and because they are closer to their residences. Nevertheless, results varied among forests. Surprisingly, reference forests presented high plot variation in AGB, probably because some of them are near (approximately 50 m) to forest edges, and changes in microclimate conditions and human-mediated disturbances associated with this environment may have also reduced reference forest AGB (Magnago et al. 2016). As both agroforests and restoration plantations are usually carried out in areas less than 50 m from edge, the references selected are valuable guidelines for restoration in the region. At the landscape scale, isolation was an important factor in defining regenerating sapling proportion of animal-dispersed individuals and tree AGB in restoration plantings.",
        "ee5f02d9-1eee-425d-a57e-f80b02c3b510": "Other studies have reported limited regeneration of native woody species in isolated approximately 10-year-old restoration plantations in the Atlantic Forest region (C\u00e9sar et al. 2018), yet older plantations can have a high abundance and richness of regenerating plants (Bertacchi et al. 2016). Periodically cleaning the understory by weeding is a common practice to favor coffee plants in agroforestry systems (Boreux et al. 2016). This may explain the limited richness of regenerating saplings in the agroforest understory, which was farther than other ecological indicators to achieving the values attesting forest restoration compliance in S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. However, we found more abundant and diversified native woody species regenerating in the understory of agroforests than in restoration plantations. Possibly, this is caused by greater attraction of seed dispersers (Viani et al. 2015), because this system provides better habitat for vertebrates (Perfecto et al. 2003;Komar 2006;Caudill et al. 2015). In addition, the greater abundance of natural regeneration may be related to the higher canopy cover in agroforests, which may provide a more favorable habitat to seedling establishment by suppressing invasive grasses. Regardless, results reinforce the high ecological restoration value of high-diversity agroforests in some agricultural landscapes. High-diversity restoration plantations have been successfully used for decades in the Atlantic Forest region (Rodrigues et al. 2009), and there are many sites with biomass stocks and tree species richness with comparable levels to oldgrowth forests (Garcia et al. 2016). However, restoration plantations require intensive labor and high financial investments for at least 2-3 years after implementation to succeed (Ferez et al. 2015;Brancalion et al. 2019). Besides, young restoration plantations do not provide direct financial benefits to farmers, who are often unable to invest sufficient resources to support the development of successful restoration trajectories in native tree plantations.",
        "c292eebb-91bb-444f-9c89-fc970b3f838b": "In other cases, farmers may find alternative ways to profit from restoration plantations, such as cutting fences for allowing cattle grazing in plantation understory, a common problem in the region especially in the dry season, when pastures are dry and farmers have to complement cattle feeding. In extreme cases, young second-growth forests are recut to use the land for agriculture (Reid et al. 2019). In this context, agroforests can be considered a garden for farmers, who manage and produce several other products besides coffee (i.e. timber, fruits, Restoration Ecology September 2020 1140 Ecological outcomes of agroforests and restoration and honey), thus maintaining and protecting these forest patches (de Oliveira & Carvalhaes 2016; Souza et al. 2016). It is necessary to investigate more deeply the social and economic factors that motivate landowners to carefully manage the forest type under restoration. Our results corroborate the idea that more constant monitoring and maintenance carried out by farmers may be an advantage and the main cause for the higher ecological outcomes of agroforests than conventional forest restoration plantations in the study region (Vieira et al. 2009;Brancalion et al. 2012). In the study region, costs for establishing agroforestry and restoration plantations are around USD 3,000 and USD 4,800 per hectare, respectively (L. Cullen 2019, Institute of Ecological Research -IPE, personal communication). Thus, agroforestry can be a cost-effective pathway for restoration that provides direct economic benefits for farmers, especially in the early years. However, managing coffee agroforests for restoration may require navigating complex trade-offs between natural regeneration and coffee production, as the abundance of regenerating saplings was negatively associated with the abundance of coffee plants. For instance, we found that coffee abundance should be, in general, lower than 1,600 individuals per hectare to support the minimum legally accepted understory recolonization by native plants at the age of 15. This is a low density of  coffee plants for shade systems (Baggio et al.",
        "39bc8c9d-9ebb-40ec-ab6d-39623ee703f5": "This is a low density of  coffee plants for shade systems (Baggio et al. 1997;Soto-Pinto et al. 2000), which in turn could make shade coffee production no longer attractive to landowners. We found an exception of a productive coffee agroforest with almost 2,000 coffee plants per hectare harboring more than 3,000 native regenerating saplings per hectare. It suggests that it is somehow possible to keep good levels of native tree species recruitment with higher densities of coffee plants. Thus, we suggest that further studies investigate which cropping and restoration practices may lead to these results. One alternative to be tested would be to plant high abundance of coffee at the moment of agroforestry implementation, and manage it in the first years, when higher light availability may allow for good coffee yields in the shade of developing native plants, as is frequently done in some regions in Brazil (Baggio et al. 1997;Campanha et al. 2004). After this period, the density of coffee plants would be reduced or the system could be abandoned for forest recovery. In this context, high-diversity coffee agroforests would be a pathway for restoration-a transient land use used to facilitate native forest recovery while providing income for landowners for a few years (Vieira et al. 2009). Also, pruning and thinning native trees may thus be necessary to maintain coffee production (van Oijen et al. 2010) during restoration development. While the impacts of these practices require further studies, it may in fact benefit forest restoration (Swinfield et al. 2016). We are neither advocating for the sole use of agroforestry systems for forest restoration nor that coffee agroforestry systems will always have better outcomes than highdiversity restoration plantations, especially in the long term. We argue instead that managing agroforests for restoration requires looking at the landscape level and integrating ecological and production data, as well as the perception of farmers on the pros and cons of these systems, in order to achieve both socioeconomic and environmental benefits through forest restoration.",

Fortunatel y, restoring the ''red desert'' under the new federal forestry policy, by re-establi shing vegetatio n, improvin g soil quality, and establishing forests, has emerged as the region's top priority (Liu et al., 2004;Zheng et al., 2004;Yan et al., 2007 ). How to restore such a ''deserted'' landscape to enhance ecosystem functions (i.e., soil fertility and carbon sequestration), meet government goals, and contribute to the climate change portfolio is an imperative question. We designed a long-term Forest Restoration Experime ntal Project (FREP) in the ''red desert'' region (Taihe County, Jiangxi province) to explore the effectiveness of the restoration and the recovery of ecosystem functions. Soil organic carbon is closely associated with a wide range of physical, chemical and biologica l properties of soil, and thus plays a critical role in almost all soil processes and functioning (Harris et al., 1996;Nambiar, 1997;Smith et al., 2000 ).",
        "a54d294f-9414-418f-9981-4cad5b8b3854": "The total soil organic carbon content (TC) has long been recognized as a key component of soil quality (Reeves, 1997 ), and thus TC maintenanc e in the restoration is a major determinan t of the soil productivity and long-term stability of the restored ecosystem. Meanwhile, TC storage has been widely considered as a promising measure for mitigating global climate change through carbon sequestratio n in the soil (Lal, 2004(Lal, , 2005 ) ). Soil nutrients are indicators of ecosystem productivity (Vitousek, 1984 ), especially, soil nitrogen and phosphorus in the red soil region (Liu et al., 2004 ). Nitrogen and phosphorus are considered the most important limiting elements for vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems (Chapin et al., 1986;Vitousek and Howarth, 1991 ). The amount of plant available -nitrogen (Av-N) and -phosphorus (Av-P) constrains both natural and managed ecosystems, including non-fertilized agricultural land productivity (Seneviratne, 2000 ). At longer time scales (decadal or centurial ) for typical ecosystem developmen t, the major source of phosphorus is from rock weathering, while nitrogen is of atmospheric depositio n (Manzoni et al., 2010). Thus, plants growing on young soils are often nitrogen limited, while vegetation on older, highly weathere d soils (like red soils in our study region) is often phosphorus limited (Jobbagy and Jackson, 2001;Reich and Oleksyn, 2004 ). These broad-scale trends in soil properties, coupled with smaller scale heterogeneity in soil-vegetation interactions , produce a wider range of soil nutrient availabili ty and patterns of nutrient limitations. This in turn provides an indication of soil biochemical coupling mechanisms between soil organic carbon and nutrients resulting from soil weathering, roots transferring, and decomposing of plant tissues and residues (Reich and Oleksyn, 2004;Townsend et al., 2007 ).",
        "cb3bef96-abf5-429c-907f-905ff3f9c153": "It is important, thus, to quantify soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and their available forms during forest restoration processes to further determine their interactions with soil organic carbon in different forest restoration types. It is often difficult to clearly select certain chemical, physical, and biological indices to represent soil quality because of the dynamic interactiv e nature of these indices and involved processes and functions (Schoenholtz et al., 2000 ). Some researchers simply propose functioning characteristic (e.g., mineralization N) as an indicator (Doran and Parkin, 1994;Reganold and Palmer, 1995;Powers et al., 1998 ). The complicati on, exists however because there is seldom a one-to-one relationship between a function and the indicator; more likely, a given function (e.g., sustain biological productivity ) is supported by a number of soil propertie s, while any given soil property may be relevant to several soil functions simultaneou sly (Burger and Kelting, 1999 ). For example, soil organic matter plays a role in almost every soil function (Harris et al., 1996;Nambiar, 1997 ). Also, many soil chemical properties directly influence microbiological processes via nutrient and carbon supply relationship, and these processes, together with soil physical-chemical processes determine (1) the capacity of soils to hold, supply and cycle carbon, and (2) the movement and availability of nutrients (Powers et al., 1998 ). In our study, we selected TC, nitrogen, phospho rus, and their available forms to quantify how restoration may affect their quantities, and explore their multidimension al relations of the biochemi cal ratios with soil organic carbon accumulations in the ecosystem restoration processes. Furthermore , arguments also have been raised about using volumetr ic (kg ha \u00c01 ) or gravimetric (g kg \u00c01 ) units in the soil chemical property analyses (Doran and Parkin, 1996 ).",

We used gravimet ric measureme nts in our nutrient analyses because of the similarities in our physical property (soil bulk density) measure ments (Table 1). It is often difficult and challenging to predict the restoration rate and trajectory of soil organic carbon accumulation and nutrients recovery, although it is essential to evaluate the effectivenes s of the restoration efforts. Jackson and Hobbs (2009) suggested that active intervention may promote fast ecosystem recovery, even on severely altered sites. They further warned that estimating the trajectory of restoration is more challenging because the knowledge of the ecosystem origin and its history is often unavailable, and often spans more than the past few decades. Furthermore, the restoration pathways are often quite different depending on the type of restoration; for example, soil properties restoration (Paul et al., 2010) is different from vegetation restoration (Ashton et al., 2001). Fortunately , the local natural reserves and protected areas in our study area provide an ideal trajectory for our FREP study. The focus of this study was to assess the overall impact of forest restoration with local climax species on soil organic carbon contents, soil N, P, Av-N, and Av-P, to evaluate relationship s between the TC and soil N, P, Av-N, Av-P, and their biochemical ratios, and tentative ly to explore their relative recovery trajectories. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether forest restoration with local climax species improves soil organic carbon contents , soil N and P, and their available forms; (2) whether soil organic carbon has a positive relationship with soil N, P, Av-N, Av-P, and/or their biochemical ratios during restoration processes; and (3) what the recovery trajectories of TC and TN may exist for the FREP restoration.",

The observed differences between restoration and control are consisten t with previous studies indicating that restoration results in carbon gains (Huang et al., 2012) and nutrient availabilities (Liu et al., 2011 ). Successful restoration often requires brave and pioneering actions to interrupt the negative feedbacks that lead to long-term, sustained degradat ion and to mitigate the constrain ts imposed by abiotic condition s in the degraded system (McVicar et al., 2010 ). Our case study did successfully involve innovative and aggressive measures to introduce local climax species to restore soil fertility, biodivers ity, ecosystem function, and economic values of the barren lands (FAO, 1989;Wei et al., 2012;Xie et al., 2012 ). Usually, forest regeneration paradigm is considered to be a natural process, and it is how forest succession and developmen t should occur without human disturbance (Jackson and Hobbs, 2009 ). Addition ally, hardness-tolerant exotics were considered as an important initial component, accompani ed by compatible native forest species, for stabilizin g and modifying degraded sites. As a result, the local native species will dominate the landscape through successional competit ion processes (Otsamo et al., 1996 ). In contrast, the success in the FREP site, which included active restoration with local climax species, would provide valuable information in combating over 204 M ha of degraded red soils in tropical and subtropical regions of southern China, even worldwid e (Xu et al., 2003 ). We observed similar soil nutrient accumulation capabiliti es within restoration functiona l groups (Fig. 2 and Table 3).

Methods We conducted a meta-analysis based on 21 publications to assess the effects of different afforestation modes as well as controlling factors of SOC stocks on the Loess Plateau of China. Results Compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations could significantly increase the response size of SOC stocks by 28%. For different species combinations, tree-shrub mixtures were more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks. In climatelimited regions (MAT <8 \u00b0C, MAP <500 mm), the response size of SOC stocks of mixed-species plantations was 34% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the response size of SOC stocks at young (< 10 yr) and mature stages (> 20 yr). Compared with abandoned land, afforestation on cropland, especially mixedspecies plantations, could increase the SOC stocks by 10%. Additionally, compared with monoculture plantations, a stronger coupling relationship was observed between the soil total nitrogen (STN) and SOC stocks in mixed-species plantations.

        "fd1364a3-0895-4f1c-9fed-2c178b74c4ad": "The carbon (C) in the soil is mainly stored as soil organic matter (SOM), which is about 2.3 times greater than the C in atmospheric CO 2 and 3.5 times greater that the C in all terrestrial plants (Lal 2004;Schleuss et al. 2014). As an important terrestrial carbon sink, forest ecosystems cover an area of approximately 4 billion hectares worldwide and store approximately 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) (Batjes 1996;Six et al. 2002;Carvalhais et al. 2014). Afforestation, forest planting in areas that previously were not classified as forests, is seen as an effective method of controlling climate change and increasing soil carbon sinks, and it is also an important means of reducing the pressure on existing forests (Wolfe et al. 2015;Pugh et al. 2019). However, due to the limitations of planting costs and survival rates and the demands of human beings, artificial afforestation is mostly conducted as monocultures (Richards et al. 2010;Chomel et al. 2014). Although monoculture plantations have been well-recorded in forest studies, in the face of increasing climate change and ecological degradation, there is an increasing interest in mixedspecies plantations (Hulvey et al. 2013;Metz et al. 2016). Previous studies have shown that in addition to improving the productivity and stability of forest ecosystem, mixed species are more resilient and more resistant to biotic stresses (Zhang et al. 2012;Pretzsch and Schutze 2016). However, mixed-species plantations can potentially affect the chemical, physical, and biological processes of soil ecosystems as a consequence of changes in diverse stands and tree species composition (Coll et al. 2018;Liu et al. 2018). Especially for the SOC stocks, diverse stands will alter the balance between the input and loss of C by affecting the litterfall and rhizodeposition of plants and the structure of soil microbial communities (Wang et al. 2013;Prommer et al.",

As a result, it is still controversial that whether mixed-species plantations will more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks than monoculture plantations. Therefore, improving the understanding of how mixedspecies plantations affect the SOC stocks will have an important impact on the development of forest-based carbon offsets and policies. In general, mixed-species plantation is the system that composed of woody vegetation of multiple genotypes, species, structures and functions, and it can be arranged with variations in species composition, spatial arrangement and age structure (Griess and Knoke 2011;Manson et al. 2013;Liu et al. 2018). Ecological theories suggest that multispecies assemblages often show large differences in ecological strategies to cope with environmental changes (Richards et al. 2010;Mina et al. 2018). Some previous studies have also reported conflicting findings about the relationship between the SOC stocks and plant diversity (Diaz et al. 2009;McKinley et al. 2011;Yang et al. 2019). One view showed that mixed-species plantations were more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks than monoculture plantations. In particular, mixedspecies plantations can reduce competition for limited resources due to niche separation, thereby strengthening the carbon sequestration capacity of the region (Chomel et al. 2014;Liu et al. 2018). For example, mixed-species plantations can be used to stratify resources uptake (light, water, and nutrients) by adjusting crown width and tree height, thereby promoting the growth of vegetation and understory herbs and increasing the source of SOC (Forrester et al. 2006;le Maire et al. 2013). In addition, mixed-species plantations can provide a variety of habitats, thereby increasing the diversity of animals and microorganisms in the forest and the SOC cycle (Kooch et al. 2017).",
        "32099db4-8885-46cf-b94c-e9efff50f3be": "2017). A contrasting ecological hypothesis showed that multispecies forests tend to occupy overlapping niches, leading to increased competition, which directly leads to more consumption of SOC than monoculture plantations (Manson et al. 2013). In addition, as many studies have demonstrated, the SOC stocks is also affected by many biotic and abiotic factors, such as vegetation type, planting age, climate, soil qualities and prior land use/land cover (Davidson and Janssens 2006;Berthrong et al. 2009;Doetterl et al. 2015). However, it is unclear that the potential differences of those factors between mixed-species plantations and monoculture plantations. Overall, due to the diversity of driving factors and complex plant-soil feedback mechanisms, it is still unknown whether mixed-species plantations will more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks than monoculture plantations. Due to steep topography, frequent heavy rainfall in summer months, sparse vegetation cover, and improper land use, the Loess Plateau of China, with an area of 6.4 \u00d7 10 5 km 2 , is considered one of the most severe soil and water losses areas in the world (Liu et al. 2007;Gao et al., 2016). To control soil erosion and increase vegetation coverage, a series of nationwide conservation projects focusing on soil and water conservation have been launched since the 1980s, such as the \"Grain for Green\" Program, which aims to restore degradation lands (e.g., cropland and bare land) to forest, shrub land and grassland (Chang et al. 2014;Yuan et al. 2014). Over the past two decades, the vegetation coverage of the Loess Plateau has increased from 31.6% in 1999 to 59.6% in 2013, and the amount of sediment entering the sea from the Loess Plateau in 2015 was only 8.9% of that in the 1950s (Chen et al., 2015;Li et al., 2019).",
        "165ef9cb-ae59-4bbf-bccd-5db700be448f": "However, most of the plantations are established with fast-growing tree species (e.g., Pinus tabulaeformis) and exotic species (e.g., Robinia pseudoacacia), which will usually have a negative impact on the ecosystem stability (Cao et al. 2011;Brockerhoff et al. 2013). Especially for the Loess Plateau, duo to limited rainfall and high evaporation from soil, large-scale afforestation operations will directly affect the balance between regional water supply and demand, which results in longterm soil water deficit and forest degradation (Cao 2011;Jia et al. 2017). Due to better stand structure and community characteristics of mixed-species plantations lead to more advantages in controlling soil erosion and alleviating water stress compared with that of monoculture plantations, mixedspecies plantations are also widely cultivated in the Loess Plateau (Liang et al. 2012;Gong et al. 2020). Although previous researches have shown that afforestation programs on the Loess Plateau may indeed increase the SOC stocks (Chen et al. 2007;Deng et al. 2014), whether mixed-species plantations are more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks and stability than monoculture plantations on the Loess Plateau remains controversial (Wang et al. 2012;Gao et al. 2018). Furthermore, for the Loess Plateau, although factors affecting the SOC stocks after afforestation have been studied (Liu et al. 2011;Deng et al. 2014), how these factors regulate differences in the SOC stocks between different afforestation modes remains unknown. Therefore, we extracted from the published papers for a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of different afforestation modes (mixed-species plantations and monoculture plantations) on the SOC stocks in the Loess Plateau of China.",

By comparing the changes in the SOC stocks between monoculture plantations and mixed-species plantations, we found that the response size of SOC stocks of mixed-species plantations was significantly higher than that of monoculture plantations (Fig. 2). This result supports our hypothesis. Several possible mechanisms may underlie this result. First, aboveground leaf litter and belowground roots are the main source of organic matter input into the soil (Laganiere et al. 2010;Zhao et al. 2015). Mixed-species plantations with high species diversity and stand structure diversity can increase the amount and variety of litter (Hooper et al. 2012;Pretzsch and Schutze 2016), the root turnover, and the root exudates (Lei et al. 2012;Brassard et al. 2013), thereby resulting in higher accumulation of SOC stocks than monoculture plantations. Second, properties of microbes in soil may also alter SOC cycling and storage (Waring et al. 2013;Cheng et al. 2018). Mixed-species plantations usually have higher plant productivity and amounts of plant residue inputs than monoculture plantations (Pretzsch and Schutze 2016), which enhance the SOC stocks by increasing amounts of microbial biomass and necro-mass (Liang et al. 2011). Furthermore, fungal hyphae, microbes and plant roots can promote the development and stability of soil aggregates through the production of exudates, secondary metabolites and organic inputs, thus provided physical protection for SOC (Deng et al. 2018;Zhu et al. 2018). Some studies have found that the number of macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm) of soil in mixed-species plantations was higher than that in monoculture plantations (Shrestha et al. 2007;Kooch and Bayranvand 2017).",
        "2f77cba5-32e0-4740-9f0f-c24fb3d6f2f8": "2007;Kooch and Bayranvand 2017). Especially for the Loess Plateau, positive changes in macroaggregates could reduce the loss of SOM caused by soil erosion, thereby promoting the accumulation of SOC (Gao et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2019). Various combinations of different vegetation species have large differences in the SOC stocks. In this study, we found that the response size of SOC stocks was highest in the case of tree-shrub mixtures (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the results of previous studies (Zhang and Chen 2007;England et al. 2016). This phenomenon probably because of the differences in rotation periods and niche of trees and shrubs and thus a larger input of organic matter and the positive below-ground interaction (Kahmen et al. 2006;Gao et al. 2018). For the Loess Plateau, soil moisture often has constraint effects on the soil carbon sequestration (Lu et al. 2014;Wang et al. 2017). Gong et al. (2020) showed that mixedspecies plantations, especially the tree-shrub mixtures are more able to maintain soil moisture than monoculture plantations, which will improve the growth of vegetation to a certain extent and increase the SOC stocks. In addition, this phenomenon may be due to the shrubs on the Loess Plateau are mostly nitrogen-fixing vegetation (e.g., Hippophae rhamnoides), the increase of STN content will increase the SOC stocks to some extent (Fig. 6) (Pereira et al. 2011;Luo et al. 2016).",

Significant research has been undertaken over the past 20 years relating to litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Studies have shown that litter accumulates rapidly in restored areas (1-4 ton ha 21 yr 21 ) and the accumulated litter tends to be richer in nitrogen due to intentionally elevated densities of nitrogen-fixing species. This leads to a lower (carbon:nitrogen) C:N ratio (60:1 compared to 130:1 in unmined forest) that may promote mineralization of organic N to inorganic forms in restored areas. The major nutrient store in the unmined forest is in the soil and returning soil during the restoration process largely conserves this resource, particularly in relation to P. Short-term plant macronutrient requirements for growth are readily restored by fertilizer application. Studies on the reaccumulation of nutrient pools in the successional development of restored areas have shown that pools equivalent to the unmined forest are established within 10-20 years. Ongoing research is focusing on the rates of cycling processes in burnt and unburnt restored areas, and comparing these to the unmined forest to ensure that key functions have been reestablished.

Climatic factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature, evaporation) ultimately control ecosystem function in Australia (Specht & Specht 1999). Although these climatic influences are largely uncontrollable, it is important that mining and restoration activities do not create barriers to ecosystem function. There is an essential link between nutrient cycling processes and ecosystem sustainability. Although in the short term fertilizers can be applied to restored areas, in the long term the demand for nutrients must be met principally from nutrient cycling supplemented by inputs in rainfall, dry deposition, rock weathering, and, for nitrogen, by biological fixation of atmospheric N. The nutrient status of the Jarrah forest is lower than that of most other Australian eucalypt forests and other forests elsewhere (Hingston et al. 1981). The lateritic soils are particularly deficient in nutrients and the proportion of the total nutrients in the ecosystem that are incorpo-rated in the plants and litter is high when compared with other Australian eucalypt forests. To be sustainable and to reach a productivity level equivalent to the pre-mining forest, restored bauxite mines must accumulate sufficient nutrient capital and efficient nutrient cycles must be established. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the nutrients of most interest because N is the nutrient most limiting the growth of trees in the Jarrah forest (Abbott & Loneragan 1986) and responses in tree growth have been found to both N and P on restored areas (Ward & Koch 1995;Koch & Ward 2005).

Forest ecosystems are critical to global terrestrial carbon cycling and storage. Human activities and/or natural events, such as land management (Houghton 2003;Hunter 2001), air pollution (Canadell et al. 2007a), insect attacks (Kurz and Apps 1999), N deposition (Vetter et al. 2005), and climate change, have a noticeable effect on carbon storage. The net balance of carbon exchange, due to combinations of events and activities, has resulted in forests acting as either carbon sources or carbon sinks (Noble and Dirzo 1997;Wang et al. 2007). Assessing carbon storage at large scales, either global, national and/or regional, has been a focus on carbon cycling for the past several decades (Brown and Lugo 1982;Fang et al. 2001;Zhang et al. 2012). Consequently, estimating the spatial and temporal variations in carbon storage has been considered of great importance for understanding the impacts of climate change and human activities (King et al. 1997;Ni 2001;Parks and Bernier 2010;Zaehle et al. 2007).

To achieve this target, China has launched a series of nationwide afforestation and reforestation projects. Such approaches are inextricably linked to the evaluation of carbon storage and flux. Species and stand age structure, inevitably, are the prominent determinants of timber production and carbon storage (Garcia-Gonzalo et al.",

Furthermore, stand age can provide clues about past disturbances while aiding assessment of carbon storage dynamics (Hicke et al. 2007). Due to intensive deforestation and reforestation over the last century, stand age structure has been significantly modified in China, especially in the western region. Therefore, successive inventories of the forest resources can provide a scientific basis for assessing the vegetation carbon storage and possible drivers affecting the dynamics of carbon storage (Ren et al. 2011;Shi et al. 2011). Since China is one of the largest countries with a wide north-south gradient in temperature and a west-east gradient in precipitation, ecosystem carbon storage can be studied on either large-or small-scale climatic and geographic units (Hou 1983;Wang et al. 2007). China contains diverse ecosystems, including all major forest types of the northern hemisphere, from boreal forests in the north to evergreen tropical forests in the south (Hou 1983;Houghton and Hackler 2003;Li 2004). Forest inventory data (FID) in China is a valuable tool in monitoring the macro-changes of forest resources and biomass, as it includes natural and anthropogenic impacts on forests at regional and national levels, and has been conducted every 5 years for more than 30 years. The inventory is carried out by specially-designed standards formulated by the State Forestry Administration, focusing on the area and volume of each forest stand type (Lei et al. 2009;Liu and Cossalter 2006). Gansu Province in northwest China covers about 4.7 % of the country, ranking it the 7th largest of 34 administrative divisions of China. Compared with the eastern and southern regions, Gansu is ecologically fragile with large areas of arid and semiarid land.",

Forest cover has been increasing due to implementation of national projects, such as the ''Natural Forest Protection'' and ''Grain-for-Green'' (converting cropland to forest or grassland). During the past 3 decades, forest area and volume in Gansu Province have increased by 31.39 and 17.15 %, respectively. Although plantations contribute only a small fraction to global forest carbon (1.4 9 10 8 ha of current forests, 3.8 % of the total (FAO 2006)) their potential capacity for accumulating carbon and mitigating climate change in the future has been recognized (Canadell et al. 2007b;Pregitzer and Euskirchen 2004). Therefore, an assessment of carbon dynamics is urgently needed for properly evaluating and predicting present and future capacity for carbon sequestration in forests of each region (Chen et al. 2009). Since forest area has been increasing in the province, we hypothesized that forest carbon storage also increased. Given that forest age is an important determinant of carbon density (Pan et al. 2004;Xu et al. 2010), we predicted that forest age structure strongly affect the changing trend of carbon density and storage. Based on multiple FID from 1979 to 2006, we aimed to estimate the status of carbon storage and density and their dynamic changes within Gansu Province, to quantify the dynamics of carbon allocation in both natural forests and plantations, and to determine the effect of forest type, forest age, and forest origin on forest carbon density.",

Meanwhile, carbon density in Gansu was higher than the nation-wide average (Fang et al. 2001), which can be attributed to the large proportion of subalpine coniferous forests with high biomass.",

China has more plantations than any other country as a consequence of massive afforestation efforts. We use data from China to comparatively examine tree biomass and productivity of planted and natural stands in relation to climate zone, latitude, elevation, age and species diversity (richness).Location Six forest climate/vegetation zones in China.\nMethodsWe used a database completed in 2007 and then updated in 2013 that contained extensive records of forest stands (10 m \u00d7 10 m plots) across China. The database records included a total of 6153 forest stands (1716 planted forests aged 0-80 years and 4437 natural forests of aged 0-400 years), located from 18.1 to 53.2\u00b0N and 75.53 to 131.8\u00b0E, and between elevations of 7 and 4240 m above sea level. These forests were grouped into six climate zones for comparisons.\nResultsUnder generally similar physical conditions (climate zones) to those in natural forests and despite having low diversity (i.e. often a single tree species), plantations aged 0-80 years already had similar biomass but much higher productivity, and thus much higher carbon sequestration rates, than natural forests. Tree biomass, productivity and their above/below ground ratios showed stronger latitudinal and elevational trends in natural forests than in planted forests. No difference in productivity was observed between the planted forests with one or two species; in natural forests, however, high diversity usually led to high productivity.\nMain conclusionsThe differences in performance between planted and natural forests were mainly explained by: (1) age (the plantations were in early succession), (2) elevation (plantations were located at lower elevations), and (3) species selection (only highly productive species were planted). As the plantations were all still young, closer monitoring of their performance is needed.",
        "b4e3a605-c5f6-4c6e-9202-eb262104bdc5": "Ecologists generally accept that biodiversity can enhance productivity, stability and other ecosystem functions (Loreau et al., 2002). In addition to being affected by biodiversity, ecosystem characteristics may also be greatly affected by species composition (or identity) related to traits (e.g. Huston, 1997) and evenness (Polley et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2012). New studies, on the other hand, show that the relative importance of these factors might also depend on ecosystem type and successional stage (Laughlin & Moore, 2009;Doherty et al., 2011). Various other factors such as geographical context (e.g. setting) and associated physical/ecological conditions may also play highly variable but significant roles (e.g. Grace et al., 2007;Ma et al., 2010). Over the past few decades, ecosystem functioning has mostly been studied using experiments in grasslands/greenhouses (plants) or microcosms in which species number, population density and abiotic factors are controlled (Hooper et al., 2005). In other words, in almost all such experiments the purpose is to identify the effect of biodiversity (richness and evenness) on productivity and the contribution of physical factors is not the focus. Observations and inferences from natural settings have also occasionally been reported (Griffin et al., 2009;Jiang et al., 2009;Paquette & Messier, 2011;Zhang et al., 2012;Ruiz-Benito et al., 2014). Positioned between these two 'extreme' cases of highly controlled and uncontrolled systems are forest plantations. World-wide restoration efforts have resulted in the establishment of many forest plantations in which some variables (e.g. species, density) are at least partially controlled and others are not. While natural forests have been studied extensively with regard to aspects other than those directly linked to diversityfunction relationships, these plantations have perhaps been underappreciated as research sites for determining how biodiversity and other factors influence ecosystem functions.",
        "e5cbe5e1-ab2f-4fd1-8080-1a1870f2be21": "Forest plantations differ from plantings in standard biodiversity experiments or in natural systems in several ways (Scherer-Lorenzen et al., 2005). For example, plantations in which only species and density are initially manipulated are intermediate in terms of controlled (experiments) and uncontrolled (natural forests) variables. Habitat heterogeneity is seldom a factor in standard biodiversity experiments but is a factor in forest plantations, although to a lesser degree than in natural settings because plantations are often located in defined landscape units (e.g. in an old field, a clear cutting, or burned area) within which environmental conditions are relatively homogeneous. Also, unlike grassland or microcosm biodiversity experiments, in which the range in species number is typically large (e.g. 1-16 or 1-32 species; Hooper et al., 2005;Spehn et al., 2005) and species are randomly chosen from a species pool, forest plantations use very few species (often only one) at one time (Lugo, 1992) and the species are usually carefully chosen to be fit for high productivity. Forest plantations also differ from natural forests with natural successional processes, in that the history of species assemblage is determined at least initially by forest managers (Fig. 1; Ren et al., 2012). Because of these features, plantations offer some unique opportunities for us to simultaneously address the roles of biotic (i.e. richness, species identity/composition, density, age) and abiotic factors (e.g. latitude, elevation and climate) in biomass and productivity that either well-controlled experiments or natural forests could not. As a consequence of ongoing afforestation efforts, China now has more forest plantations than any other country, constituting c. 25% of the world-wide plantation area (del Lungo et al., 2006). The land area with forest plantations in China has increased from 4. 5% in 19645% in to 33.8% in 20035% in (Fang et al., 1996;;Guo et al., 2013). Hui et al.",

(2012) investigated biomassproductivity relationships using the database developed in China in which data from natural and planted forests are pooled. Here, using the extensive data from plantations in China, we compare the following properties of plantations and natural forests: leaf area index (LAI), density, biomass and productivity of tree species. We then investigate how these properties are related to age (succession), tree richness versus species identity, and other possible factors such as climate, latitude and elevation. Finally, we consider the implications of our results for future restoration efforts. We hypothesize that planted forests will exhibit fundamental differences in community property and performance from natural forests, mainly due to human selection of site, species and planting density. We believe that comparing the two types of forests, especially those of the same age, could offer new insights regarding forest performance such as productivity and carbon sequestration rate (especially for plantations; Lugo, 1992).",

Q. Guo and H. Ren world ecosystems. They offer a novel alternative to typical and traditional experimental approaches used in grasslands and greenhouses. Unlike natural forests, in which species join the community naturally and no factor is controlled, species and tree densities in planted forests are usually carefully selected but without further manipulation such as fertilization, addition of water or artificial thinning. Our study demonstrates that there is much to learn from the forest plantations where species number, identity, composition and abundance are controlled, while some degree of heterogeneity is maintained or uncontrolled (Lugo, 1992(Lugo, , 1997)). One of the most striking results in our study is that plantations had much higher productivity than natural forests across all climate zones, while biomass was similar (Fig. 2).

Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aquaculture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78 \u00b1 3.87 Mg OC ha \u00c01 and 12.67 \u00b1 0.14 Mg OC ha \u00c01 , respectively.

This unique condition, combined with their high productivity (218 \u00b1 72 Tg C y \u00c01 ; Bouillon et al., 2008), induces a high ability of this ecosystem in fixing and storing CO 2 , one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Carbon is assimilated and stored, both in aboveground and belowground biomass (stems, branches, leaves and roots) but also in their soils, with up to 90% of carbon stocks stored as soil organic matter (Donato et al., 2011;Stringer et al., 2015). Breithaupt et al. (2012) suggested that up to 15% of mangrove productivity can be buried, the remaining being decomposed or exported towards adjacent ecosystems through tidal flushing or tidal pumping (Maher et al., 2013;Leopold et al., 2015Leopold et al., , 2016)). Although mangroves occupy only $0.5% of global coastal ocean area (Giri et al., 2011), they account for approximately 10-15% of the total carbon sequestration of this area (Alongi, 2014). As a consequence, mangrove environments are sites for intense carbon processing with potential high impact on the global carbon cycle (Alongi, 2009). In Viet Nam, mangrove forest area was estimated at more than 400,000 hectares in 1943 (Maurand, 1943). However, their area dropped sharply over the past 70 years to 131,520 hectares in 2016 (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 2016) due to the aftermath of the destructive war and the excessive exploitation of forests. In the northern parts of Viet Nam, 17,094 hectares of mangroves had been lost throughout the period of 1964-1997.",

Since 1994, over 5600 hectares of mangrove forests have been planted in the Red River Mouth (including Thai Binh and Nam Dinh Provinces) by the Viet Nam Red Cross with the support of the Danish and the Japanese Red Cross through International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC, 2010). These planted forests are currently growing well and serve as a ''green wall\" against sea waves, reducing the risk of a sea dike break and providing substitute livelihoods as well as increasing available aquatic resources for fishing. Besides those effective benefits, mangroves are now regarded not only as sinks for sediments and nutrients, but also as a sink for CO 2 . Studies on carbon accumulation in mangroves in northern Viet Nam were carried out in young mangrove plantations, <10 years old (Ha et al., 2004;Cuc et al., 2009). However, there is a lack of data concerning stocks and burial rates for mature planted mangroves. The objectives of this study were, thus, to determine the carbon stocks in the substrate of a mature planted Kandelia obovata1 (Sheue, Lui & Yong) forest of 18 years old, both in the roots and in the soil, and to compare with the results obtained for the younger mangroves (Ha et al., 2004;Cuc et al., 2009). Our hypothesis is that carbon stocks in soils will increase with the age of the forest as observed for young planted mangroves (Ha et al., 2004;Cuc et al., 2009) and for mature monospecific pristine mangroves in French Guiana (Marchand, 2017). Marchand (2017) showed that even if the productivity of mature forests asymptotes, organic carbon continues to accumulate in soils over time.",

Land-use change (especially deforestation) has been historically responsible for a large part of the cu-mulative human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IPCC 2007). Considerable political and socio-economic attention is now focused on understanding and predicting the effects of the coupling between human activities, the biosphere carbon (C) cycle and predicted climate change (Ostle et al. 2009). This coincides with growing scientific evidence that continued atmospheric warming could have important feedbacks on the land's emission and consumption of biogenic greenhouse gas including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) (IPCC 2007). Society and human activities at national and local levels might play a key role in determining GHG feedbacks. In particular, land use and land use change can have significant direct and indirect effects on vegetation cover and soil C stocks by altering the balance between C sequestration and C losses (Ostle et al. 2009). Forests and agricultural lands may play an important role in the overall strategy for slowing the atmospheric accumulation of GHG (Ovando & Caparros 2009). Changes in vegetation and soil C stocks can occur naturally as ecosystems develop, mature and degrade (Ostle et al. 2009). On the other hand, land-use change is also associated with changes in land cover and C stocks (Bolin & Sukumar 2000). Each soil has an equilibrium C storage potential that is determined by the nature of vegetation, climatic conditions, and physicochemical properties of the soil (Six et al. 2002). An equilibrium in soil organic C (SOC) storage results from a balance between inputs and outputs of C (Fearnside & Barbosa 1998). This equilibrium can be perturbed by land-use change until a new equilibrium is reached in the altered ecosystem.",
        "8dc04ba4-9e28-4400-bdb3-c4920400fc31": "During this process, the soil can act either as a C source or sink, depending on the interaction between land-use, cropping systems, and management practices (Lal 2003;Singh & Lal 2005). The conversion of forest lands to agriculture, as an example, invariably results in the release of large quantities of CO 2 into the atmosphere and rapid decline of SOC stocks (Salinger 2007). Several reviews estimated that loss of soil C after cultivation of native soil ranges from 20-50% (Post & Kwon 2000;Guo & Gifford 2002;Murty et al. 2002;Gregorich et al. 2005). Land that has been depleted of soil C due to land-use change, however, can be a sink for CO 2 if we can utilize land-use conversion (such as afforestation, reforestation, and restoration of cultivated, abandoned and marginal soils) and management prac-tices to increase SOC storage (Silver et al. 2000). Establishment of large-scale short-rotation woody crop plantations has been advocated as an effective method for sequestering CO 2 and mitigating increased atmospheric CO 2 levels (Silver et al. 2000), through increasing long-term C storage in woody biomass (Schimel et al. 2000) and in the soil (Tolbert et al. 2000;Garten 2002), and by providing an alternative source of biomass for bioenergy (Tolbert et al. 2000;Arevalo et al. 2009). However, previous studies on C changes under short-rotation woody crops have been focused on C accumulation in aboveground biomass and/or bulk soil and much remains to be learned on the impact of woody crop plantations on ecosystem C dynamics, particularly in terms of how biomass and soil C storage change with land-use change, and there is much to understand about the effects of land-use change on C stocks.",

In Iran the coverage of regional forests has declined with the expansion of arable land and population growth, economic development, technological advancement, and change in social and political situations (Emadodin 2008). These forests have been reduced from 19 million hectares in the 1950s to 12.4 million hectares in the 1990s (DOE 2003). Over the last 50 years, the area of Iran's farmlands has grown by more than nine times, increasing from 2.6 million hectares to 24.5 million hectares (DOE 2003). Although improvement in the agricultural sector increased productivity greatly during the last 50 years, intensive farming and mismanagement of the deforested areas brought environmental problems and soil impacts such as soil erosion, acidification, soil compaction and pollution (Bahrami et al. 2010). Land-use changes in Iran have been more rapid in the last 50 years than at any time in Iran's history and are expected to continue at this rate or accelerate in the future (Emadodin 2008). Increase in population and a continuous decline in the area of farmland have led to indiscriminate exploitation of natural forests and fragile lands for agriculture: depletion of soil organic C and nutrients, however, are among the major forms of soil degradation (Khormali et al. 2009;Mojiri et al. 2011). The impact of such land-use change in reducing potential for C storage in woody biomass is also a major concern.

Results show that, while the autocompaction of minestones quickly raises soil densities to levels hostile to plant growth, forestation helps moderate soil densities. Weathering concentrates metals in minestones, but 14 years of forestation reduced the loadings of five metals by 35-52%.

Society decides both the timescales and the responsibilities of mining agencies and the balance struck between the miners' profits, the law, national needs, and the present or the future needs of society and/or the environment. It also decides the status of land reclamation and whether this is considered integral to mining or an (optional) \"after thought\" and whether it is conceived as a single action or an ongoing process. Certainly, in today's legislative environments, it is becoming more difficult for miners to walk away from the aftermath of their mining, especially where the landscape includes so much. Those responsible for unreclaimed or poor quality \"reclaimed\" land, increasingly, are named, shamed, and used as evidence against their industry and in support of arguments against granting planning permits for further opencast mining, as finally realised, nationally, in Wales in 2018 [3][4][5].

The expectation is that, in time, this new ecosystem will supersede the artificial plantings that were needed, initially, to reverse previous environmental decline. The \"Cradle for Nature\" trees are planted as temporary biomass accumulators designed to improve local habitat conditions and nurture the development of the depleted geoecological system toward autonomous self-sustainability [2].

        "3719a9e9-21a7-42f3-8f36-ccc2df9f82bc": "The \"Cradle for Nature\" strategy [2], which these studies evaluate, is an attempt to reinstate a self-sustaining and self-improving geoecological system on land that is suffering degradation-in this case, because of the progressive failure of land reclaimed after surface coalmining [6]. In standard ecological theory, the restoration of a self-sustaining geoecological system on degraded land should result in a series of well-recognised changes in structure, composition and functioning. These changes are summarised on Table 6 along with evidence gleaned from the Varteg test plots. Inevitably, it has not proved possible to measure, let alone monitor, all aspects of the geoecological system and some of the evidence from the Varteg must be inferred. To date, major omissions include insect life, which is an important part of a developing food web, although casual observation indicates that the new woodlands support the larval stages of a host of insects and that the mosaic of woodland, scrub and open grassland created on site through the strategy of annual planting provides a much greater range of niches than the unplanted grassland. Similarly, data on the soil macro fauna are limited to earthworms and while preliminary studies of bryophyte succession have been undertaken on site, these results are not yet available. Soil compaction and autocompaction through accelerated weathering have created a very hostile rooting environment in the substrates of most former opencast lands in Wales [68]. Soil densities below 10 or 15 cm often rise to levels close to or beyond the critical threshold for root penetration, often 1.6-1.8 g\u2022cm 3 , where soil pore sizes are reduced to levels too small for root-hair penetration [17]. Of course, some root penetration still occurs along macro-pores and fissures. At Varteg, tree growth in loosened ground maintains lower soil densities and increased soil moisture content.",
        "927fcc34-aeaa-4d45-94c8-208f129de7bc": "In other contexts, this tends to drop sharply to <10% in samples collected below 15-20 cm, where soil density rises above 1.6 g\u2022cm 3 [68]. Forestation and soil loosening also improve the earthworm habitat and earthworm biomass, which in trench-planted and pit-planted areas was >3.5 times greater than in notch-planted areas [16]. In other plantations, the earthworm biomass of both within-trench and adjacent out-of-trench samples was far greater than in samples collected from unplanted grassed control areas (Table 3). Despite some contamination hotspots [25], these opencast coal mine spoils have borderline levels of soil contamination and very low soil fertility. Natural weathering tends to enrich some of these metal contaminants, potentially raising contamination levels above recognised thresholds [28]. However, Desai's tests of a forestation chronosequence show that as trees grow, the loading of five soil metal contaminants declines very substantially, partly due to uptake into the tree's tissues and partly by mobilisation into leachate and runoff, where any potential harm is dissipated by dilution [26,29]. With improving soil structure and larger soil pores, there is a larger habitat for the soil biological system, which is also capable of creating more pore space and reducing soil density through its own activities, notably the burrowing of earthworms [36]. On the Varteg, studies in 2010 found >35 times greater earthworm biomass under 7-year-old alders than neighbouring unmodified grassland. However, the earthworm biomass under these young alders was >12.5 times smaller than that collected under adjacent alders in 13-19 years older trench-planted plots [16]. There were also positive changes in the size and activity of the soil microbiological system. Tests comparing soils sampled from the same sites in 1998 and 2018 showed that the 2018 population of microbes was 11.8 to 14.7 times higher than in 1998.",
        "82358bc1-6617-46b5-b824-9db6c81e62de": "Further, in sites where the trees were given additional fertilizer on planting, the microbial count was up 2.9 times compared with samples taken from control areas. In 1998, non-spore-forming bacteria dominated the microflora (85%) but 20 years later had declined to 40%, similarly the proportion of micromycetes declined from 59% to <19%. Instead, in 2018, bacilli increased to 46% (from <7%) and actinomycetes 26% (from <10%) and were especially dominant in samples from sites where the trees had been planted with fertilizers [34]. Overall, the soil microbial system is active, increasing and maturing with increasing numbers of bacteria becoming involved in humification and the decomposition of organic materials [32,33]. During the processes of humification, two different scenarios are apparent: in test plots with organic fertilization, humic acids prevail over the fulvic acids, while in those receiving mineral fertilization, fulvic acids prevail over humic acids [33]. In general, records of the flora and fauna on site show similar trajectories. Whilst the diversity of micro and macrofauna within the soil has increased, the same cannot be said of the macroflora above ground. Results have shown the enormous changes which have taken place when trees are planted and develop, even over the short period of 20 years. A new and different habitat has been created including plants that are able to thrive in the shaded conditions under the tree canopy. However, survey results indicate that the most diverse flora is found where there is a mosaic of trees, scrub and open grassland. Here, the intention is to allow the trees to self-thin, as in natural woodland regeneration, and the selection of trees planted was designed with this in mind (Section 1.4). Recent records suggest that this process is underway and that high initial stocking density of 10,000 stems per hectare is slowly being reduced contributing, as the estimates of timber volume suggest, the considerable and continuing deposition of woody biomass on the woodland floor, thus hastening soil improvement.",
        "0cb31b1d-e624-42e1-9fbf-f456fe78b1ee": "Twenty years is a short time in the growth of a woodland, especially one planted piecemeal in harsh upland conditions [13,[16][17][18][19][20]69]. However, the system of annual plantings has created an unusually complex habitat mosaic of fenced and unprotected grassy patches, forest test plots, and scrub, much of it dominated by self-set hawthorn. The complex ecosystem associated with mature woodland has yet to become established. However, elsewhere, mosaic and shrub-land habitats have proved best for increasing, at least, songbird diversity on reclaimed coal lands [70]. Here, results from mammal surveys suggest increases in diversity, numbers, and the length of food chains, while the bird seed fall work, which also suggests increasing populations and ecosystem productivity, demonstrates how forestation has significantly increased seed fall and so accelerated recolonisation of the site by local tree species. The team is conscious that much more work remains to be done. Thus far, the role of topographic position on soil and vegetation properties has not been explored, although preliminary results suggest that it has no significant impact on tree growth [71,72]. More work is also needed on insect and other invertebrate biomass but the expansion of small mammal populations in the woodland areas suggests that there is an ample food supply. The State of Nature Report 2019 [73] shows that the rate of decline of the UK's biodiversity is yet to slow. Agricultural intensification continues, e.g., the area treated with pesticides increased by 53% between 1990 and 2010, and so has the growth of human population and its land-take. More land is required for amenity and recreation and also for wildlife. \"Rewilding\" more of the UK's vast areas of former coal land and similar brownfield sites could contribute greatly to providing more space for wildlife. In general, these low-quality and often unsightly lands have no economic use; they are unfit for either industrial/urban redevelopment or agriculture and, often, relatively distant from any modern release of pollutants, pesticides or fertilisers.",
        "b543000f-0038-4fd2-9aca-a3b4be79b022": "In South Wales, the systematic rewilding of these lands could create extensive corridors of semi-natural vegetation, a reservoir for wildlife of national importance, and land of enhanced amenity and recreational value. Already, the National Botanic Garden of Wales has launched a project called \"Grasslands for Life\", which aims to monitor grasslands, including those on coal lands, by soil DNA barcoding. The results from Varteg, however, show that forestation is possible even for opencast coal land declared unfit for tree growth, which is why the Varteg was restored in 1963 as grassland. However, mosaic planting that mixes trees, grassland and scrub, which provides a relatively large array of eco-niches, seems to be a more effective way of promoting maximum biodiversity than reliance on any single land use.",
        "189e2240-6cda-4d61-b52a-a7b1a3af4345": "For decades, mangrove forests have been under tremendous pressure due to deforestation and conversion. To sustainably manage the mangroves that remain, an ecosystem approach to management is essential. Two different management regimesconservation and restorationwere assessed, looking at their respective effects on forest structure and carbon cycling capacity, when compared with degraded mangrove. We found that mangrove restoration enhanced tree density, while mangrove conservation was able to maintain species diversity. In terms of carbon budgets, aboveground carbon was lower in restored mangrove (79.40 \u00b1 37.41 Mg C ha -1 ) when compared with conserved mangrove (92.26 \u00b1 22.65 Mg C ha -1 ), but was almost double that found in degraded mangrove (39.89 \u00b1 27.49 Mg C ha -1 ). Although conserved mangrove had higher aboveground carbon, lower amounts of soil carbon were found in conserved mangrove (127.49 \u00b1 33.21 Mg C ha -1 ) than in restored and degraded mangrove (236.26 \u00b1 20.33 Mg C ha -1 and 139.17 \u00b1 25.44 Mg C ha -1 , respectively). The elevation change was highest in degraded mangrove (41.7 \u00b1 24.0 mm yr -1 ), followed by restored (20.7 \u00b1 14.6 mm yr -1 ) and conserved mangrove (12.2 \u00b1 3.9 mm yr -1 ). Carbon burial in conserved mangrove (1.20 \u00b1 1.90 Mg C ha -2 yr -1 ) was double that of degraded mangrove (0.63 \u00b1 0.60 Mg C ha -2 yr -1 ). Ultimately, we conclude that although a conserved mangrove is not always the end result of mangrove restoration and sustainable management, finding balance between structural development and ecosystem function is essential to serve different objectives, including biodiversity maintenance.",
        "4fd24e1a-ef4e-45fc-91f0-027789a5417e": "Mangroves provide a diverse range of valuable ecosystem services, which include supporting services (e.g. nutrient cycling, net primary production and land formation), provisioning services (e.g. food, fuel and fiber products), and regulating services (e.g. protection from climate change, flooding, storm surges and pollution, and water purification) (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Together with seagrasses and salt marshes, mangrove forests represent the 'blue carbon' ecosystem, which has incredible biomass productivity and provides efficient long-term carbon sinks (Bouillon et al., 2008;Lovelock and Duarte, 2019). However, mangrove ecosystems across the world are under pressure from deforestation, degradation, and conversion. In Southeast Asia, the rate of loss of mangrove forests between 2000 and 2012 was reported as 0.18% per year (Richards and Friess, 2016). While, in Indonesia, mangrove area has declined at a rate of 1.24% per year, from 4.2 Mha in 1980 to 2.9 Mha in 2005 (FAO, 2007). The last estimates indicate that Indonesia's remaining mangrove area is approximately 3.1 Mha (Giri et al., 2011). The impacts of deforestation and degradation significantly reduce the carbon sink capacity of mangroves. Although mangrove loss counted for just 6% of Indonesia's total annual deforestation (Margono et al., 2014), this loss contributed to annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.07-0.21 Pg CO 2 e, equivalent to 10-31% of the total estimate for emissions from land-use sectors (Murdiyarso et al., 2015).",
        "5ccced0a-a567-4226-b1dc-a7f86691fefa": "Avoiding mangrove deforestation could make a significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions; mangroves hold as much as 1083 \u00b1 378 Mg C ha -1 of total ecosystem carbon stocks, which equates to carbon storage of 3.14 \u00b1 1.10 Pg C (Murdiyarso et al., 2015). Maintaining mangrove intact would equally allow the forest to enhance any carbon inputs that arise from organic carbon burial or other sources. Organic carbon that enters the mangrove ecosystem originates from two interrelated sources, allochthonous (e.g. tidal waves bringing marine inputs as well as fluvial sediment from upstream) and autochthonous (i.e. on-site biomass carbon input) (Adame et al., 2010). Globally, organic carbon burial rates range from 0.2 to 10.2 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 (Breithaupt et al., 2012). Organic carbon burial rates in Indonesia have been shown to be as much as 6.58 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 in Central Java (Kusumaningtyas et al., 2019), up to 2.20 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 in Bali (Sidik et al., 2019), around 17.22 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 in East Kalimantan (Kusumaningtyas et al., 2019), and up to 1.19 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 in West Papua (Sasmito et al., 2020a). The connectivity between forest structure, sedimentation and carbon burial in mangrove ecosystems has been reported, particularly because improvements to forest structure would facilitate carbon accumulation through sedimentation processes. A study conducted in Sydney Harbor mangrove showed that young mangrove tree roots recolonized and then facilitated soil volume expansion and mineral sedimentation to yield a small soil surface elevation increment of 2.9 mm yr -1 (Rogers et al., 2005).",
        "d4838e0b-6482-4ece-b516-ca3097b6ed88": "In addition, increased mangrove density promoted an increase to surface elevation in various ways, such as vertical accretion, retention of deposited sediments, and root growth (Huxham et al., 2010). Naturally, mangroves have self-recovering abilities if their morphological and hydrological features have not been changed or damaged (Martinuzzi et al., 2009). However, when disturbances occur, these abilities slowly degrade and/or disappear. A recent study in West Papua, Indonesia, indicated that aboveground biomass requires a minimum of 25 years to recover and reach the same levels of biomass carbon seen in undisturbed mangrove forest (Sasmito et al., 2020b). It is not known, however, to what extent human-induced restoration or rehabilitation efforts could enhance this recovery process, in terms of forest structure and functioning. Restoring degraded mangrove has the potential to improve the functioning of coastal forests and carbon stocks, but ensuring species diversity is often neglected. It is essential that the climate mitigation agenda, through mangrove restoration, aims at reversing biodiversity losses (Nellemann et al., 2009). Depending on the availability of plant materials, human-induced restoration has had a tendency to use mono-species, such as that found in the severely degraded mangroves of Segara Anakan Lagoon, Central Java, where Rhizophora apiculata was planted in the mudflat zone and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza was planted in harder substrate in the fringing and interior zones (Soemodihardjo et al., 1991). Although non-planted species have the chance to colonize the restored area, they are usually suppressed by any planted mono-species, as seen in Gazi Bay, Kenya (Kairo et al., 2001). This type of management practice does not encourage the natural regeneration that permits the retrieval of multiple species, as found in Cimanuk River Delta in West Java (Sukardjo et al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to understand the best management practice for sustainable mangrove management.",

We assessed a number of biophysical parameters related to forest structure, carbon dynamics and sedimentation processes, looking at mangroves under different management regimes (i.e. conservation and restoration), with the primary objective of comparing the results against mangroves in degraded conditions, which happen to dominate the coastal landscape in North Sumatra, Indonesia. We hypothesize that good management practices will improve forest structure and carbon stocks, as well as the sedimentation and carbon burial rates. It is expected that study findings can inform public policy making processes, particularly regarding restoration efforts and the use of blue carbon mangrove ecosystems as part of nature-based climate solutions.",

Mixed and pure plantations are common afforestation choices in north China, but how forest type and environmental factors interact to affect soil C stock remains unclear. We hypothesize that forest type changes soil physicochemical properties and surface biological factors, and further contributes to soil active C components, which together affect soil C sequestration capacity and C dynamic processes. Three 46-year-old 25 m \u00d7 25 m pure Pinus tabulaeformis forests (PF) and three 47-year-old 25 m \u00d7 25 m mixed coniferous-broadleaf (Pinus tabulaeformis-Quercus liaotungensis) forests (MF) were selected as the two treatments and sampled in August 2016. In 2017, soil temperature (ST) at 10 cm were measured every 30 min for the entire vegetation season. Across 0-50 cm (five soil layers, 10 cm per layer), we also measured C components and environmental factors which may affect soil C sequestration, including soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil moisture (SM) and soil pH. We then incubated samples for 56 days at 25 C to monitor the C loss through CO 2 release, characterized as cumulative mineralization carbon (CMC) and mineralized carbon (MC). Our results indicate that ST, pH, SM and litter thickness were affected by forest type. Average SOC stock in MF was 20% higher than in PF (MF: 11.29 kg m -2 ; PF: 13.52 kg m -2 ). Higher CMC under PF caused more soil C lost, and CMC increased 14.5% in PF (4.67 g kg -1 soil) compared to MF (4.04 g kg -1 soil) plots over the two-month incubation period.",

Half of the global forest C is stored in soils (Pan et al., 2011) with soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimated to be over three times the size of atmospheric stock and four times that of biotic stock (Lal, 2004). SOC stock in forests may influence atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and regulate the greenhouse effect (Amundson, 2001). In addition, the large soil reservoir is not permanent, but result from a dynamic equilibrium between organic and inorganic matter entering and leaving the soil (Souc\u00e9marianadin et al., 2018;Tian et al., 2016). Accurate determination of changes in SOC stocks and response analysis of dominant environmental factors are prerequisite to understand the role of soils in the global C cycling and to verify changes in stocks due to management. Afforestation has been the most influential human activity in altering forest ecosystem structure and function that has been implemented worldwide (IPCC, 2022). Forest management has received increasing attention because of its predictable effects on ecosystems, specifically through C sequestration (Fang et al., 2001;Richter et al., 1999). Research indicates that the C sequestration capacity of soil is influenced by forest management, which differs depending on tree species composition (Galka et al., 2014), forest stand age (Lucas-Borja et al., 2016), forest density (Ma et al., 2018;Segura et al., 2017) and other forest variables (Verkerk, de Arano & Palah\u00ed, 2018;Li et al., 2018;Chen & Shrestha, 2012).

The soil C dynamics of forests may be impacted by interacting environmental, and physical factors such as soil temperature (ST) (Uvarov, Tiunov & Scheu, 2006), soil moisture (SM) (Yoon et al., 2014), soil texture (Cai et al., 2016) and bulk density (Vos et al., 2005); chemical factors such as soil pH (Motavalli et al., 1995) and elemental nitrogen and phosphorus (Liu et al., 2015); and bioenvironmental factors such as plant diversity (Chen et al., 2018), tree age (Ma et al., 2018), litter (Tan & Chang, 2007) and root matter (Hertel & Leuschner, 2002). The species composition of the aboveground vegetation will affect the quantity and quality of surface litter and root exudates and the input processes of organic C source (Chen & Xu, 2008;Tan & Chang, 2007). ST, SM and pH can affect the export process of soil C, such as soil respiration, soil C transfer and loss (Uvarov, Tiunov & Scheu, 2006;Yoon et al., 2014). Simultaneously, Schrumpf et al. (2011) research shown that soil SOC stocks were calculated based on SOC concentrations, bulk densities, and the fine earth fractions, and in undisturbed forest soils with low stone contents, SOC concentrations contributed most to SOC stock variability. We should fully consider the climatic, land-use, and soil types of the study site, and then comprehensively select the formula for calculating soil SOC stock to further analyze the response mechanisms of dynamic process of C accumulation and loss to multiple environmental factors.",

Studies have shown that active characteristics make soil-activated C vulnerable to environmental factors (Zhang et al., 2015;Jiang et al., 2006), and active C can reflect small changes in SOC caused by management measures or climate change (Leifeld & K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2005), which plays an important role in soil C sequestration capacity and greenhouse gas emissions (Liang et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2009). DOC is an organic C source that can be directly used by soil microorganisms and is active in the physical movement and chemical transformation of soil (Chen et al., 2018). Meanwhile, DOC leaching is also an important mechanism of SOC loss (Oliveira et al., 2016). MBC is the most active component of SOC, revealing microbial activity and concentration in soil and is an important indicator for measuring soil fertility (Xu, Inubushi & Sakamoto, 2006). Above-ground vegetation type is generally considered to be an important factor affecting microbial activity (P\u00f6tzelsberger & Hasenauer, 2015). CMC is the amount of CO 2 released after SOC was mineralized into inorganic C in a certain of time (measured by g kg -1 release of CO 2 -C), and MC was the proportion of CO 2 -C content released by SOC mineralization to soil total organic C content in a certain period of time (%) (Sanford & Kucharik, 2013).",

The objectives of this study are three-fold: (i) to determine C stock and active components between PF and MF; (ii) to evaluate which forest type can maintain a better C sequestration strategy and (iii) to reveal the potential mechanism of C dynamics between the two forest types through variation in active C components and environmental factors.

However, the impacts of logging and active restoration, by liberation cutting and enrichment planting, on tree community composition are poorly understood compared to trajectories of biomass recovery. Here, we assess the long-term impacts of selective logging and active restoration for biomass recovery on tree species diversity, community composition, and forest structure. We censused all stems \u22652 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) on 46 permanent plots in unlogged, primary forest in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA; 12 plots, totalling 0.6 ha) and in sites logged 23-35 years prior to the census in the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve adjacent to DVCA (34 plots, totalling 1.7 ha) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Active restoration treatments, including enrichment planting and climber cutting, were implemented on 17 of the logged forest plots 12-24 years prior to the census. Total plot-level basal area and pole (5-10 cm DBH) stem density were lower in logged than unlogged forests, however no difference was found in stem density amongst saplings (2-5 cm DBH) or established trees (\u226510 cm DBH). Neither basal area, nor plot-level stem density varied with time since logging at any size class, although sapling and pole stem densities were lower in actively restored than naturally regenerating logged forest. Sapling species diversity was lower in logged than unlogged forest, however there were no other significant effects of logging on tree species richness or diversity indices. Tree species composition, however, differed between logged and unlogged forests across all stem size classes (PER-MANOVA), reflected by 23 significant indicator species that were only present in unlogged forest. PERMANOVA tests revealed no evidence that overall species composition changed with time since logging or with active restoration treatments at any size class. However, when naturally regenerating and actively restored communities were compared, two indicator species were identified in naturally regenerating forest and three in actively restored forests.",

In selectively logged forests, which account for 95% of the tropical timber harvest (Asner et al., 2009), the majority of trees remain standing, retaining residual reproductive adults that provide a source of propagules for natural recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. By contrast to clear-fell logging, whereby all stems are removed, selective logging aims to remove only ~4-15 stems per hectare and targets the largest trees (usually >40 cm diameter at breast height; DBH at c. 1.3 m) and the highest quality timber species (Pinard andPutz, 1996, Edwards et al., 2014). As such, selective harvesting performed with adequate care and at sufficiently long harvesting intervals may represent an acceptable middle-ground between high levels of timber extraction and strict protection (Meijaard, 2005, Berry et al., 2010, Putz et al., 2012, Edwards and Laurance, 2013). However, the impacts of logging on tree species diversity and community composition are still poorly understood. While selective logging is prevalent throughout the tropics, the island of Borneo alone has generated greater exports of timber than the African and American tropics combined (Cleary et al., 2007). These high extraction volumes reflect the abundance of valuable timber, particularly species in the family Dipterocarpaceae, combined with the rapid economic development of Malaysia after gaining independence in the second half of the 20th century (Brookfield and Byron, 1990). Forests in Borneo were first selectively logged in the early 1970s and have a projected interval of 40-60 years between harvests in production forests (Sist et al., 2003), although actual cutting cycles are frequently shorter (Reynolds et al., 2011).",

Given the extent of forest ecosystems affected by selective logging and the potential for this area to expand, it is critical that we understand the long-term impacts of selective logging and the capacity for forests to recover over time. Selectively logged forest has been demonstrated to provide valuable habitat for forest animals and migration corridors between areas of undisturbed forest (Edwards et al., 2011, Wearn et al., 2017). Indeed, in selectively logged forest, over half the total area is not directly disturbed by logging operations (Putz et al., 2019). There is widespread consensus that logged forests have a relatively high conservation potential for forest animals due to their functional similarity to unlogged forest habitat, although these habitats may not support all rare bird and mammal species (Meijaard, 2005, Wells et al., 2007, Edwards et al., 2011, Putz et al., 2012, Wearn et al., 2017). Research on plant communities in logged forests has shown that overall species richness and the abundance of most species tend to be resilient to the impacts of selective logging (Berry et al., 2010, Putz et al., 2012). However, shifts in the abundance of a few key species can drive notable reductions in biodiversity, as well as changes to community structure and the physical structure of the forest (Foody andCutler, 2003, Putz et al., 2012). These abundant species, as well as metrics of community composition, can be valuable indicators of degradation and the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation efforts (Imai et al., 2014, Fujiki et al., 2016).",
        "5324fd56-eab8-49b6-aa94-62c865ec2ceb": "In Borneo, logging reduces the density of large hardwoods, predominantly from the family Dipterocarpaceae, which are targeted for harvesting, and tends to increase the abundance and basal area of early successional pioneer species (Berry et al., 2008). In terms of forest structure and biomass recovery, it is estimated that above ground biomass takes approximately 60 years to recover in logged forest (Berry et al., 2010, Philipson et al., 2020), although below ground biomass may take substantially longer (Martin et al., 2013). In contrast, the recovery time needed for tree community composition to match an undisturbed reference state may take anywhere from 50 to several hundred years (Appanah et al., 1990, Foody and Cutler, 2003, Putz et al., 2012). This time frame is generally longer than the minimum harvesting interval projected for Borneo (Sist et al., 2003, Reynolds et al., 2011), suggesting that plant community effects may accumulate through repeated cycles of logging. Restoration strategies to mitigate the negative effects of timber extraction include rehabilitation-for-conservation and carbon capture mechanisms, and investment by the selective logging industry to enable shorter harvesting intervals by enhancing regeneration and growth of valuable stems (Fredericksen andPutz, 2003, Pe\u00f1a-Claros et al., 2008). Depending on which of these goals the restoration strategy targets, different actions may be taken (e.g. replanting a single valuable species for profit vs replanting a range of adversely affected native taxa for conservation), leading to distinct tree communities post-restoration. Most commonly, active restoration strategies employ a combination of enrichment planting, in which seedlings of valuable timber species are transplanted into logged forests (Kettle, 2010), and liberation thinning, which may involve cutting back stems of early successional species, and liana cutting, to increase light availability and allow target tree species to effectively compete for resources (van der Heijden et al., 2015, Marshall et al., 2017).",

Crouzeilles et al (2017) did not assess community composition trajectories however, nor provide regionspecific recovery estimates for richness and diversity, and long-term assessments of community recovery are still much needed. Trajectories of recovery in tree community composition and diversity over time have rarely been explored in selectively logged Southeast Asian forests. Typically, studies compare species assemblages at one or two discrete time points since logging with an unlogged comparison or pre-logging record of the tree community (Okuda et al., 2003, Bischoff et al., 2005, Berry et al., 2008). While these studies provide valuable insights to community recovery, they lack information on directional trends in changing community composition with time. Here we present data across a 12-year post-logging chronosequence in Bornean lowland dipterocarp forest to explore tree community richness, diversity, and composition of neighbouring plots 23-35 years after logging, which were either left to regenerate naturally or were subject to active restoration treatments. Where plots were actively restored for improved carbon uptake, we explore the ecological co-benefits to the tree community 12-24 years after treatment. Specifically, we address the following questions: 1. How does selective logging affect stem density, basal area, richness and diversity of tree species, and tree community composition when compared with neighbouring unlogged forest? 2. Does the trajectory of recovery over time for these metrics differ between selectively logged forests that regenerate naturally compared to those that were actively restored? We approach these questions for the tree community as a whole and at three distinct stem size classes (saplings 2-5 cm DBH, poles 5-10 cm DBH, and established trees DBH \u2265 10 cm) to understand how logging and restoration affect successional processes across tree life stages.",

Forest structure and community composition were both evidently affected by selective logging, despite little significant difference in richness or diversity. Total stem basal area and stem density were higher in unlogged forest than in naturally regenerating logged forest, driven by greater stem density in the pole size class. In logged forest, sapling and pole stem density increased with time since logging across the censused chronosequence for actively restored areas. By contrast, in naturally regenerating forest, stem density was greater but did not increase over time. Tree community composition was significantly different between unlogged and naturally regenerating logged forest, with unlogged forest exhibiting more variation among plots and having more indicator species than other treatments. In logged forest, there was no effect of active restoration (conducted 12-24 years pre-census) or time since logging on the overall community composition, however several individual species were indicators of the active restoration treatment. Together, our results suggest that the effects of selective logging on tree communities can still be observed 23-35 years after harvesting regardless of active restoration efforts.",

To evaluate the impacts of tree species compositions on the carbon storage capacity of plantation ecosystems, we measured the above and belowground biomass, as well as the carbon content, in three 27-year old forest plantations of monoculture Castanopsis hystrix (CH stand), monoculture Pinus massoniana (PM stand), and mixed C. hystrix and P. massoniana (mixed CH/PM stand) stands. We developed an allometric equation to estimate tree carbon storage. The carbon storage levels of understory, litter, and soil components were also estimated. Results show that biomass is positively correlated with carbon storage. The ecosystem carbon storage of the mixed CH/PM stand (327.03 Mg ha \u00c01 ) was higher than those of the CH (314.59 Mg ha \u00c01 ) and PM (293.60 Mg ha \u00c01 ) stands. The majority of carbon storage was found in the soil pool (84.73%, 63.54%, and 75.80% in the CH, PM and mixed CH/PM stands, respectively). Almost 40% of soil carbon at a depth of 0-60 cm was stored in the upper 20 cm of the soil pool. Except for the vegetation layer, each layer of the CH and mixed CH/PM stands consisted of a higher amount of carbon than did the layers of the PM stand. These findings suggest that mixed CH/PM plantation stands or valuable indigenous CH plantation stands more substantially improve carbon storage in litter, soil, and ecosystems than do monoculture PM plantation stands. The results also imply that developing valuable indigenous tree species is a good silvicultural option for enhancing carbon sequestration and valuable timber cultivation in subtropical China.",

Effective forest management not only avoids a decline in net sequestration, but also enhances sequestration (Birdsey et al., 2006;Pan et al., 2011;Zarin, 2012). The effects of tree species composition and stand age on the carbon storage in forest ecosystems should therefore be provided adequate attention (Grigal and Ohmann, 1992;Yang et al., 2005). Tree species composition is important for carbon storage in regions of the same climate range (Chen et al., 2011). The broadleaved species Michelia macclurei possesses greater carbon sequestration potential than does the coniferous species Cunninghamia lanceolata growing in southern China (Niu et al., 2009). A study on the moist tropical uplands of northeast Australia reveals that mixed-species timber plantations store more carbon than do monoculture native conifer plantations (Kanowski and Catterall, 2010). Forest age is a powerful predictor of carbon cycling (Magnani et al., 2007). Ecological modeling efforts suggest that modifications to management practices, specifically shifting to longer rotations of even-aged stands, can increase carbon stock over time (Balboa-Murias et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2012) found that biomass accumulation increases with stand age, and confirmed that forest management intensification and reforestation programs, especially those targeting Acacia or mixed Eucalyptus/ Acacia forests, enhances the potential for future carbon sequestration. However, the effect of forest management on carbon cycling was weak and, in some cases, not significant, implying the need of further research on its impact (Vayreda et al., 2012).

However, the large-scale and continuous development of monoculture coniferous and exotic broadleaved species, such as Eucalyptus (SFA, 2007), in China in the first decade of this century has caused severe ecological consequences (He et al., 2008). The increased demand for high-quality timber and ecological services has resulted in the cultivation of valuable indigenous broadleaved and mixed plantations (Seidl et al., 2007;Hvistendahl, 2012). Aiming to develop multipurpose forests that provide goodquality timber and ecological services, the Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry of the Chinese Academy of Forestry has carried out various forest management trials on Castanopsis hystrix, P. massoniana, and other valuable native species since the 1980s (Cai et al., 2007;Stone, 2009). Some scientists have recently studied the effects of different management strategies on growth and biomass allocation patterns (Guo et al., 2010;Niu et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2011). Thus far, only a few studies have examined the effects of different silviculture and forest management strategies on the carbon storage in C. hystrix or P. massoniana plantations. The main objective of this study was to compare the capacities of carbon stocks in three 27-year old plantation stands in subtropical China, and provide a management baseline for enhancing carbon sequestration and valuable timber cultivation in subtropical China. The comparison was made on the basis of similarities in topography, soil texture, stand age, and management history.

In southern China, while the introduced fast-growing Sonneratia apetala and native shrubby Kandelia obovata have been widely used in mangrove reforestation/afforestation programs since the mid-1980s, their implications and ecosystem services are still unclear. Here we show distinct differences in fine root dynamic among 12-year-old S. apetala, K. obovata monocultures, and their mixed stand using root coring, ingrowth core, and intact-core methods. Soil organic carbon storage was examined by soil coring method. One-year observation showed significant differences among the three mangrove plantations in fine root biomass, necromass, turnover rate, and decomposition decay rate constant. Soil organic carbon stock was 15.8 \u00b1 0.8, 7.8 \u00b1 0.5, and 11.9 \u00b1 1.6 Mg C ha -1 for K. obovata, S. apetala monocultures and their mixed stand, respectively. Live fine root biomass, fine root necromass, annual fine root production and fine root mass decay rate constant are significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content across plantations. We suggest that mangrove fine root dynamics were mainly affected by soil nutrient conditions and species composition. Mixed stands may not have higher soil organic carbon storage than monocultures. The functional trait of different mangrove species is responsible to determine the carbon storage function of mixed stands. Fine roots play an important role in carbon storage, and fine root dynamics have a significant effect on carbon sequestration in mangrove ecosystems.

Fine roots account for 10-30% of total forest tree biomass and 30-50% of total net primary production in global terrestrial ecosystem (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al., 2011;McCormack et al., 2015b). Consequently, fine root turnover represents a major pathway for carbon and nutrient fluxes from plants to soil (Dornbush et al., 2002). While inhabiting a relatively steady environment compared to their aboveground counterparts, fine roots dynamics are still influenced by internal and external moderators, e.g., the intensity of intraspecific competition (Wang D. et al., 2019), seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation (Ibrahim et al., 2020;Sun et al., 2020), nutrient availability (Wang W. J. et al., 2019), or species composition in the community (Caplan et al., 2019). These complex feedbacks pose significant challenges to understanding fine root dynamics and their implications for key ecosystem processes. Mangrove ecosystems are among the most productive and ecologically important ecosystems of the world (Li et al., 2019). Mangroves are vital blue carbon resource, with their soil carbon comprising more than 50% of the total C stock within the system (Adame et al., 2017). Mangrove plants are capable of allocating higher proportions of their total biomass to belowground roots in response to nutrient limitation and anoxic condition (Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al., 2011). Recent studies suggested that mangrove fine roots have a higher contribution to soil C than that of litterfall, and the positive effect on soil C accretion is attributable mainly to fine root production (Poungparn et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017;Xiong et al., 2017).",

S. apetala is a tall and fast-growing species, whereas K. obovata is a shrubby species that commonly forms forests with higher tree densities (He et al., 2018). More attention on the ecosystem services derivable from such afforestation programs, e.g., carbon sequestration, has been supposed for an improved approach to global mangrove restoration (Lee et al., 2019). S. apetala forests have been reported to demonstrate much higher soil carbon accumulation rates as well as higher belowground root biomass than those of the native species (Ren et al., 2009(Ren et al., , 2010)). However, studies of biomass and carbon allocation in tropical and subtropical mangrove ecosystems suggest that shrubby forests allocate relatively more biomass or carbon to roots than do tall mangroves under unfavorable environmental conditions (Lovelock, 2008;Casta\u00f1eda-Moya et al., 2011, 2013). In addition, Chen et al. (2012) reported that mixed mangrove plantations had higher soil carbon accumulation than the monocultures. Therefore, how soil carbon storage may differ based on contrasting morphological and functional traits of these two species, as well as the community setting, e.g., monocultures versus mixed plantation, would have significant implications for species selection and habitat management in carbon-based mangrove afforestation programs.

This study was conducted in stands of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

Rapid human population growth and increased pressures on natural resources over the last century have led to more native forests becoming degraded, with an asso-ciated decline in the ability of native forests to provide various ecosystem services (Millennial Ecosystem Assessment 2005). In contrast, the area of forest plantations has increased by >100 Mha globally since 1990, and consequently, forest plantations provide an expanding quantity of selected ecosystem services (Payn et al. 2015). Given the historical and ongoing trends in forest cover, coupled with the projected increase in demand for ecosystem services from forests, the role of plantation forests in providing a diversity of ecosystem services is likely to considerably increase in the future. In the 20th and 21st centuries, plantation forests of the European and Euro-American tradition have been primarily managed for provisioning wood fiber with the assumption that most other services benefit from \"good\" timber management, an idea called \"Kielwassertheorie\" or \"wake theory\" (Schuler 1998). Ecosystem services that do not benefit from timber production have often been viewed as constraints. However, increased societal demand for a wider array of goods and services has led to incentives for managers to focus on benefits besides timber (Robert and Stenger 2013). For example, carbon markets, wetland mitigation banking, water quality trading, and conservation easements have the potential to offset the opportunity costs of management decisions that result in suboptimal timber production but cultivate or protect other values (Deal et al. 2012). Regulations and voluntary certification programs like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) also require explicit consideration of nontimber services (Fernholz et al. 2011).",

Increasing tree species diversity in plantations established for timber production has been suggested as one way to increase the potential provision of ecosystem services (Verheyen et al. 2016). Ecosystem processes and structures related to the provisioning of ecosystem services can vary between mixed stands and (monospecific) monocultures. Notably, studies in many systems have found that mixtures of plant species can be more productive than expected when compared with monocultures, a phenomenon known as overyielding (Hector 2006). Experimental studies that compared productivity (measured as biomass or harvestable wood accumulation over time) of monocultures and mixed species in intensively managed plantations have had varied results. In temperate plantations, Amoroso and Turnblom (2006) found that stand density mediates the impact of mixing tree species on stand productivity. In contrast, in tropical plantations, Bouillet et al. (2008) found that mixtures of species were more productive than monocultures on some sites but not on others. The authors attributed this to facilitation (interactions between plants species in which at least one species benefits and neither is harmed) in conjunction with the stress-gradient hypothesis, which states that facilitation is more likely to occur under conditions of high abiotic stress (see Forrester and Bauhus (2016) for detailed discussion and further references on mechanisms affecting species mixing effects on forest productivity). Mixing species in plantations can affect trees and associated vegetation relative to those in monocultures. For example, differences between mixed species and monoculture stands have been found in height of the crown base (Grotta et al. 2004), total height, length of the crown (Bauhus et al. 2004), and tree allometry (Forrester et al. 2017).",
        "3f190353-bce7-4b51-92cf-5a29a0750441": "2004), and tree allometry (Forrester et al. 2017). Understory plant diversity is also influenced by tree species composition because of variation in light infiltration, water availability, and soil chemistry (Barbier et al. 2008). Few studies on mixed-species plantations have considered multiple responses or more than two species, even though high plant diversity is needed to support multiple ecosystem services (Isbell et al. 2011). Mixed-species forests generally provide a greater amount of multiple ecosystem services than monocultures, but the specific species mixture and biogeographical context are important for assessing trade-offs, justifying regional studies of biophysical responses to tree species composition and diversity in plantation forests (Felton et al. 2016). We conducted an exploratory study in even-aged, intensively managed plantations in the coastal Pacific Northwest, United States (USA), to investigate (i) how aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees, mean live crown length (LCL), and diversity of understory plants (DUP) respond to tree species composition and (ii) what trade-offs may exist among these measures of ecosystem components in operational settings. Exploratory studies are a type of observational study and an efficient hybrid of planted experiments and inventory studies for analyzing ecosystem properties in tree species mixtures and comparing them with monocultures in which existing mature stands with comparable environmental conditions and management regimes are explicitly selected to represent a gradient of tree species diversity (Bauhus et al. 2017). The plantations we focused on were 35-39 years old, regenerated from clear-cut harvest, and included monocultures and all species combinations of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.). We focused on tree AGB, mean LCL, and DUP because these measures are responsive to growing conditions and can be related to several ecosystem services. Also, these ecosystem measures can be derived from forest inventory data commonly collected by plantation forest managers.",
        "35f31fce-9f2c-47e6-9b04-aad00c3ed360": "Also, these ecosystem measures can be derived from forest inventory data commonly collected by plantation forest managers. As such, they can be used by managers to make practical assessments of potential ecosystem service response to management decisions. Furthermore, because the stands in this study were managed as working plantations, the results may be more representative of real-world operational conditions than those of planted experiments. Tree AGB was selected as a variable because it is representative of the cumulative productivity of the trees and is integral to multiple ecosystem services such as the provisioning of wood fiber and forest carbon storage (Chojnacky et al. 2014). DUP was selected as a variable because many ecosystem functions and services are mediated by nontree species (Gamfeldt et al. 2013). For example, the understory plant community provides critical habitat and forage for a wide variety of animal species and can directly contribute to numerous cultural and provisioning ecosystem services derived from medicinal and edible species (Whigham 2004). Furthermore, the cover of understory species with functional traits such as tolerance to drought and heat may increase the stability and resilience of understories, as well as the services they provide (Neill and Puettmann 2013). Biodiversity itself is considered an ecosystem service, and the understory plant community represents a large portion of the overall biodiversity of forest systems (Duguid and Ashton 2013). We selected LCL as a variable because it has many attributes that make it an attractive and feasible indicator of multiple potential ecosystem services. It is already widely used in silviculture because it is easy to measure in the field (Maguire and Kanaskie 2002). It is a predictor of tree growth, leaf area, and tree photosynthetic capacity (Gilmore et al. 1996;Maguire and Bennett 1996;Wykoff 1990). LCL is also a surrogate for the distribution of branch biomass, which correlates to the abundance of arthropods (Halaj et al. 2000), an important food source for wildlife (e.g., bats) that feed on insects (Kalcounis et al. 1999).",
        "f3af25c2-cc63-49cb-81fc-2ba22beaafc5": "1999). Crown structure also affects wildlife use of canopy habitat, and larger crowns provide more area for some species of birds to nest and forage in the region (Hayes et al. 1997). Therefore, LCL is a suitable proxy for multiple aspects of the ecosystem (future growth potential, foundational trophic level, and critical structures) and the potential services that they support (wildlife habitat and future wood production or carbon capture). Our objectives were to determine (i) if tree AGB, mean LCL, and DUP individually have positive or negative relationships with tree species diversity; (ii) if tree AGB, mean LCL, and DUP increase or decrease with one another when there are changes in tree species diversity and composition; and (iii) if mixed-species stands can support higher levels of all three measures simultaneously compared with monocultures. We collected field data to estimate the three measures and then assessed their relationships to tree species composition and diversity using a response surface model.",
        "096616b6-f3c3-428f-88c7-43fa19ef846a": "Correlations between tree species composition and diversity differed for the three ecosystem measures considered in this study. The variation in relationships suggests that multiple mechanisms were likely behind the observed patterns, and some of those mechanisms may play out differently in intensively managed systems compared with typical research installations. Those responses may provide insight relevant to plantation managers interested in increasing or maintaining high levels of ecosystem functions. The lack of statistically significant overyielding in our study, as evidenced by the fact that mixtures did not produce more AGB than was expected from their constitutive monocultures, may be partially due to past management actions (Schulze et al. 2018). For example, managers commonly employ techniques intended to reduce tree interactions (and thus species interactions) such as planting at relatively low densities and precommercial thinning. These practices were designed to minimize competition, but they Fig. 3. Mean aboveground biomass of trees, understory diversity (Shannon's diversity index), and live crown length with 95% confidence interval for plots with one, two, and three tree species. also reduce opportunities for facilitation. By maintaining relatively low stand densities through planting and precommercial thinning in the study stands, interactions between trees and interactions between species were minimized for much of the trees' juvenile growth phase, influencing crown-, tree-, and stand-level growth trajectories (Garber and Maguire 2004). Furthermore, when managed at lower densities, the stand canopy may not have an opportunity to stratify, which is one of the primary mechanisms of overyielding in mixed-species forests (Kelty 2006). Thus, our results suggest that typical experimental studies, which tend to be established at higher density to encourage species interactions (e.g., Boyden et al. 2009), may overestimate impacts of species interactions found in intensively managed, real-world landscapes. Similarly, the inclusion of nitrogen-fixing species has been shown to contribute to overyielding (Piotto 2008), but we did not observe overyielding in species mixtures with red alder. However, the potential benefit of including nitrogen-fixing species in mixtures needs to be viewed in the context of nitrogen availability.",
        "48d594e7-2f04-4fe3-ab58-45e97174ecaa": "Specifically, DFRA mixtures have been shown to overyield on low-nitrogen sites (Tarrant 1961) but are less productive on high-nitrogen sites typical of our study area (Binkley 2003). The hypothesis that past management aimed at minimizing competitive impacts on tree and stand productivity was at least partially responsible for our AGB results is also supported by the fact that other ecosystem measures not directly considered in past management of the study stands (i.e., understory diversity and live crown) were greater in mixed stands than expected from respective monocultures. Thus, our results suggest that management opportunities not commonly utilized in production plantations (e.g., cultivating mixed-species stands) may help meet more diverse objectives in terms of ecosystem services (Puettmann et al. 2009). There is general agreement that species identity (as defined by a species' functional traits) may be useful for identifying underlying mechanisms for performance of species mixtures (Lorentzen et al. 2008). Our AGB results appear to be at least partially driven by differences among species in terms of light competition, canopy shape, and relative shade tolerance. For example, in the mixture of western hemlock and red alder, the LCL of western hemlock, combined with its higher shade tolerance, likely facilitated maintenance of western hemlock growth comparable with that of  Overlapped response surface areas representing tree species mixtures that are equal to 86%, 85%, and 89% of the best-performing monocultures in terms of aboveground biomass, understory diversity, and mean live crown length, respectively. The overlap of the shaded regions has been minimized and shows the species composition that achieves the greatest levels predicted of all three variables while minimizing reductions to the others. WH, western hemlock; DF, Douglas-fir; RA, red alder. between the species and reduced the potential for complementary light use (Lu et al. 2016).",
        "ab383b89-12e1-4903-add1-24f95b73ab2d": "2016). The greater red alder AGB in mixtures with both conifers suggests that the canopy architecture of the conifers and deciduous red alder may have been complimentary, which has been observed in other forest communities (Pretzsch 2014). In the case of the two conifers mixing, the AGB of each component species was very similar to its respective monoculture, likely because of the low contrast in functional traits between the two species. Other studies of species mixtures with low contrasting functional traits (deciduous-deciduous mixtures) also did not show overyielding (e.g., Lu et al. 2016). Tree species identity may also have influenced DUP. For example, our results suggest that mixing very shade-intolerant tree species with very shade-tolerant species such as western hemlock may be related to greater DUP than would be expected from the mean of the respective monocultures. This is because DUP can be affected by light infiltration (Hill 1979;Jennings 1999), and very shadetolerant tree species tend to allow less light infiltration than intermediate shade-tolerant species (Canham et al. 1994). Conversely, shade-intolerant deciduous species such as red alder allow greater light infiltration when leaves are on and allow full penetration in early spring and late fall (Moore al. 2011). The high levels of DUP associated with red alder suggest that the understory vegetation may have benefited from the same conditions that allowed red alder to become established (e.g., herbicide skips and skid trails) Also, the understory may have benefited from the impact of red alder nitrogen fixation (Hanley et al. 2006). The DUP results in this study generally align with previous research on other species in other systems, which supports the hypothesis that shade-intolerant deciduous species support higher levels of DUP than mixtures (Berger and Puettmann 2000). Generally, DUP tends to be greatest under deciduous monocultures, whereas conifer species tend to support lower DUP, and DUP is positively related to tree species diversity (Barbier et al.",
        "6ddb3c93-7d48-4bb9-b78c-a2bf9bc2b8c1": "2008). The exception to this pattern in our study was Douglas-fir, which supported a surprisingly high level of DUP in monoculture, presumably because of the presence of Swiss needle cast, which reduces Douglasfir leaf area, thus permitting more light infiltration to support understory species (Hansen et al. 2000). This exemplifies how factors exogenous of species identity and diversity per se, for example, disease and management, can modify species interactions. In addition to the mechanisms previously described, other factors may complicate the interpretation of the study results. For example, microsite edaphic factors may influence where naturally seeding western hemlock and red alder occur and the composition of the understory plant community. Similarly, areas missed by herbicide spray or areas where different herbicides were used may affect the likelihood of these species naturally seeding into an area and may affect tree growth and understory plant composition. Because this was an observational study and not a planted experiment, we were only able to indirectly control for these factors by choosing stands of similar age and management history from a representative range of environmental factors known to relate to soils and plant growth (e.g., elevation, aspect, and site index). The strength of the study design was that it allowed the rapid assessment of correlations between tree species composition and other ecosystem variables at any point in time in stand development. The study approach also enabled assessment across a relatively large geographic area under operational management without the expense, time, and restrictions required for planted experiments. Regarding the first objective of the study, we found no statistically significant positive relationship between biomass of trees and tree species diversity, but DUP and mean LCL both had higher values than expected in some mixtures, based on the performance of monocultures. Regarding the second objective of the study, we identified trade-offs between different ecosystem responses as a result of tree species composition, namely that tree AGB and DUP showed opposite trends along a gradient of mixtures of western hemlock and red alder.",
        "b86d35a3-7244-43bf-bdfd-267bbbb21c6d": "Regarding the third objective of the study, we found that if high levels of multiple ecosystem functions as represented by tree AGB, DUP, and LCL are desired, then a neareven mixture of all three species was preferable to any monoculture alternative. This supports the theory that complementary effects are generally greatest in mixtures with relatively even proportions of species, as each individual is more likely to directly interact with individuals of a different species (Forrester and Bauhus 2016). Our results also support the theory that greater tree species diversity supports high levels of multiple ecosystem functions, even though monocultures produce higher levels of single functions (Gamfeldt et al. 2008;Isbell et al. 2011;van der Plas et al. 2016). Our results suggest that within intensively managed plantations, individual ecosystem responses may not be positively related to tree species diversity; however, when multiple indicators of ecosystem functions are simultaneously considered, mixed stands perform better than monocultures. In determining the species composition that optimized all three ecosystem responses, each was considered equally desirable. In operational settings, it is much more likely that one or more ecosystem services will be important to specific managers based on their objectives. Managers can easily apply different weighting schemes to reflect their own preferences and objectives. Furthermore, certain ecosystem functions and services may have important thresholds such that reductions beyond a certain point are unacceptable to managers. If such thresholds are implemented, minimum values can be used to constrain the range of species composition that is acceptable. For example, investment-based managers may need to achieve positive cash flow or a minimum rate of return. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize trade-offs implicit in managing to a single objective because myopic focus on the efficient provisioning of a single ecosystem service (e.g., timber) has the potential of undesired outcomes (Messier and Puettmann 2011). As society looks toward production plantations to provide a broader suite of ecosystem services, management strategies, including mixing tree species, that support multiple ecosystem functions are likely to become more important (Bauhus et al.",

In areas with increasing population pressure, it is becoming less tenable to focus on one single ecosystem service and exclude all others, whether that focus is on timber, habitat, or wilderness (Sarr and Puettmann 2008). One size likely does not fit all for forest management, and the \"Kielwassertheorie\" (wake theory) that assumes that all social functions of forests are automatically provided in the wake of production management is clearly questionable (Schuler 1998).",

Findings suggest that on decadal timescales, reclaimed mine sites contain approximately 40% of the total carbon and 10% the AGB carbon of undisturbed forest. This raises questions regarding the potential for decommissioning mine sites to provide forestry-based legacies. Such a move could deliver a host of benefits, including improving the longevity and success of reclamation, mitigating climate change and delivering corollary enumeration for local communities under carbon trading schemes. A discussion of the antecedents and challenges associated with establishing forest-legacies highlights the risk of neglecting the participation and heterogeneity of legitimate local representatives, which threatens the equity of potential benefits and sustainability of projects.

This agenda is becoming increasingly dominated by concerns over climate change, widely recognised as one of the most important challenges of the 21 st century (Stern, 2006). Mining corporate sustainability strategies, therefore, have increasingly engaged with the issues of carbon emissions mitigation and carbon accounting (Pellegrino and Lodhia, 2012). The emergence of strategies to manage carbon emissions from land-use change presents an opportunity for mining companies to augment their sustainability credentials by using carbon finance to support reclamation of mined land to forests,1 and the economic development of local host communities. Although some companies have started to engage with payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes (Olsen et al., 2011), the potential for forestry-based legacies has received limited attention (Gilberthorpe and Banks, 2012). It is timely, therefore, to critically review the basis for, and implications of, such schemes. Drawing on interdisciplinary research conducted in Ghana, this paper aims to gauge the potential for forest-based legacies by providing an initial quantification of the carbon stocks associated with reclamation in forest areas, exploring how key stakeholders understand and influence the reclamation of mine sites, and reflecting on the potential implications of mining companies harnessing carbon finance as part of their sustainability strategies. The findings suggest that forestry-based legacies could go a long way towards mitigating the adverse socio-ecological impacts associated with unplanned and poorly executed mine closures (Laurence, 2007). The discussion also highlights how the global focus on climate change risks marginalising the concerns of local communities and exacerbating the already-inequitable sharing of natural resource-derived benefits. Nonetheless, pursuing pilot projects would help to address the lack of data and transparency that currently characterises mine reclamation in countries such as Ghana.",

Surveys of above-ground biomass of 264 reforestation sites (132 woodlots, 132 environmental plantings) within the agricultural regions of South Australia were conducted, and combined with spatial information on climate and soils, to develop new spatial and temporal models of plant density and above-ground biomass productivity from reforestation.

To assist planning with this uncertainty, considerable efforts have been made to gather comprehensive regional natural resource information, develop analysis tools and provide assessment of land use planning options with a range of possible future scenarios and timeframes (Selman, 2006;Bryan et al., 2008;Polglase et al., 2008;Crossman and Bryan, 2009;Hobbs, 2009;Hobbs et al., 2010Hobbs et al., , 2013;;Bryan et al., 2011;Polglase et al., 2013;Wise et al., 2014;Summers et al., 2015;Connor et al., 2015;Gao et al., 2016). In southern Australia, future land use planning is aware that the majority of suitable land is privately owned, cleared of native vegetation and developed for agricultural production. Food and fibre industries (e.g. cereals, meat, wool, horticulture and forestry) dominate this production that supports the economic activity of local communities. Government policies support the existence of these industries and recognise the need to manage the soil and water resources on which these industries are based. In addition, policies and markets have evolved to support biodiversity conservation (e.g. native vegetation management), encourage carbon sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide through revegetation and adapt to expected changes in climates (Suppiah et al., 2006;IPCC, 2013IPCC, , 2014)).",

Consideration of current and future blends of traditional agricultural industries and new carbon or environmental plantings is dependent on credible comparisons between land use options. While the productivity and profitability of most traditional food and fibre industries is underpinned by sound science and economics, the quality of such information for reforestation productivity and carbon markets is limited (Bryan et al., 2011;Parrott and Meyer, 2012). Refining estimates of carbon sequestration by reforestation at regional and local scales is a high priority. Reforestation or revegetation is a land use option sanctioned by the Australian government to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and to generate a carbon credit commodity that has an economic value within domestic carbon markets (i.e. Emissions Reduction Fund, Carbon Farming Initiative, Australian Government, 2011aGovernment, ,b, 2015;;DOTE, 2015a). Carbon stored in reforestation is included in Australian National Greenhouse Accounts and reported under international obligations (DOTE, 2015a).

They are mostly based on research results from commercial forestry species in higher rainfall zones of Australia. In recent years, these forestry models have been adapted to also represent environmental plantings and carbon accumulation in medium to lower rainfall regions. The resultant estimates have often underestimated biomass yields in reforestation (Montagu et al., 2003;Paul et al., 2008;Wood et al., 2008;Hobbs et al., 2010;Keith et al., 2010;Landsberg and Sands, 2011;Fensham et al., 2012;Paul et al., 2013bPaul et al., , 2015)). Reliable calibration of these models for environmental plantings has been constrained by the lack of data collected outside of high-rainfall forestry species and regions. Some recent and significant improvements have been made in early growth calibrations for environmental planting models within FullCAM (Paul et al., 2013b(Paul et al., , 2015)). Australia's main carbon accounting methodology for environmental plantings (i.e. Reforestation by Environmental or Mallee Plantings -FullCAM Method; Australian Government, 2014) is based on a point-based FullCAM model that uses spatial FPI data to estimate current and future reforestation productivity and carbon stocks with historic climatic conditions. The current version of FullCAM only provide broad classifications of planting designs (e.g.",

The magnitude of these variations is greatest for environmental plantings with low to moderate plant densities (Paul et al., 2013b(Paul et al., , 2015)). The accuracy of local applications of FullCAM for carbon accounting for reforestation projects is very limited due to the coarse scale of the underlying FPI data used in the model. The extrapolation of soil fertility modifiers developed for the FPI in high-rainfall conditions is likely to produce errors in lower-rainfall regions, where water is a more dominant growth factor (Kesteven et al., 2004;Landsberg and Sands, 2011). Process-based models (e.g. 3 PG, CABALA) have the potential to reliably estimate reforestation productivity and carbon stocks but insufficient data exists to provide reliable species (or mixed species) model calibrations or site parameterisations for models in many regions (Landsberg and Sands, 2011;Song et al., 2012). In response to the limitations of current models and the sensitivity of carbon market analyses to variations in estimates of carbon sequestration from reforestation projects we developed locallycalibrated models of primary productivity and carbon sequestration from reforestation in the agricultural regions of South Australia. These models were intended to facilitate better regional land use planning by providing more reliable spatial and temporal estimates of primary productivity of reforestation options in the region, inform carbon markets of typical sequestration rates of these options, and anticipate the likely effects of climate change on future carbon stocks.

We compare above-ground biomass accumulation of both planted and naturally regenerating trees, as well as C in the top soil layer, in three restoration treatments replicated at 14, six to eight year old restoration sites in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies include: control (no planting), planting tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. We evaluate the importance of past landuse, soil nutrients, understory cover, and surrounding forest cover in explaining variation in aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) rate across sites. Total ABA and planted tree ABA rate were highest in plantations, intermediate in islands, and lowest in control treatments, whereas ABA rate of naturally regenerating trees did not differ across treatments. Most ABA in plantations (89%) and islands (70%) was due to growth of planted trees. Soil carbon did not change significantly over the time period of the study in any treatment. The majority of across-site variation in both total and planted tree ABA rate was explained by duration of prior pasture use. Tree growth in the first two years after planting explained approximately two-thirds of the variation in ABA rate after 6-8 years. Soil nutrient concentrations explained relatively little of the variation in planted or naturally recruiting ABA rate. Our results show that planting trees substantially increases biomass accumulation during the first several years of forest recovery in former agricultural lands and that past-land use has a strong effect on the rate of biomass accumulation. Planting tree islands is a cost-effective strategy for increasing ABA and creating more heterogeneous habitat conditions than tree plantations. We recommend small scale planting trials to quickly assess potential biomass accumulation and prioritize sites for ecosystem service payments for carbon sequestration.",

This increase is due to both natural regeneration and active reforestation and restoration (Lamb, 2011;Aide et al., 2013). Given that tropical forest clearing comprises at least 12% of carbon emissions (van der Werf et al., 2009), there is an increasing focus on the role that forest recovery may play in sequestering carbon as part of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+, Edwards et al., 2010;Elias and Lininger, 2010;Harvey et al., 2010). This interest is clearly demonstrated by the large number of studies that have monitored the amount of C sequestered in both above-ground biomass and soil carbon in both tropical forest plantations and naturally regenerating tropical forests (Bonner et al., 2013;Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma, 2013;Martin et al., 2013). Past studies show that the rate of above-ground biomass and soil C accumulation are highly variable at global and regional scales, which presents a challenge for predicting how much carbon can be sequestered as part of REDD+ programs and prioritizing areas to receive payments. Recent global scale meta-analyses indicate that differences in biomass and soil C accumulation are best explained by climate (primarily upland vs. lowland forests), total rainfall, soil type, and often past land-use (Silver et al., 2000;Paul et al., 2002;Cleveland et al., 2011;Bonner et al., 2013;Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma, 2013). Even at a relatively local scale many studies have shown high variability in tree growth, natural regeneration, and changes in soil C after land abandonment (Sarmiento et al., 2005;Sierra et al., 2007;Fonseca et al., 2012).",
        "8a9d9902-2daf-431b-9970-f3f4d38dd28f": "Studies consistently show that above-ground biomass of both planted and naturally regenerating trees increases over time with particularly high rates of accumulation in the first 20 years post-abandonment (Silver et al., 2000;Mar\u00edn-Spiotta et al., 2008;Bonner et al., 2013), but factors that explain differences in accumulation rates across sites in the same region vary. Intensity and duration of past land-use most commonly explain some of this variance (Uhl et al., 1988;Silver et al., 2000;Steininger, 2000), but a few studies have shown no effect (Steininger, 2000;Letcher and Chazdon, 2009). Similarly, soil fertility explains differences in some cases (Carpenter et al., 2004a;Lawrence, 2005;Pe\u00f1a and Duque, 2013), but not in others (Feldpausch et al., 2004;Holl et al., 2011). Rules of thumb for predicting the variability in carbon sequestered across sites within a region remain elusive, which is partly due to the lack of wellreplicated studies with data on baseline conditions. An important question in designing strategies to enhance biomass and carbon accumulation in former agricultural lands is the relative effect of active restoration strategies, such as tree planting, compared to leaving land to regenerate naturally (Holl and Aide, 2011). Although a number of individual studies show that aboveground C accumulates faster in plantations than in natural regenerating sites (reviewed in Mar\u00edn-Spiotta et al., 2008), a recent meta-analysis comparing monoculture tree plantations to natural regeneration sites across the tropics suggests that the effect of tree planting on above-ground biomass accumulation is weak and decreases with forest age (Bonner et al., 2013). Bonner et al. (2013), however, found few studies where natural regeneration and tree planting were compared in the same system and did not have sufficient studies of mixed-species tree planting to conduct a metaanalysis.",
        "7227e1fc-00cc-4401-86ea-2b3cbfae3b60": "Moreover, most past studies of both above-ground and soil C have relied on chronosequences rather than changes within individual sites over time, which can be problematic as they assume comparability of past land-use and other site conditions (Chazdon et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2010), and have been shown to overestimate biomass accumulation during the first several years of succession (Feldpausch et al., 2007). Most past studies of tropical forest restoration have focused on tree planting using a mixture of native species. This commonly applied strategy accelerates forest recovery by encouraging animal seed dispersal, reducing cover of light-demanding pasture grasses, ameliorating microclimatic conditions, and enhancing nutrient availability (Chazdon, 2008;Lamb, 2011). Planting large areas of land with trees, however, can be costly (Lamb et al., 2005;Kanowski et al., 2008), and result in more homogeneous abiotic conditions than natural recovery (Holl et al., 2013). Moreover, the planted species selected can strongly influence biomass accumulation rates, nutrient cycling, and composition of naturally establishing species (Cusack and Montagnini, 2004;Celentano et al., 2011), particularly since fast-growing, low wood density species, including some N-fixers, are often selected for restoration plantings (Lamb, 2011). Applied nucleation (i.e., planting trees in patches or islands) comprises an alternative hybrid forest restoration strategy between passive and plantation-style restoration that is less homogeneous and resource intensive (Rey Benayas et al., 2008;Corbin and Holl, 2012). This approach builds on observations that pioneer shrubs and trees naturally establish patchily in abandoned agricultural fields and facilitate the recruitment of other woody species via enhanced seed dispersal and improved establishment conditions (Yarranton and Morrison, 1974).",
        "f654faee-9daa-48ad-b6d2-a7544bc219ec": "The few experimental studies to date suggest that this strategy serves to enhance seed dispersal and seedling establishment in the first few years after planting (Robinson and Handel, 2000;Zahawi and Augspurger, 2006;Cole et al., 2010;Zahawi et al., 2013), but there have been no comparisons of woody biomass accumulation with other restoration strategies. In this paper, we report on tree above-ground biomass accumulation (ABA) rate and soil C changes over the first 6-8 years of a wellreplicated tropical forest restoration experiment. At each of 14 sites spread across a 100 km 2 area in premontane forest in southern Costa Rica, we established three restoration treatments: 1. Control -natural regeneration only; 2. Island -applied nucleation with six mixed-species tree islands; and 3. Plantation -planting the entire plot with the same mix of tree species. From the outset of the experiment we found highly variable rates of both planted tree growth and natural regeneration (Holl et al., 2011;Zahawi et al., 2013), and both the applied nucleation and plantation restoration strategies enhanced seed dispersal and seedling establishment compared to control plots (Cole et al., 2010;Zahawi et al., 2013). Here we: (1) compare changes in both planted and naturally regenerating ABA rate in the three restoration treatments, and (2) investigate which factors best predict the variation across sites. Our aim is to provide information on the most promising restoration strategies and site prioritization criteria for enhancing ABA. We also report changes in soil C, but place less of an emphasis on this since past studies show that soil C changes tend to be small over the first 10 years of reforestation compared to above-ground changes (Paul et al., 2002) and generally do not show consistent correlations with forest age or differences in plantations vs. naturally regenerating lands (Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma, 2013).",

To offset these losses, efforts in the late 1990s have resulted in thousands of hectares of mangroves being restored, but few studies to date have examined how effective these efforts are at creating restored mangrove forests that function similarly to the intact mangroves they are intended to replace. Materials and Methods: We quantified and compared soil carbon (C) stocks among restored (mono and mixed species) and intact mangrove forests in the provinces of Quang Ninh, Thai Binh, Nam Dinh and Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam. A total of 96 soil cores up to a depth of 200 cm were collected every 25 m (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 m) along 16 linear transects that were 150 m long and perpendicular to the mangrove upland interface (six cores along each transect) at Quang Ninh (four transects), Thai Binh (five), Nam Dinh (four) and Thanh Hoa (three). Five-cm-long soil samples were then collected from the 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-100 cm, and >100 cm depth intervals of each soil core. Results: The study confirmed that the soil C stock of 20-25-year-old restored mangrove forest (217.74 \u00b1 16.82 Mg/ha) was not significantly different from that of intact mangrove forest (300.68 \u00b1 51.61 Mg/ha) (p > 0.05).",

This carbon (C) is assimilated and stored in aboveground tree biomass (i.e., stems, branches, leaves and roots) and in soils as both belowground roots and trapped sediments [6]. Up to 90% of mangrove C stocks are stored in anaerobic and waterlogged soil conditions that inhibit microbial breakdown of C and can result in long-term storage if left undisturbed [7][8][9][10]. This also results in mangroves storing 10-15% of coastal sediment C stocks despite only representing 0.5% of the world's coastlines [11,12]. The ability to remove and store large amounts of C has significantly increased the role mangroves play in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and thus climate change mitigation and adaptation [13]. Mangroves in Vietnam are mainly distributed in the estuarine areas of 29 coastal provinces. Total mangrove forest area of Vietnam was estimated at 408,500 ha in 1943 [14]. However, the area of mangroves dropped sharply over the past 70 years to 131,520 ha in 2016 [15] due to the aftermath of a destructive war and excessive exploitation of forests. In northern Vietnam, about 37,100 ha of mangroves were lost from 1964-1997 to deforestation for the creation of shrimp aquaculture ponds. Since 1994, thousands of ha of mangroves, mainly Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu & Yong and Sonneratia caseolaris (L.)

Under artificial plantations, the vegetation layer (including roots) had a mean carbon density of 111.3 t/hm 2 , the litter layer a density of 5.1 t/hm 2 , and the soil layer a density of 64.9 t/hm 2 . These values accounted for 28.6%, 13.8%, and 61.0% of their respective counterparts in the natural secondary forests under the same site conditions in the region. The ratios of carbon density among vegetation, litter, and soil pools were 39.6:1.8:58.6 for artificial forests and 57.4:2.7:39.9 for natural forests. The carbon densities of the vegetation and litter layers increased exponentially with forest age. The total carbon density ratios were also increasing gradually. Although the mean total carbon density of the artificial forests in the rehabilitated lands was 281.2 t/hm 2 in the experimental area, it accounted for only 41.5% of the carbon density of the natural secondary forests (677.4 t/hm 2 ). The annual increase in total carbon density of artificial forests was as high as 15.2 t/hm 2 , which was 11.7% more than that of natural forests and 6.8 times higher than that (1.95 t/hm) of artificial forests in the entire country as measured during 1994-1998.  This indicates that growth and carbon storage capacity of artificial forests in the rehabilitated lands were higher than those of forests on the barren hills and the secondary forests.

But things have changed to affect the earth's system globally since the Industrial Revolution, especially in the late 1950s (Keeling, 1997;Schimel, 1998). The volume fraction of CO 2 has increased from (280\u00b110)\u00d710 -6 in 1860 to 360\u00d710 -6 in the late twentieth century (Xing, 2000), a 28% increase in 140 years (Watson and Verardo, 2000), which leads to air temperature increase, drought, waterlog, and other weather changes by increasing the ability to absorb the long-wave radiant of the atmosphere. During the twentieth century the air temperature in the planet increased from 0.3 to 0.6\u00b0C (Li, 1996).

Afforestation is often motivated by government policies, and is likely to be reinforced in the future by the prospective carbon (C) sequestration market (Farley et al., 2005;Laclau, 2003;Nosetto et al., 2006). Increasing net C sequestration by afforestation is one way of offsetting national CO 2 emissions permitted under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Davis and Condron, 2002;Smith, 1999). Studies on the effects of afforestation on total ecosystem C stocks have been widely reported in recent years (e.g., Alfredsson et al., 1998;Davis and Condron, 2002;Gru \u00a8nzweig et al., 2003;Laclau, 2003;Nosetto et al., 2006;Paul et al., 2002;Scott et al., 1999;Zinn et al., 2002). Although it is certain that afforestation will contribute to C sequestration in forest biomasses, the impact that forest planting will have on soil C storage is much less certain, and may vary with other factors such as precipitation, soil texture, stand age, and forest type (Davis and Condron, 2002;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002). The restoration of degraded arid and semiarid lands by the reintroduction of woody species has become a worldwide method for protecting soils, combating desertification, supplying natural resources, and increasing C sequestration (Gru \u00a8nzweig et al., 2003;Kumar et al., 2001;Maestre and Cortina, 2004;Nosetto et al., 2006).",

Guo and Gifford (2002) found that the conversion of grassland into forest had little effect on soil C stocks in low rainfall areas, but significantly reduced soil C stocks in higher rainfall areas. Soil C sequestration may be limited by rates of C accumulation and turnover in reestablishing a forest, which can be facilitated by coarse soil texture and low-activity clay mineralogy (Richter et al., 1999). Knowledge of the changes in soil organic C following grassland afforestation is uncertain, and more data are needed, particularly regarding semiarid sandy land (Gru \u00a8nzweig et al., 2003;Jackson et al., 2002;Nosetto et al., 2006). In recent decades, afforestation using tree species has become an increasingly important method of land-cover change in the arid and semiarid regions of northern China, including a large sandy area (1.53 \u00c2 10 6 km 2 ). These plantations have been established in the interest of desertification control and timber production in sandy areas (Chen et al., 2006). The Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) and poplar (Populus spp.) are two of the most commonly planted trees. The planting of Mongolian pine began in the 1950s in Zhanggutai, Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, located in the southeastern Keerqin Sandy Lands (Zeng et al., 1996).

Losses of C in the mineral soil were partially compensated for by the increased C stocks in roots. Thus, the net belowground C stocks did not differ significantly following afforestation with Mongolian pine and poplar. These results support the view that living wood is the dominant sink for atmospheric CO 2 within regrowth forests (Schlesinger and Lichter, 2001). However, the belowground C stocks of the plantations may have been underestimated in our study. We calculated the root biomass by taking soil samples from which the roots were sorted by hand. This method does not consider the C stocks of the taproot biomass, which can be a very important component of C stocks in forests (Laclau, 2003). From the 1950s to 1998s, the total afforested Mongolian pine and poplar plantation area of Inner Mongolia had increased to 0.26 and 1.78 million ha, respectively. As an approximation, if we assume that all the afforested lands of Inner Mongolia were originally grassland, and that all Mongolian pine plantations are 30 years old and poplar plantations 15 years old, we estimate that afforestation with these two species could potentially sequester about 8.7 \u00c2 10 7 Mg more C than would the grassland in this region. This quantity of C sequestration amounts to 136% of the C emitted from fossil-fuel combustion during 2002-2004 (6.4 \u00c2 10 7 Mg C) in Inner Mongolia, and about 10% of that emitted in 1998 (84.8 \u00c2 10 7 Mg C) in China (Marland et al., 2007).

The rehabilitation plots were planted with mixed dipterocarp and non-dipterocarp species since 1991. Prior to conversion of the areas into various land use types, the rehabilitation and secondary forests areas were considered as natural forests and subsequently subjected to forest logging with Selective Management System (SMS) in 1980s.The plot size for each site was 20\u00d720 m for 18 experimental sites (at different ages after planting) were established, followed by soil sampling at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth randomly using soil auger. Standard soil analysis for physical and chemical properties was used to analyze the soil samples. The soil fertility status was evaluated using two indices, namely Soil Fertility Index (SFI) and Soil Evaluation Factor (SEF) for both rehabilitated and secondary forests. The results showed that there were significant differences (p<0.05) in pH (water and KCl), exchangeable Mg, Na, Al and ammonium and granule composition (clay, silt and sand) between depths. The PCA result of 70% total variability (OM, TOC, TC and CEC) score in PC1 shows positive relationship, explaining nutrients in the soil stored in the organic matter in the surface soils. The correlation analysis indicated that there were positive relationship (p<0.05) between OM and TC, CEC and exchangeable Al for surface soils. We found that the selected physico-chemical properties had a significant differences based on the age of planting of rehabilitated forests.",

The SFI and SEF for rehabilitation forests showed higher value as compared to secondary forests, indicating forest rehabilitation had improved the soil fertility status of degraded forestland. In conclusion, both rehabilitated and secondary forests have significant differences based on the selected physical and chemical properties. Moreover, the soil fertility status at rehabilitated plots was higher than secondary forest, which is proved that the forest rehabilitation technique is a suitable planting technique for rehabilitating and replenishing soil fertility status of abandoned degraded shifting cultivation land.",

These forests consist of unique and complex ecosystems which are home to the country's rich flora and fauna. Tropical forest area is disappearing at the rate of 13.5 million ha per year, mainly due to clearing for plantation or agriculture and shifting cultivation (Daljit et al., 2011). According to FAO (2010), Malaysia's total forest area decreased by 434 000 hectares between 2005 and 2010 (an annual decline of 0.42%) and by 1.92 million hectares between 1990 and 2010 of the estimated 17.1 million hectares of dry inland forests, 5.48 million hectares are in Peninsular Malaysia, 7.83 million hectares are in Sarawak and 3.84 million hectares are in Sabah (ITTO, 2011). In Sarawak, besides forest harvesting and forest encroachment, shifting cultivation is the major cause of land degradation. It was reported that 2.25 million ha were under shifting cultivation in the 1960s and by 1985 increased to 3.33 million ha (ITTO, 2011). Deforestation of tropical forest could affect global warming by accelerating the greenhouse gases emission and increasing the accumulation of CO 2 as a result of photosynthesis (Kobayashi, 1994). Tropical forests have the largest potential to mitigate climate change amongst the world's forest through conservation of existing C pools through the establishment of forest plantations and agroforestry program (Brown et al., 1989). Grainger (1993) stated that deforestation exposes soil to erosion and to four other forms of degradation such as fertility depletion, compaction and landslides. The effect of soil degradation becomes apparent locally, resulting in low productivity and sustainability of farming on degraded soils (Grainger, 1993).",

In addition, forest rehabilitation also attempts to return the forest to a stable and productive condition in terms of soil fertility status, but not necessarily the original diversity, structure and function. Forest rehabilitation of rainforest is often undertaken with two primary reasons which are to restore the ecology stability for facilities, biological and chemical improvement of degraded sites and to restore productivity of degraded sites in order to gain economic returns through agriculture or forestry which commonly involves plantation of native and exotic species on degraded forest land (Lamb and Olsen, 1992). One technique has been carried out in Bintulu, Sarawak using mixed dense planting method for rehabilitating degraded shifting cultivation area (Miyawaki, 2010). The indigenous tree species recommended were Shoreaovata, S. macrophylla, S. mecistopteryx, Dryobalanops aromatica, Parashorea parvifolia, Hopea beccariana, Durio carinatus and Eusideroxylon zwagery (Alias et al., 1998). Forest rehabilitation activity on degraded tropical rainforest should emphasize on the ecosystem involving soil properties, soil fertility and species selection for the progress of rehabilitation techniques in the future (Arifin et al., 2008a). The progress of rehabilitation program under tropical conditions has been reported by several researchers (Arifin et al., 2008b;Cole et al., 1996;MacNamara et al., 2006;Tilki and Fisher, 1998;Norisada et al., 2005).",

Therefore, preliminary assessment of rehabilitation program in relation to soil fertility status using soil indices could provide information on soil suitability for species preferences and improve effective technique for future rehabilitation program. The objective of this study was to characterize the soil properties and identifying the soil fertility status of rehabilitated and secondary forests using soil Fertility Index (SFI) and Soil Evaluation Factor (SEF).

Deforestation continues to be one of the main causes of the release of C into the atmosphere, but forest restoration plantations can reverse this scenario. However, there is still diffuse information about the C and nutrient stocks in the vegetation biomass. We investigated the carbon and nutrient stocks of Fabaceae trees (Inga edulis, Schizolobium amazonicum and Dipteryx odorata) subjected to fertilization treatments (T1 -no fertilization; T2 -chemical; T3 -organic; and T4 -organic and chemical fertilization) in a degraded area of the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam, AM -Brazil. As an early successional species, I. edulis stocked more C and nutrients than the other two species independent of the fertilization treatment, and S. amazonicum stocked more C than D. odorata under T1 and T4. The mixed species plantation had the potential to stock 4.1 Mg C ha -1 year -1 , while I. edulis alone could stock 9.4 Mg C ha -1 year -1 . Mixing species that rapidly assimilate C and are of significant ecological and commercial value (e.g., Fabaceae trees) represents a good way to restore degraded areas.

In many ways, deforestation and forest degradation have exacerbated these changes by releasing CO 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) that were previously stored in the forest biomass into the atmosphere (Houghton 2005). Tropical forests have a significant capacity to store C and other nutrients in their biomass, and the C can then be released through burning or decomposition, primarily from conversion into pastures and agricultural fields, which are the primary causes of forest degradation in Amazonia (Houghton et al. 2000, Achard et al. 2002, Karsten et al. 2013). Although some studies have shown that almost 20% of the original Amazonian forest cover has disappeared, forest degradation may be higher depending on the monitoring system (Asner et al. 2005, Davidson et al. 2012). ROBERTO K. JAQUETTI and JOS\u00c9 FRANCISCO C. GON\u00c7ALVES Forest restoration plantations have the capacity to recover large amounts of C stocks in a short time while simultaneously producing goods and services (Ruiz-Jaen and Potvin 2011, Houghton 2012, Guariguata and Brancalion 2014), but the choice of species and their silvicultural traits is a fundamental aspect of this practice (Fang et al. 2007). A mixture of different ecological groups (pioneer and late-successional species) is desirable to better use the available resources and therefore enhance C stocks (Rodrigues et al. 2009). Forest restoration is an effective way to restore biodiversity and C stocks, especially under severe degradation (Soares-Filho et al. 2014), but transcending ecosystem barriers is very difficult as non-adapted species can easily collapse and die (Rowland et al. 2015).",

The main obstacles to be overcome in the degraded ecosystems of the Amazon are high irradiance and temperatures, periods of drought and, especially, the low natural fertility of the soils that are the major limiting factor for C assimilation and plant growth (Gon\u00e7alves and Santos Junior 2005, Santos Junior et al. 2006, Ferreira et al. 2009, Jaquetti et al. 2014, 2016). Therefore, the study of the use of different fertilization treatments in forest restoration and the responses of native species to these treatments is essential to develop planting designs that are capable of better utilizing available resources to increase stand-level productivity and individual tree growth rates, and the use of Fabaceae trees is important to achieve these objectives in degraded landscapes (Siddique et al. 2008). These species are well adapted to low nutrient availability and arid ecosystems, as they have developed the capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) through bacterial symbiosis (Macedo et al. 2008, Joslin et al. 2011). Thus, they can rapidly rebuild C and N stocks through rapid biomass production (Tapia-Coral et al. 2005), which in turn is an excellent success indicator of forest restoration projects (Viana et al.",

Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (C T ) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and C T values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y-this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios.",
        "1649d41e-8505-45ba-84ea-e15b6823bc4d": "Climate change and global warming have been reported as the most pressing concerns worldwide in recent years [1][2][3][4]. In addition, several environmental issues, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, shifting rainfall patterns, and risks for human health and wildlife, are expected to increase in the coming years in response to the climate crisis [1][2][3][4]. Therefore, strategies that can efficiently increase carbon sequestration have a fundamental role in mitigating global warming, especially those that use nature as a tool to restore natural environments [2,5,6]. These \"nature-based solutions\" [7][8][9] are included in initiatives for the protection, restoration, and sustainable management of ecosystems as they address multiple societal and environmental challenges simultaneously [2,10,11]. Mangrove restoration and protection are essential for achieving sustainable goals, such as climate change mitigation [5,12,13], as mangrove forests are one of the most efficient C sinks. Previous studies have reported that mangroves sequester approximately 13.5 Gt C year -1 [14], most of which is captured in their soils (49-98% of the ecosystem C content is stored in the soil) [14,15]. The large C storage and sequester capacity of mangrove forests and other coastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) have led to the creation of the term \"Blue Carbon sinks\" [16][17][18][19]. The stored carbon in mangrove soils exists in living (roots) and non-living biomass (litter and deadwood), as well as in the organic matter incorporated into the soil [15,[20][21][22][23]. Soil organic matter (SOM) can remain stored for a millennial scale or be mineralized in the short term (within years or decades) [21,[24][25][26].",
        "43088b47-8e33-4f7e-9bee-914d30d39cff": "The high C content in coastal wetland soils occurs because of the specific biogeochemical conditions resulting from the combination of the high primary productivity of the plants and the soil characteristics, such as high salinity, circumneutral pH, mineral interactions, and low availability of oxygen, which compromises organic matter decomposition [18,19]. However, some drivers of the mechanisms of SOM stabilization and protection from decomposition remain poorly understood, especially in coastal wetland ecosystems. Several studies have indicated that the complex molecular structure of SOM is not sufficient to explain its high stability [24] and that organomineral interactions can be recognized as key components for the protection of SOM, thereby preventing decomposition [21][22][23][24]. Accordingly, Fe oxyhydroxides (e.g., ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite) play an important role in preserving organic C in mangrove soils because of the formation of stable complexes by ligand exchange between the organic matter and reactive Fe [23][24][25]. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the C accumulation and stabilization of organic matter in mangrove soils is crucial to comprehensively assess the resilience of these ecosystems in the face of degradation and their development in response to restoration initiatives. Therefore, this study aims to: (i) assess the development of soil carbon stocks (SCSs) in mangrove forests under a revegetation scenario and (ii) identify the role of organomineral interactions on SOM stabilization in mangrove forests under revegetation.",

This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3-and 7-year-old replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by 42% and 29% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively. In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles, reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and potential metal retention.

Among the ecosystem services provided by mangroves, those associated with soil processes (e.g., carbon sequestration and pollutant immobilization) [2][3][4][5] are currently among the most addressed. Accordingly, mangrove preservation and restoration programs that guarantee the proper functioning of their soils are vital to ensure ecosystem services [6,7]. In mangrove ecosystems, the soil functions are associated with their unique geochemical conditions. These forests are subjected to daily water saturation, leading to low O 2 diffusion into soil pores [8][9][10]. After total O 2 consumption by aerobic respiration, facultative and obligate anaerobic microorganisms progressively use oxidized species (NO 3 -, Mn 4+ , Fe 3+ , SO 4 2-, CO 2 , and N 2 ) as electron acceptors for soil organic matter decomposition [11,12]. In mangrove soils, microbial-mediated reductions of Fe 3+ and SO 4 2-are the main metabolic pathways for soil organic matter decomposition [13,14]. These anaerobic pathways contribute to low decomposition rates and, consequently, to a high accumulation of organic matter in mangrove soils, recognized as natural carbon sinks [12,15]. Additionally, the Fe 3+ and SO 4 2-metabolic pathways release Fe 2+ and sulfides, which may precipitate as pyrite, mackinawite, and acid-volatile sulfides [14,16]. These sulfides represent one of the most stable sinks for potentially toxic elements [17,18]. In this sense, organic matter accumulation and pollutant immobilization are two key services directly controlled by the soils of mangrove forests through their unique soil biogeochemical processes [14,19,20]. In recent decades, the recognition of mangrove forests' relevance has stimulated the restoration of initiatives worldwide, which occurs mainly through seedling plantation [21][22][23].",

Secondary forests (SF) are becoming an extended land use in Costa Rica and many other tropical countries in Central America, due mainly to anthropogenic disturbances such as logging and conversion of forests to agricultural lands (Skole and Tucker, 1993). The SFs are important since they can act as important carbon sinks and may offset C losses resulting from deforestation and land use change. The Neotropical SF varies in relation to the type, intensity and duration of agricultural practices (Fearnside and Guimaraes, 1996;Guariguata and Ostertag, 2001), which affects plant community structure (Fernandes and Sanford, 1995).

While some research information is available on the aboveground biomass accumulation and productivity of commercial tree plantations in Costa Rica and SF (Montagnini, 2000;Russell et al., 2004), data on the SOC pool and its distribution within particle-size aggregates in SF are lacking.

Unfortunately, no SOC pool estimates exist before land use change occurred in the area, although studies conducted in nearby areas as the Sarapiqu\u00ed region in northeastern Costa Rica have reported a SOC pool of 87.1 Mg C ha -1 (Powers, 2004). Therefore our main objective was to quantify the SOC pool and detect its variation in different processes of forest regeneration, as it is expected that forest regrowth leads to positive or negative variations both soil C concentration and pool (Uhl and Jordan, 1984;Hughes et al., 1999;Silver et al., 2000). Soil structure and distribution of size class aggregates can be disrupted by disturbance (Wigginton et al., 2000). Carbon accumulation can be facilitated through the formation of a well soil macro-aggregated structure and it is expected that the age of recovery has an influence in the distribution of soil aggregates and SOC.

A diversity of tree dimensions were recorded and regressed against biomass, including stem diameter at 130 cm (DBH), stem diameter at ground level, stem diameter at 10 cm, stem diameter at 30 cm, total tree height, height of canopy break and mean canopy diameter. DBH was consistently highly correlated with above ground, below ground and total biomass. However, measurements of stem diameters at 0, 10 and 30 cm, and mean canopy diameter often displayed equivalent and at times greater correlation with tree biomass. Multi-species allometric equations were also developed, including 'Mallee growth form' and 'all-eucalypt' regressions. These equations were then applied to field inventory data collected from three locally dominant woodland types and eucalypt dominated environmental plantings to create robust relationships between biomass and stand basal area. This study contributes the predictive equations required to accurately quantify the carbon sequestered in native woodland ecosystems in the low rainfall region of south-western Australia.",
        "57c663a8-864b-44af-9413-cccae8fb09b7": "The recognised biodiversity hotspot of south-western Australia (Mittermeier et al. 2005) has suffered significant levels of biodiversity loss as a result of large-scale land clearing and the on-going pressure from fragmentation of native habitats (Hobbs 1998). The removal of woody vegetation has also exacerbated the expansion of dryland salinity (Eberbach 2003) further endangering the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecological functions of the region (Cramer and Hobbs 2002). The re-establishment of woody vegetation on cleared lands is widely recognised as an effective strategy for ameliorating these negative environmental impacts (Harper et al. 2007;Radford and Bennett 2007). However, markets to fund large-scale conservation focussed on reforestation have been lacking. The emerging market for carbon sequestration may provide a solution. Biosequestration through reforestation is widely recognised as an effective strategy for absorbing atmospheric carbon (IPCC 2003). To date, however, most large-scale reforestation projects have relied on non-native plantation trees harvested for timber products (Conte and Kotchen 2010) often in higher rainfall areas, and generally providing limited benefits to native biodiversity. Such permanent land-use change fails to restore the highly depleted (historically cleared) forest and woodland ecosystems, and the structural and functional attributes they provide (Flynn et al. 2009;Munro et al. 2009). The international carbon markets were estimated in 2007 to be worth US$64 billion (Capoor and Ambrosi 2008). This new market presents a significant opportunity to invest in the restoration of woodland ecosystems for both carbon sequestration, and the many additional services they provide (Bekessy and Wintle 2008;Freudenberger 2010). A significant barrier to attracting investment in this carbon market is the absence of credible, consistent and cost efficient methods for quantifying the carbon sequestered in restored native woodlands.",
        "5539245e-8399-4093-bd72-b19fb8c58d4f": "In contrast, the simplicity of commercial plantation systems, and a history of growth measurement methods for timber production, have resulted in robust and widely accepted techniques for calculating that approach to carbon biosequestration. The primary aim of this research was to develop allometric equations to predict tree biomass from tree dimensional measurements in order to improve the estimation of carbon sequestered and stored in the low rainfall Eucalypt woodlands of south-western Australia. This research also included a collection of stand inventory measurements for use in estimating the carbon carrying capacity of native Eucalypt woodlands. Until now, there were few allometric equations for native 'non-timber' tree species located in low rainfall regions. This has delayed the accurate quantification of carbon carrying capacities for these woodland ecosystems and their potential to sequester carbon (Grierson et al. 2000;Berry et al. 2010). This information gap has also contributed to the delay in investments in reforestation projects that seek to restore native woodland ecosystems for carbon sequestration. This in turn has delayed the restoration of many of the ecological services provided by native vegetation including provision of biodiverse habitats, reduction of soil erosion, filtration of water, and abatement of dryland salinity. Such reforestation projects could substantially benefit the highly cleared and fragmented agricultural zone prevalent in the southwestern region of Western Australia (Harper et al. 2007), while also protecting and buffering the remnant ecosystems within this biodiversity hotspot (Hopper 2009).",

While initial growth rates of plantation species were higher, after four decades productivity of the natural regeneration plots was equal to or greater than productivity of the plantations. For the first 44 years, aboveground biomass of natural regeneration increased at an average annual rate of 3.8 t. ha-1. yr-1, but the last year of the study it was 14.7 t. ha-1. Biomass increment of a pine plantation averaged between 8 and 10.5 t. ha-1. yr-1 except for one year when the rate was much lower, possibly because of hurricane damage. A tropical hardwood plantation averaged close to 4 t. ha-1 .yr-1 for 41 years. It is suggested that in countries where funds for land reclamation are limited, intensive plantations may not always be the best strategy. Natural regeneration or shelterbelt plantations may be suitable alternatives.",

SOC and TN were therefore investigated in 30 field sites comprising natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands. SOC and TN stocks differed and correlated significantly with land use age; the C stocks correlates significantly with land use change compared the TN stocks. However, there was no relation between the C and N stocks with elevation, implying that SOC and TN are solely dependent on land use age. SOC sequestration potentials of the sampled ecosystems were 345.86, 293.19, 266.45, and 251.23 t ha -1 for the natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands with total mean value of 289.18 t\u2022ha -1 (1,060.42 t\u2022ha -1 CO 2-eq). A significant SOC stock loss (17.96%, 29.80%, and 37.66%) occurred in converting natural forests to planted forests, shrub, and grasslands, whereas gains (27.36%, 14.31%, and 5.71%) would occur in reconverting grassland to natural forests, planted forests, and shrublands. Therefore, the C that was lost during deforestation and conversion of natural forests into other land use types could not match the carbon gains thereafter. Our results suggest that land use change and land use age have influenced soil C and N stocks. Moreover, natural forests are better in ecological conservation and restoration of degraded lands. This study provides baseline information for C and N management in ecologically restored and degraded lands.",

The accelerated increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration is expected to cause severe global warming within the 21st century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, 2013), and the mean global temperature is projected to increase between 0.3 and 6.48 \u00b0C by the year 2100 (IPCC, 2007). Similarly, global deposition of reactive N into terrestrial ecosystems is predicted to double by the year 2100 (Galloway et al., 2004). Thus, elevated surface temperature can substantially impact global C budgets and produce positive or negative feedbacks to climate change (Wan et al., 2005) since increase in temperature and nitrogen (N) deposition is occurring with elevated frequency and/or intensity (Alley et al., 2003;Rahmstorf & Coumou, 2011), which may possibly affect carbon (C) and N cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, this trend can be slowed by combining a reduction in anthropogenic CO 2 emissions with the removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere (IPCC, 2013). Existing and potential CO 2 removal (CDR) measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with C \u00a92020. American Geophysical Union.

        "a9232d74-2bac-49fb-88d3-e53b8dab26a1": "The above trend might have resulted from the differences in aboveground structures within the investigated forests since coniferous plantations are known of self-pruning during the transitional stages from the young age to mature age due to canopy closure; as a result, the input of substrates into the forest floor is reduced since SOC and TN were dramatically influenced by litter production, root exudates, and the related bioprocesses (Jian-Fen et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2009). For example, net C stock in soil is reliant on the rate of C addition via plant biomass and/or organic residues against that lost by harvesting, soil and plant respiration, SOM decomposition, soil erosion, and redistribution (Spargo et al., 2008). The SOC concentration was the highest in the natural and planted forests at the medium and the lowest altitudes, but decreased with further increases in elevation, corresponding to Sheikh et al. (2009) who reported lower SOC concentrations in higher elevations in forest soils, and they attributed it to lower tree density and lower litter inputs into soil. The SOC stock peaked at the 3,434 m a.s.l (Table 2), consistent with the observations of (Simon et al., 2018), who had reported the peak values between an altitude of 3,200 and 3,400 m a.s.l in the Himalayas. The consistencies above are attributable to reduced NPP with elevation and reduced input into soils (Djukic et al., 2010) and shallower soils at higher elevations (Becker et al., 2008). In addition, C accumulation is a biproduct of decomposition, which is solely dependent on soil microorganisms, and most soil organisms grow optimally within a temperature range of 25 to 35 \u00b0C and 50% to 75% soil water availability (Parton et al.,  1987). As a result, the anticipated lower temperatures and water content at the higher altitudes above 3,500 m a.s.l would automatically limit microbial activities, SOM decomposition, and thus reduced C accumulation therein.",
        "2fbe8ab7-8046-4ba9-8aed-7dcc5cfc5d98": "Thus, the ecosystem C and N stocks are likely controlled by soil water accessibility in the artificially established and naturally regenerated ecosystems, which supports the statement that plant species composition was shown to be a stronger driver on litter decomposition than climate (De Long et al., 2016) and can as well cause distinct peaks in SOC concentrations in vegetation zones with plants of poor litter quality (Djukic et al., 2010). The decreasing trend in the SOC stock from the forest ecosystems to the grassland along the land use types is in line with Tang et al. (2018) who had recorded mean SOC stocks of 126 \u00b1 98.1 t ha -1 in forests, 60.2 \u00b1 83.2 t ha -1 in shrublands, and 58.4 \u00b1 69.3 t ha -1 in grasslands during a nationwide field-based carbon pools sampling campaign in China. There were conflicting reports on the conversion of forests into other land use types; for example, Powers and Veldkamp (2005) found that mean values of SOC stocks were similar under primary forest (80.5 t ha -1 ) and pasture (76.7 t ha -1 ) across a large region of about 1,400 km 2 in Costa Rica, while Fearnside and Barbosa (1998) had reported that pasture soils in Brazilian Amazonia behave as a net C source with an estimated average release of 12.0 t ha -1 . The above findings demonstrate that disturbances or human-induced management practices have direct implications on forest soil C and N stocks accumulation in artificially established and naturally regenerated ecosystems, but the reverse is also true; that is, the C and N stores becomes much more responsive to even a minor disturbance caused by human activities, since the interaction between natural ecosystems and humans has intensified with increasing human productivity (Vitousek et al., 1997).",

In this study, a manganese spoil dump at Gumgaon, Nagpur in India was reclaimed, using an integrated biotechnological approach (IBA). The physicochemical and microbiological status of the mine land improved after reclamation. Soil organic carbon (SOC) pool increased from 0.104% to 0.69% after 20 years of reclamation in 0-15 cm spoil depth.

In 2004, India's total fossil fuel CO 2 emissions rose 6.3% over the 2003 level, to 366 million metric tons of carbon (Marland et al. 2007). Although India's per capita emission rate of carbon for 2004 is 0.34 metric tons that is well below the global average (1.23 metric tons), proper management of carbon emission is essential from a global perspective. Stabilization of atmospheric concentration of CO 2 to minimize the accelerated greenhouse effect is the current need of the hour. A potential approach to mitigating rising CO 2 concentrations is the enhanced storage or sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems (Paustian et al. 1998;Reichle et al. 1999;Palumbo et al. 2002). Judicious soil management and appropriate land use can minimize the greenhouse effect from agricultural activities by sequestering carbon in soil and enhancing carbon storage within terrestrial ecosystems (Lal 1999). One approach to terrestrial carbon sequestration is to make use of currently underutilized and degraded lands (Akala andLal 2000, 2001;Bendfeldt et al. 2001;Palumbo et al. 2002). Worldwide for example, nearly 2 \u00d7 10 9 ha of lands are considered to be degraded (Oldeman and Vanengelen 1993) and may be capable of sequestrating from 0.8 to 1.3 Gt C/year (Metting et al. 2001). Wasteland statistics indicate that about 63.85 million ha, which account for 20.17% of the total geographical area, exists as wasteland in India. Land degradation is caused by various anthropogenic factors like mining.",

Degraded mine lands are often characterized by acidic pH, low level of key nutrients, poor soil structure, and limited moisture retention capacity (Barnhisel et al. 2000). Despite this fact, degraded mine land shows significant carbon sequestration potential (Akala and Lal 2001). The total land area disturbed by mining in India is around 1,252.13 km 2 , i.e., 0.04% of total geographical area covered. Mining drastically declined the soil organic matter content in soil (Indorante and Boast 1981;Amonette et al. 2003). Thus, reclamation of mine land by soil restoration and reestablishment of vegetative cover could lead to carbon sequestration (Akala and Lal 2000). Terrestrial ecosystems represent two major potential carbon sinks biosphere and pedosphere. Soil organic matter level indicates soil maturity and its formation (Anderson and Domsch 1990;Insam and Domsch 1998). Organic matter in soil is a potential reservoir for carbon storage (Schlesinger 1990;Goudriaan 1995;Paul et al. 1997;Potter and Klooster 1997;Trumbore 1997;Lal 1999;Marland and Schlamadinger 1999;Rosenberg et al. 1999;Rosenzweig and Hillel 2000); in fact, it contains about twice as much carbon as in the atmosphere (Eswaran et al. 2000). As degraded land is characteristically depleted of organic carbon content, progress in these lands can be measured by the return of soil organic carbon (SOC) levels to those seen in undisturbed or otherwise similar soils (Amonette et al. 2003). In the present study, mine-degraded land was reclaimed using an integrated biotechnological approach (IBA;Juwarkarc et al. 1993).

Biomass can be estimated by direct method, i.e., destructive techniques or by indirect method, i.e., developing an allometric relationships. Destructive techniques for biomass estimation are time consuming and expensive due to the large dimensions and amounts of biomass that have to be processed [11,12]. Allometric relationship yields a non-destructive and indirect measurement of biomass components and is often the preferred approach since it is less time consuming and less expensive than direct measurements [13]. The use of allometric relationships for biomass estimation is a basic prerequisite in the study of global carbon balance and carbon sequestration. Global climate change has inspired an increasing interest of scientific and political communities in the study of global carbon storage and carbon balance [14,15]. Several 'no regret' policies and forest management practices were considered to address the impacts of climate change [16].

In addition to providing a range of products that people need including building materials, firewood, tannins, fodder and herbal medicines (FAO, 1994;Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2000), mangroves are of invaluable local and global ecologic, environmental and social importance. Mangroves serve as breeding grounds for many species of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and birds (Taylor et al., 2003;Nagelkerken et al., 2007). Being at the edge of the sea, mangroves protect shoreline from coastal erosion (Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2005;Mazda et al., 2006). The world mangrove forests have been valued at approximately US $181 billions (Costanza et al., 1997). Despite their great value, mangroves have one of the highest rates of degradation of any global habitat-exceeding 1% of mangrove area per year (Valiela et al., 2001;FAO, 2005). Over-exploitation, clear-cutting and pollution are amongst the major causes for decline (Farnsworth and Ellison, 1997;Alongi, 2002), but also erroneous estimates of the 'health' or ecological condition of mangroves may prove detrimental and may undermine the functionality of mangrove forests in a hidden way (Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2005). This has led to the realistic prospect of a world without mangroves (Duke et al., 2007). Hence, rehabilitation and sustainable utilization of mangrove resources is an international conservation priority. Some 540 km 2 of mangroves occurs along the Kenyan coast, much of it in Lamu district (Kairo et al., 2002).",

It is estimated that along the Kenyan coast, 70% of wood requirement is met by mangroves (Wass, 1995). Increased demand of mangrove wood products, particularly for firewood and building poles, has led to degradation of the forest in many areas along the coast (Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2000;Abuodha and Kairo, 2001). One of Kenya's forest development objectives for the year 2000 and beyond is: 'to increase the forest and tree cover in order to ensure an increasing supply of forest products and services to meet the basic needs of the present and future generations and for enhancing the role of forestry in socio-economic development' (MENR, 1994). This objective cannot be realized unless concerted efforts to reforest degraded forests are made. From the viewpoint of rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas in Kenya, a program of replanting mangroves was initiated at Gazi Bay in October 1991 (Kairo, 1995;Kairo et al., 2001). Since the date of planting is known, these plantations offer a rare opportunity to determine how stand structures develops with increasing age of mangrove forests. For majority of mangrove studies worldwide, biomass and productivity has been estimated in natural stands (e.g. Komiyama et al., 1987;Saintilan, 1997;Komiyama et al., 2007). Only in Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia do we find biomass and productivity estimates for replanted mangrove stands (Putz and Chan, 1986;Ong et al., 1995).

The carbon sequestration was 90-folds higher in soil and 9890-folds greater in both tree biomass and soil than that in control site. Hence, mangrove planting had an extraordinary potential for carbon sequestration in barren areas. The carbon sequestration and storage increased with increasing levels of silt, clay, moisture and nutrients (N, S, Cu, K, P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Mg) in the mangrove soil. In contrast, the carbon sequestration and storage reduced with increasing levels of temperature, pore-water salinity, pH, bulk density and sand in the mangrove soil.

The mangrove forests account for only 1% (13.5 Gt year -1 ) of carbon sequestration by the world's forests, but they account for 14% of carbon sequestration by the global ocean (Alongi, 2012). They supply more than 10% of the organic carbon, essential to the world oceans (Dittmar et al., 2006). Carbon sequestration in the global mangroves is estimated to be 14.2 TgC yr -1 and its value per unit area is 1.71 \u00b1 0.17 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 (Alongi, 2018). The Indian Sundarbans has the capacity to sequester a total of 2.79 TgC in its natural forest area of 4264 km 2 (Ray and Jana, 2017). However, the potential of planted mangroves on carbon sequestration is far from clear. Mangrove forests are globally significant carbon sinks, storing carbon in a range of 455-856 mega-gram in one hectare of forest and 6.2-11.7 peta-gram in the world (Alongi, 2020;Kauffman et al., 2020;Ouyang and Lee, 2020). The mangrove forests store four-folds higher carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests in the tropics (Donato et al., 2011), and they also have larger carbon stock in tropics (895 \u00b1 90 MgC.ha -1 ) than sub-tropics (547 \u00b1 66 MgC.ha -1 ) (Sanders et al., 2016). The mangrove forests hold the highest carbon stock in Asia-Pacific (1094 Mg C ha -1 ), followed by Latin America (939 Mg C ha -1 ), West Central Africa (799 Mg C ha -1 ), and Arabian/Oman Gulf (217 Mg C ha -1 ) (Kauffman and Bhomia, 2017).",
        "930018a3-d8de-43bb-90dd-e8e438fc0e2b": "However, there is severe lack of spatial data for the global mangroves, and hence it is necessary to collect regionwise data for better understanding on the role of mangroves as carbon sink (Taillardat et al., 2018). Mangroves are known to store carbon by four-folds higher than the degraded or deforested ones, by three-folds higher than the mangroves impacted by domestic or aquaculture effluents, and by two-folds higher than the mangroves affected by storms and flood (Perez et al., 2018). Mangrove loss leads to emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere resulting in global warming (Alongi, 2012). Hence, conservation and restoration of carbon-rich mangrove forests have received due attention for mitigating the climate change (Macreadie et al., 2019). Mangroves are highly productive, storing large amounts of carbon in their soil system over a long period of time due to high sedimentation rates and anoxic soils (Donato et al., 2011;Atwood et al., 2017;Alongi, 2018). The mangrove soil is reported to account for 76.5% of total carbon in ecosystem (Alongi, 2014(Alongi, , 2020) ) and to store carbon in a range of 2.6-6.4 PgC in the top metre of soil (Jardine and Siikamaki, 2014;Atwood et al., 2017;Sanderman et al., 2018). The mangrove soil is more efficient in carbon burial by 2.4-folds than salt marshes, by 5.2-folds than seagrasses, and by 4-fold than in tropical forests.",
        "f96d74f6-59cf-45a5-91c1-09ff23ab0dc7": "Several reports have appeared in recent years on the carbon stocks of mangroves in India (Ray et al., 2011(Ray et al., , 2013;;Kathiresan et al., 2013Kathiresan et al., , 2014;;Pandey and Pandey, 2013;Sumana et al., 2015;Sahu et al., 2016;Bhomia et al., 2016;Suresh et al., 2017). But, works on carbon sequestration for specific mangrove species are far from clear. Moreover, Indian works are much focused on mangrove biomass carbon rather than soil carbon. This soil carbon is also determined mostly on surface layer of the soil, instead of 1 m soil depth as recommended for mangroves (Kauffman and Donato, 2012). It is still not clear about the extent to which carbon storage potential varies with age of mangrove forests (Romain et al., 2018). To fill the knowledge gaps, the present investigation was made with an objective of assessing the carbon storage and sequestration potential in planted mangrove stands of Avicennia marina at different age groups as influenced by vegetation and soil characteristics.",
        "fabef5e2-11ca-457c-9fb8-3ed217c1e625": "Mangrove stands exhibited remarkable potential for carbon storage. On an average, total carbon in both tree biomass and soil was 60.27 MgC.ha -1 in the planted stands, while it was only 1.07 \u00b1 0.01 Mg C ha -1 in non-planted site. In other words, total carbon was 56-folds greater due to mangrove plantation. Total carbon was dependent on the carbon stock of tree biomass and soil with positive correlation coefficient of 0.98 and 0.76 respectively (Table 1). The total carbon was also dependent on vegetative characteristics such as dbh, AGB, BGB, AGB/BGB ratio,  tree biomass and tree height as evident by high correlation coefficient values (Table 2). This is further evident by the loading plot of principal component analysis (PCA), which shows narrow angles between total carbon and vegetation characteristics, indicating positive correlation (Fig. 2). Moreover, the carbon storage increased with age and growth of mangrove stands, similar to earlier reports (Sharma et al., 2017;Kauffman and Bhomia, 2017). AGB is efficient in holding carbon with the global means of carbon storage (78 Mg C ha -1 ) and sequestration (2.9 Mg C ha -1 ) (Estrada and Soares, 2017). In the present study, AGB carbon was 21.96 Mg C ha -1 in the planted mangrove stand and this value is comparatively lower than earlier reports (Table 1,6). Whereas BGB carbon was 13.79 Mg C ha -1 in the planted mangrove stand (Table 1), and this value is higher than that previously reported for the same species in Indian Sundarbans (Ray et al., 2011). Total carbon increased with increasing AGB/BGB ratio of planted mangrove stand as evident by a positive correlation of 0.99. The ratio varied from 1.36 to 1.7 in the planted stand of different age groups (Table 2).",

Similar to the present data, AGB is known to be greater than BGB (Kathiresan et al., 2013;Sahu et al., 2016). In earlier studies, BGB is reported to be 19% of AGB (Alongi, 2009), 26% of AGB (Suresh et al., 2017) and 55.3% of AGB (Romain et al., 2018), but in the present study the BGB was as high as 63% of AGB. The higher BGB indicates an adaptative feature of the mangroves in accumulating root biomass for anchorage and survival in wet and soft mud (Kathiresan et al., 2013). Soil moisture is known to increase BGB through enhancing the cambial activity induced by ethylene production (Yamamoto et al., 1995). However, AGB and BGB differ greatly among the mangrove species, plant density and ecology depending upon the geographical locations (Sahu et al., 2016). Carbon storage is low in the present work as compared to earlier records (Table 6). This low carbon holding can be attributed to shorter stands of planted mangroves as evident by tree heights of 2.19 m and tree diameter (dbh) of 4.07 cm, and these values are lower than earlier reports in the same present study area with taller trees of 4.29 m height and dbh of 9.34 cm (Kathiresan et al., 2013). Moreover, different allometric equations are used by research workers for biomass assessments thereby making it difficult to compare the data of different areas.",

In other words, the soil carbon was 22-folds higher due to mangrove planting. The soil carbon also increased from 15.58 to 27.83 MgC.ha -1 with plantation age of 17 and 27.2 years respectively (Table 1). This increase is similar to that in the peninsular Malaysia, where the mangrove soil carbon has increased from 16% in 5 year old forest to 27% in 85 year old forest (Alongi et al., 2004). The soil carbon varied from 15.58 to 27.83 Mg C ha -1 in Avicennia stand of different age groups (Table 1), and this falls in the range of 16.43-22.37 MgC.ha -1 as reported earlier for the Avicennia-dominated forest of Indian Sundarbans (Ray et al., 2013). However, the present value is relatively lower than previous reports (Table 6). Mangrove soil constitutes a large fraction of carbon stock. The mangroves are reported to sequester 49%-98% of total carbon, mainly in the soil at >30 cm depth in the Indo-Pacific region (Donato et al., 2011). Similarly, the soil carbon contributes as much as 86% of total carbon in western central Africa (Kauffman and Bhomia, 2017), 76.5% in global mangroves (Alongi, 2014(Alongi, , 2020)), 69.7% in French Guiana (Romain et al., 2018) and 64% in Bhitarkanika mangroves of India (Bhomia et al., 2016). However, the present study recorded only low holding of 39% of total carbon in the soil.",
        "a3e076ff-5877-4885-a93f-50d3c16edff1": "Soil nutrients and their availability are important for mangrove growth, biomass and carbon storage potential ( (Boto et al., 1984); e.g. Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001). Soil organic carbon content is reported to be much related to soil nutrients rather than to pH, bulk density and other soil factors in the mangroves of China (Huang et al., 2018). Among soil nutrients, nitrogen showed a strong positive correlation with total carbon content in the planted mangrove stand (Table 4). Majority of soil N is present in organic forms, which are microbially transformed into inorganic N in the form of ammonium and nitrate, and these are then utilized by mangrove plants to maintain high primary production and carbon accumulation in the mangrove stand (Alongi et al., 2002). In the present study, the mangrove soil was rich in iron as evident by its grey colour produced by reduced Fe due to water saturation in the soil during high tide (Lang Martins Madi et al., 2016). Availability of soil phosphorus (P) depends on soil oxygen and Fe. P binds to Fe in the presence of oxygen, but under anoxic conditions P does not bind with Fe thereby releasing P for plant uptake (Holmer et al., 1994). This higher availability of P facilitates better growth of mangroves and carbon storage (Boto et al., 1984). Soil carbon content is dependent on soil particle size. Fine particles of silt and clay with greater surface areas are responsible for accumulation of carbon and nutrients, whereas the sand particles with larger surface areas store only lesser contents (Kathiresan et al., 2014;Kauffman and Bhomia, 2017). This is in agreement with the present observation that planted mangrove soil with high silt and clay had high levels of carbon and nutrients (Tables 1,3,4). This is also evident by the loading plots of PCA, which exhibit small angles between total carbon and soil nutrients, indicating positive correlation (Fig. 4).",
        "dce3a6d5-fad7-428a-8c53-5d840d3cc0b4": "4). Avicennia marina is reported to be sensitive to increasing soil salinity and temperature (Ray et al., 2011). The planted soil had pore-water salinity as high as 48.54 ppt in the present work (Table 3) due to lack of freshwater input and improper tidal flushing (Kathiresan, 2000). This is one of the reasons for low production and carbon stock of the mangrove planted stand. This is also evident by loading plot of PCA, which shows large angles close to 180 0 between total carbon stock and the soil temperature or pore-water salinity revealing negative correlation (Table 3; Fig. 3). Tree height typically decreases with increasing salinity and decreasing nutrient availability. High salinity may interfere with nutrient availability especially P to mangrove plants (Lugo, 1989). The nutrient availability and pore-water salinity are the potentially important factors that may regulate organic matter production, thereby determining the carbon stocks of mangrove systems (Sanders et al., 2016). Mangrove planting altered the soil properties (Tables 3,4). The mangrove roots increase soil porosity and water holding capacity, and reduce soil compaction, as a result of biological activity and organic matter deposited in the mangrove soil (Bhomia et al., 2016). Hence the soil carbon showed negative correlation with bulk density in the present work (Fig. 3), which is similar to earlier work in China (Huang et al., 2018). The mangrove stand of Rhizophora mucronata is shown to increase in soil organic matter, total nitrogen and soil redox potential, and to decrease in soil temperature. This mangrove stand is also demonstrated to attain forest maturity at 11th year of plantation (Salmo et al., 2013). A  Mangrove planted stand exhibited extraordinary potential for carbon sequestration as compared to non-planted site.",

In other words, total carbon sequestration was 9890-fold greater due to mangrove plantation. Hence, mangrove restoration is recommended through planting in suitable intertidal areas for improving carbon sequestration potential. Total carbon sequestration is lower in the present study (Table 5) than the global estimate of 1.71 MgC ha -1 yr -1 (Alongi, 2018) and 1.702 MgC ha -1 yr -1 for Indian mangroves (Ray et al., 2011). The low sequestration can be attributed to mangrove biodiversity: the present work confined to a single species A. marina, instead of multiple species of mangroves as in the other works. Generally the mixed mangrove stands have 20% higher soil carbon stocks per unit area than the monotypic stands (Atwood et al., 2017;Perez et al., 2018). Moreover, total carbon sequestration estimated in the present work was not comprehensive, as it did not include the carbon sequestration of soil microbes, benthic flora and fauna, and their functional role. Our earlier work has recorded a very high carbon sequestration rate of 4.8 Mg C ha -1 .yr -1 in live biomass, when calculated this by dividing the tree carbon with age of plantation (Kathiresan et al., 2013). But the value of carbon sequestration was low in the present work, when determined it in terms of annual accrual of live biomass carbon subtracted by the carbon loss due to annual litter fall. In the present study, live biomass contributed to 99.1% of total carbon sequestration, whereas soil contributed to the least (0.9%) in the planted mangrove stand.",

On the contrary, mangrove soil is reported to sequester 2.6 folds higher amount of carbon (72.3%) than plants (27.7%) in arid and dry mangroves of Gujarat, India (Pandey and Pandey, 2013). Carbon sequestration in tree biomass was estimated at 0.98 Mg C ha -1 .yr -1 in planted mangrove stand of different age groups (Table 5). This value is lower than that of 1.69 Mg C. ha -1 .yr -1 for Indian Sundarbans (Ray et al., 2011), but it is higher than the previous record of 0.23 MgC ha -1 yr -1 in the planted sites of A. marina (Suresh et al., 2017). This earlier work has also found that growth rate of mangrove species is not proportional to biomass and carbon sequestration. For instance, the growth rate is higher (7.3 mm.yr -1 ) in A. marina than that (2.95 mm.yr -1 ) in Rhizophora mucronata, but the tree biomass accumulation rate is similar in both the species: 0.45 Mg ha -1 yr -1 in A. marina, 0.5 MgC ha -1 yr -1 in R. mucronata, and the carbon sequestration rate in the tree biomass is also similar: 0.23 \u00b1 0.3 and 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 MgC ha -1 yr -1 respectively in the two mangrove species (Suresh et al., 2017).",

The carbon sequestration increased with age of mangrove plantation (Table 5). This finding is in accordance with earlier reports. Carbon accumulation is shown to increase from 5 to 8.4 Mg C ha -1 .yr -1 with age from 4 to 10 year old plantations of Sonneratia apetala in South China (Ren et al., 2010). Similarly, carbon sequestration is reported to increase from 1.05 to 8.09 Mg C ha -1 .yr -1 from 1 to 17.5 year old plantations of Avicenna marina in south India (Kathiresan et al., 2013). On the contrary, plant carbon sink is reported to decline with age of mangroves, while soil carbon sequestration rate remains constant in the mangroves of French Guiana (Romain et al., 2018). Soil conditions had significant influence on total carbon sequestration. The total carbon sequestration decreased with increasing soil temperature, pore-water salinity and soil sand content, but increased with soil nutrients in the planted mangrove stand (Tables 3,4) as evident by correlation and PCA analyses (Figs. 6,7). This is in accordance with our previous reports, that high temperature and high salinity in the soil have negative impact on carbon sequestration potential of mangroves, whereas the levels of nutrients have positive impact (Kathiresan et al., 2013(Kathiresan et al., , 2014)). In addition to nutrient availability and soil salinity, annual rainfall is the main driving force for carbon sequestration potential (Sanders et al., 2016).",

Carbon sequestration in mangroves is influenced by climatic factors such as temperature and evapo-transpiration, coastal oceanographic process such as tidal amplitude, current and geomorphology (Alongi, 2018). The soil carbon sequestration varies with mangrove types and hydrological disturbance. It is higher in riverine mangroves than that in fringe and basin mangroves. The mangroves in hydrologically disturbed tidal creek is known to sequester less carbon than those in undisturbed creek, as proved in Southwest Florida, USA (Daniel et al., 2016). Changes in resource availability and environmental constraints are also reported to be the causes of change in carbon sequestration. This is proved in Indian Sundarbans that annual increase in carbon stocks is affected due to the increasing stress factors such as salinity and pH and the reduced resource availability by increasing lighter wooded species with low tree diameter over heavier wood species (Ray et al., 2011). The present study recorded high salinity of 48.54 ppt in soil pore-water of the mangrove stands (Table 3). This high salinity may interfere with nutrient availability to mangroves, and alternatively addition of nutrients may enhance performance of mangroves for growth, biomass and carbon gain under saline conditions (Ball and Sobrado, 1999). This is experimentally proved that the addition of P to dwarf mangroves of Rhizophora mangle in the field has resulted in significant increase in growth (Feller, 1995).",

However, there is concern amongst ecologists that these markets will promote the establishment of monoculture plantations rather than more diverse restoration plantings, on the assumption that fast-growing monocultures are likely to store more carbon than restoration plantings. We examined the validity of this assumption for three predominantly rainforest plantation types established in the moist tropical uplands of northeast Australia: monoculture plantations of native rainforest conifers (n = 5, mean age 13 years); mixed species plantations of rainforest cabinet timber species, rainforest conifers and eucalypts (n = 5, mean age 13 years); and, environmental restoration plantings comprised mostly of a diverse range of rainforest trees (n = 10, mean age 14 years). We found that restoration plantings stored significantly more carbon in above-ground biomass than monoculture plantations of native conifers (on average, 106 t vs 62 t carbon per ha); and tended to store more carbon than mixed species timber plantations which were intermediate in value (86 t carbon per ha). Carbon stocks were higher in restoration plantings than in monoculture and mixed species plantations for three reasons. First, and most importantly, restoration plantings were more densely stocked than monoculture and mixed species plantations. Second, there were more large diameter trees in restoration plantings than monoculture plantations. Third, the trees used in restoration plantings had a higher average wood density than the conifers used in monoculture plantations. While, on average, wood density was higher in mixed species plantations than restoration plantings, the much higher stocking rate of restoration plantings meant they stored more carbon than mixed species plantations. We conclude that restoration plantings in the moist tropics of north-east Australia can accumulate relatively high amounts of carbon within two decades of establishment. Comparison with reference rainforest sites suggests that restoration plantings could maintain their high stocking rates (and therefore high biomass) as they develop in future decades.",

In the Australian context, for example, it has been estimated that broadscale tree plantations could sequester a high proportion of national carbon dioxide emissions (CSIRO 2009). However, there is concern amongst some ecologists that markets for carbon offsets will promote the establishment of fast-growing monoculture plantations rather than more diverse and structurally complex environmental plantings, resulting in poor outcomes for biodiversity (Bekessy & Wintle 2008;Hunt 2008;Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists 2009). In part, this concern stems from a commonly held assumption that plantations will accumulate carbon more rapidly than diverse environmental plantings, because plantations are primarily designed and managed to maximise fibre production (e.g. by utilising trees selected for rapid growth, planted at optimum spacings, fertilised, and with control of weeds and other competitors: Australian Greenhouse Office 2006). In this paper, we present data on carbon stored in above-ground biomass (AGB: live trees, dead trees and woody debris) by environmental plantings, mixed species cabinet timber plantations and monoculture plantations in the moist tropical uplands of north-east Australia. AGB develops rapidly following reforestation, comprises the majority of tree biomass (around 75% in moist forests: Snowdon et al. 2000) and is much easier to measure than carbon stocks in root biomass and soil (Brown 2002;Snowdon et al. 2002;Woodbury et al. 2007). The study takes advantage of recently published allometric equations for estimating the AGB of tropical forest trees, derived from an extensive, pantropical dataset (Chave et al. 2005). In particular, we address the following questions. First, how rapidly do reforestation projects in the study region accumulate carbon in AGB?

Three stands (afforested in 1990, 1983, and 1968)  were selected for detailed analysis of the carbon sequestration. Soil profiles were sampled in these stands in 2005. Radiocarbon analysis combined with a simple model of litter production was used to differentiate between plant-derived recent carbon and carbon stemming from fragments of oil shale. Total carbon accumulated since afforestation in vegetation, forest floor, and A horizon was 7.8 t\u00c1ha -1 in the stand established in 1990, 34.5 t\u00c1ha -1 in that established in 1983, and 133.4 t\u00c1ha -1 in that established in 1968. Most of the sequestered carbon was allocated to tree stems; their portion increasing with age from 28% to 51%.

Mining activities raze the initial vegetation and cause large-scale disturbances of soil, resulting in carbon losses. In fact, the carbon content of mine spoils is usually very low (Shrestha and Lal 2006); therefore, soils developing on mine spoils can act as important sinks for CO 2 through accumulation of biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) (Ussiri and Lal 2005). However, the carbon budget of ecosystems emerging on former mining areas is poorly understood (Shrestha and Lal 2006). A deeper understanding could lead to ecosystem restoration practices that maximize carbon accumulation. Plantations established on spoils are useful sites to study factors affecting carbon sequestration in forests, as the history of the stands is typically well documented and species composition is usually homogeneous across a wide area. Thus, differences in the carbon content among stands of different age are a good proxy for carbon accumulation. However, in many instances, mine soils contain a substantial amount of fossil carbon, which obfuscates estimation of carbon sequestration. Measurement of radiocarbon activity has been used to differentiate between plant-derived recent carbon and fossil carbon (Rumpel et al. 1999(Rumpel et al. , 2003;;Morgenroth et al. 2004;Fettweis et al. 2005), although no definitive methodology has been developed. The lack of an accepted method for quantifying fossil carbon decreases the reliability of measured rates of SOC accumulation (Ussiri and Lal 2005) and complicates the comparison of results obtained in different studies. In large-scale assessments of forest carbon stocks, tree biomass is often calculated based on forest inventory data, which account for only merchantable stem wood and leave other tree biomass components either omitted or estimated from constant ratios (e.g., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2003). Such estimates may be biased, since stem biomass contributes significantly less to total biomass in young forests than in mature forests (Peichl and Arain 2006).",
        "459ba4d6-1904-44f3-8076-f49ee41f405f": "It has been suggested that changes in allocation and biomass distribution with age can be responsible, at least partly, for the observed decline in tree production after canopy closure (Kira and Shidei 1967;Magnani et al. 2000;Ryan et al. 2004). Carbon allocation may also affect the soil carbon cycle, since decomposition rates differ for plant organs (Gower et al. 1997). Therefore, knowledge of changes in biomass distribution during stand development is necessary to model carbon dynamics and assess carbon stocks. Estonia is home to the world's largest commercially exploited oil shale deposits, and opencast oil shale mining has degraded about 130 km 2 of land. Since the spoil of opencast oil shale mining is extremely coarse and depleted in nutrients and organic matter, afforestation is considered the most suitable reclamation option for these areas (Vaus 1970). Earlier studies have described the pedogenesis and SOC accumulation on oil shale mine spoil (Reintam andKaar 1999, 2002;Reintam et al. 2002;Reintam 2004), but there are no estimates of total carbon stocks of reclaimed forest ecosystems. Since Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands dominate the afforested areas, we chose this species to investigate carbon dynamics in developing forest ecosystems. Specifically, the aims of this study were (i) to estimate the rate of carbon accumulation in young Scots pine plantations growing on severely degraded land (mine spoil), (ii) to determine the distribution of sequestered carbon along forest ecosystem partitions, and (iii) to develop a simple and robust method for finding the recent carbon contribution to total SOC.",
        "34224e41-c826-4047-b6c8-2a76cbd0b1a8": "Several methods have been used to study the carbon balance of ecosystems developing on reclaimed mine spoils (Shrestha and Lal 2006). We used the chronosequence approach, which is based on the assumption that sampled stands of different age represent the developmental stages of a forest. The use of chronosequences is considered the most feasible option to study long-term changes in forests over the short term (e.g., Wang et al. 2003). However, this method is not a panacea, since other factors also vary among sites (Yanai et al. 2003). In the Narva opencast the substrate is very heterogenic (Vaus 1970;Kuznetsova and Mandre 2006). We overcame this problem by selecting many (13) sample plots with small age gaps for biomass assessment; thus, the sampling plots reflected the average productivity of pine plantations in this area. Three stands where carbon pools were studied in detail were situated in close proximity, and the relationship between basal area and stand age of these stands was near to the average of all sampled plantations. Despite seemingly adverse growing conditions, tree biomasses of young Scots pine plantations in the Narva opencast were comparable to or higher than that of several other Scots pine stands of the same age, growing in similar climate but on undisturbed soils (Ma \u00a8lko \u00a8nen 1974; Ilvesniemi and Liu 2001;Helmisaari et al. 2002;Kolari et al. 2004). This is in accordance with the conclusion reached by Kuznetsova and Mandre (2006) that concentrations of major nutrients in the soil of the Narva opencast are sufficient for pine growth. Our tree biomass measurements were incomplete, since we did not measure the biomass of fine roots (<2 mm), but other studies on Scots pine have shown that most of the belowground biomass rests in stumps and coarse roots, and the share of fine roots from the total tree biomass in 10-to 50year-old stands varies from <1% to 15% (Vanninen et al.",
        "5df2110c-921c-485b-bc68-28c608a4573e": "1996;Ilvesniemi and Liu 2001;Helmisaari et al. 2002;Xiao and Ceulemans 2004) and decreases with age (Vanninen et al. 1996;Helmisaari et al. 2002). Measured values of fine root biomasses in young Scots pine forests range from 1.5 to 4 t\u00c1ha -1 (Makkonen and Helmisaari 1998;Oleksyn et al. 1999;Vanninen and Ma \u00a8kela \u00a81999;Helmisaari et al. 2002). Stem biomass exhibited the largest portion of the total tree biomass. Its contribution increased with age, but 21 years after stand establishment, stem biomass still accounted for only 54% of total tree biomass. This demonstrates that ignoring other biomass pools in forest carbon stock estimations may underestimate the tree biomass in young stands by as much as 50%. Since soils in restored oil shale opencasts also contain fragments of carbon-containing oil shale, the measurements of soil TOC overestimate real carbon sequestration. To solve this problem, we used radiocarbon analysis to obtain the contribution of plant-derived recent carbon in TOC, considering that the 14 C content of the soil depends on the amount of recent carbon and the time period it entered soil, which determines its 14 C activity (pMC recent ). Our approach was similar to the one developed by Rumpel et al. (2003) who calculated pMC recent in mine soils by combining a model for the turnover of soil organic matter with the record of atmospheric 14 C activity. They found that modelled SOC dynamics had rather little impact on the pMC recent values. This supports our simplified assumption that age distribution of recent SOC depends only on the litter production over time, which in turn is related to changes in stand biomass. This simplification was also supported by the fact that calculated radiocarbon activities for recent carbon were the same as that measured for forest floor horizons that contain only plant-derived carbon.",
        "fb62d7d2-5252-4aa0-9e0a-961ec7114de9": "Although the power regression model that was used for calculating tree biomass and litterfall has the advantage of determining residuals based on relative deviation, it predicts unrealistically a never-ending increase in biomass with age. A logistic fit, in contrast, attains a maximum biomass with increasing age, but bases its fit on absolute deviations. The logistic regression model (Fig. 2) resulted in a slightly greater 14 C activity of recent carbon than the power regres-sion model, e.g., about 2% for the oldest stand, most of which is attributable to the first decade of regrowth. However, the logistic model predicted only a 75-fold net increase in total biomass, suggesting the model is likely overestimating biomass in the earlier years. Although the logistic model is likely more realistic for older aged stands, the lack of contrast in atmospheric radiocarbon activity results in a negligible effect on the estimate of pMC recent . Because atmospheric 14 C was greatest when the tree biomass (and therefore litterfall) was low, the choice of model had little influence on the 14 C activity estimates. As our results demonstrate, soils in the Narva mine contain considerable amounts of recent carbon beneath the A horizon also. Considering that overburden is placed selectively into heaps in the Narva opencast, this recent carbon may originate (at least partly) from peat and soil from premining ecosystems. Since it was not possible to differentiate carbon that had accumulated after afforestation from the carbon from the previous ecosystem, we omitted the recent carbon in the C horizon from estimations of total soil and ecosystem carbon sequestration. Therefore, the rate of carbon accumulation in our stands is probably underestimated. Furthermore, the number of stands is too small to draw conclusions for a wider area, but our work can provide insight into the role of soils in total stand carbon sequestration following afforestation. The rate of soil development depends on the parent substrate. Reintam (2004) has suggested that high contents of coarse fractions and fragments of oil shale in mine spoil inhibit humus accumulation.",
        "2c48b41f-93bf-408d-9a62-a8d1b038fb50": "Our second detailed-study stand, which was reclaimed in 1983, exhibited the lowest geogenic carbon content in the C horizon. The percentage of >2 mm fractions in that stand was also low. However, the A horizon that had developed in about 20 years in stand 2 was very thin (up to 0.5 cm). Reintam et al. (2002) measured 5 cm thick A horizons under 18-and 20-year-old pine stands growing in the Narva opencast. Perhaps slow soil development in the second detailed-study stand can be attributed to poor ground vegetation, which is extremely important for humus formation (Reintam et al. 2002). Additional research is needed to determine the factors affecting the rate of carbon sequestration in highly heterogenic soils created by opencast oil shale mining. The average annual increase in carbon in the oldest detailed-study stand was 0.33 t\u00c1ha -1 \u00c1year -1 in the forest floor and 0.51 t\u00c1ha -1 \u00c1year -1 in the A horizon. These values are within the range of rates obtained by Reintam et al. (2002), who studied soil formation under Scots pine stands planted in the Narva oil shale opencast 29-34 years ago. They estimated carbon sequestration up to 1.74 t\u00c1ha -1 \u00c1year -1 for the combined forest floor and humus horizon and 2.38 t\u00c1ha -1 \u00c1year -1 for the whole soil profile (including AC horizon); the amount of recent carbon in mineral soil was found by subtracting the content of organic carbon in spoil from the %TOC in upper soil horizons (A and AC). This entailed the assumption that mine spoil initially contains only geogenic carbon. However, if some of the organic carbon in spoil originates from premining soil, this method underestimates the real SOC accretion. Comparable rates of SOC accumulation were also observed under alder plantations on reclaimed coal mine heaps in the Czech Republic (S \u02c7ourkova \u00b4et al.",
        "024c3293-f01d-4112-af12-f5c0df2d7540": "2005). Compared with our results, the rate of soil carbon sequestration was higher in a lignite mine in Germany afforested with Scots pine, to which 50 t\u00c1ha -1 new carbon was already added to the soil in less than 40 years (Rumpel et al. 1999;Fettweis et al. 2005). In Ohio (USA), the estimated rate of SOC accumulation in afforested coal mine was as high as 2.3 t\u00c1ha -1 \u00c1year -1 for the 0-15 cm soil depth during the first 20 years after reclamation (Akala and Lal 2001). However, the climate in Ohio is warmer and moister than in Estonia; therefore, biomass as well as litter production and decomposition are probably higher there than at our sites. There are few publications providing concurrent estimates of change in biomass and soil carbon stocks following afforestation in degraded land. In plantations in Europe and North America established on former agricultural lands, about 70%-100% of the added carbon is allocated to tree biomass (Richter et al. 1999;Hooker and Compton 2003;Thuille and Schulze 2006;Ouimet et al. 2007;Vesterdal et al. 2007), in accordance with our results. Mineral soils on former arable lands and especially grasslands may even lose carbon after afforestation (Guo and Gifford 2002;Paul et al. 2002;Thuille and Schulze 2006). Since mine spoils typically contain little organic carbon, SOC sequestration potential should be substantial until a new steady state between litter input and decomposition is reached. In our 36-year-old Scots pine plantation growing on a reclaimed oil shale opencast, the recent carbon stock of the A horizon comprised 14% and forest floor 9% of the ecosystem total carbon pool. This shows that soils contribute significantly to carbon accumulation during early forest succession on degraded land.",
        "0bf9cece-32ea-48d3-a331-faa35de58aa2": "This shows that soils contribute significantly to carbon accumulation during early forest succession on degraded land. The relative contributions of forest floor and mineral soil to total soil carbon sequestration vary greatly among sites and depend on climate, soil type, tree species, former agricultural land use, and sampling methodology (Vesterdal et al. 2007). Stand age might also be an important factor, as we found that the average rate of SOC accretion was higher in the forest floor than in the mineral soil two decades after afforestation in stand 2, whereas recent carbon storage in the A horizon already exceeded the forest floor carbon stock in the 36-year-old stand. Similar patterns were also observed by Rumpel et al. (1999) under pine stands in the Lusatian lignite mining district in Germany. On the other hand, other studies conducted in the same mining district and under the same species exhibit contrasting results. Rumpel et al. (2003) estimated that the O horizons contained 70% of the total SOC pool in the 32-year-old Scots pine stand (in which the mineral soil was sampled to a depth of 5 cm), and Fettweis et al. (2005) found even higher forest floor contribution for a stand established 37 years ago -87% of the accumulated SOC was partitioned in the forest floor and only 13% in the topsoil (0-10 cm). The factors affecting carbon distribution in soils deserve more attention to identify management practices increasing carbon allocation to mineral soil, which is considered a more permanent carbon pool than forest floor (Jandl et al. 2007).",

They are the largest, complex, and self-regenerating natural resources. They are considered important for their unique role as major carbon sinks because of their capability to capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus, maintaining forest biomass and sequestration potential is dependent on maintaining forests. However, structure and function of forest ecosystems are changing drastically due to various anthropogenic activities. Forest degradation and deforestation have direct impact on biomass and carbon pool. These activities have altered the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere thereby impacting climate and weather conditions, biodiversity, food production, and human health. Several studies have reported that carbon storage in forests are directly regulated by composition, age, site characteristics, succession, and climatic variation (Chen et al. 2005;Waring and Running 2007;Gough et al. 2008;Goward et al. 2008). The amount of carbon sequestered by a forest can be estimated from the biomass accumulated and such database is important for many national developments planning pertaining to productivity and carbon budget. An increase of 0.65-1.06 C temperature was reported in the fifth assessment report of International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Hence, emphasis was given on control of emission and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. Remote sensing and GIS have been used for rapid and consistent assessments of above ground biomass (AGB) and carbon pool because of its coverage, systematic observation, and historical data archives. Recently, there have been tremendous efforts at national to global level on application of satellite and field-based data in assessing AGB and carbon pool (Chhabra et al. 2002;Zheng et al. 2004;Manhas et al. 2006;Gunlu et al. 2014;Wani et al. 2014;Salunkhee et al. 2016).

Hengeveld (1996) argued that species composition is an important attribute of a natural community that influences functioning of an ecosystem. Higher species richness in a habitat is mainly due to the presence of synuisae in the forest (Richards 1996). Tree species richness of the study can be supported by the reported tree richness (76-103 species) from subtropical broad-leaved forests of Meghalaya (Jamir 2000;Tripathi and Tripathi 2011). Variation in species richness among the studied land cover could be due to either disturbance or management. Comparison of species richness among the habitats is quite perplexing and often leads to fallible conclusions mainly on account of wide variation in the sampling area studied by the researchers. Hence, it is extremely difficult to give plausible reasons for such a variation in the species richness. Dominance is an imperative component of the community and such species may exert a controlling effect on associated species due to their competitive ability (Krebs 1994). They act as a key-species and have greater influence on structural and functional attributes (Janzen 1986;Krebs 1994). Dominance-distribution curves signify equitability and stability of the community. Log-normal distribution pattern signifies abundance of species that have transitional dominance values in the community and maturity and complexity of natural community (Magurran 1988). However, logarithmic or broken-stick distribution reflects that the community is primarily ordered with respect to one dominating factor (May 1975).

The mangroves were recorded to store significant amount of biomass. Avicennia marina performed better to display 75 % higher rate of carbon sequestration than that in Rhizophora mucronata. This could be attributed to growth efficiency and high biomass production. For instance, Avicennia marina exhibited 2.7 fold higher girth, 24 % higher net canopy photosynthesis, 2 fold aboveground biomass (AGB), 40 % more belowground biomass (BGB) and 77.3 % higher total biomass, than R. mucronata did.

The mangroves are known to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This perhaps reduces the problems that go with the 'green house gases' and global warming. They fix greater amounts of CO 2 per unit area, than what the phytoplankton do in the tropical oceans (Kathiresan and Bingham 2001). Mangroves also respond well to high CO 2 . For example, Rhizophora mangle shows greater accumulation of biomass under high CO 2 conditions (Farnsworth et al. 1996). The mangroves contribute to 10 % of total net primary production and 25 % of carbon burial in the global coastal zone (Alongi 2007). A recent assessment of global mangrove carbon budget, based on published data, indicates that global mangrove primary production is 218 trillion grams of carbon annually and this contributes carbon to the ocean through the processes of export, sediment burial and mineralization of carbon fixed by net primary production of the mangrove forests. It appears that >50 % of the carbon fixed by mangrove vegetation is unaccounted for (Bouillon et al. 2008). Because the mangroves fix and store significant amounts of carbon, their loss may have impact on global carbon budget. According to Cebrain (2002), a loss of about 35 % of the world's mangroves has resulted in a net loss of 3.8\u00d710 14 g C stored as mangrove biomass. It must be kept in mind that mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems and their carbon stock per unit area can be enormous (Twilley et al. 1992). Rehabilitating degraded mangrove areas will contribute to carbon sequestration to mitigate the global warming threat. It is expected that new counter-measure of global warming is by restoration of lost mangrove forests.

This is also a non-destructive method and easy to study temporal changes of biomass (Komiyama et al. 2008).

Estimation of the potential of a forest in sequestrating carbon involves calculating the total biomass per hectare, and then applying appropriate conversion factors to get the carbon equivalents.

In this regard, only dearth of published data is available.

Mangroves are usually coping with the stresses of high water tables, salty soil and less mechanical support due to soft muddy substrate. Mangroves are unable to mechanically support their above-ground weight without a heavy root system. Therefore, a large allocation of the net production into roots is necessary. In addition, soil moisture may cause increased allocation of biomass to the roots with enhanced cambial activity induced by ethylene production under submerged conditions (Yamamoto et al. 1995). Most mangrove species are highly sensitive to variation in nutrient availability (Boto and Wellington 1988;Feller 1995;Koch 1997;Feller et al. 2007;Lovelock et al. 2005Lovelock et al.",

Enhanced allocation to root biomass relative to shoot biomass is a common adaptation to low nutrient availability. Species of Rhizophoraceae are more tolerant to low nutrient conditions than other mangrove species (Komiyama et al. 2000;Krauss et al. 2008), as was substantiated in the present study by low ratio of AGB/BGB in R. mucronata, as compared to A. marina (Table 1). This ratio between AGB and BGB was 2.73 for A. marina and 1.95 for R. mucronata in the present study (Table 1). The ratio is much higher than other reports: 1.12 in Kandelia obovata (Khan et al. 2009), 1.05 in Ceriops tagal (Komiyama et al. 2000), 1.72 in A. marina (Mackey 1993), but is closer to 2.27 in a Rhizophora forest (Tamai et al. 1986). In tropical inland forests the ratio which ranges from 5.1 to 10.7 is higher than that in mangroves (Ogawa et al. 1965;Hozumi et al. 1969). In the present study, the growth variables exhibited significant variation largely between mangrove species rather than mangrove sites. This finds the support of Komiyama et al. (2005) who have suggested that the allometric equations of mangrove species are highly species-specific but less sitespecific. For example, the present study recorded leaf area index in a range of 3.33-6.32 (Table 1). A similar range of leaf area index is reported in other mangrove areas: 3.3 to 4.9 in R. apiculata in Mekong Delta, Vietnam (Clough et al.",

The present study registered net canopy photosynthesis in a range of 37.27 to 75.44 tC ha -1 year -1 (Table 1). A similar range of the net canopy photosynthesis has been recorded in other mangrove areas: from 24.5 tC ha -1 year -1 in 5 year old forest to 76.6 tC ha -1 year -1 in 25 year old forest in Sawi Bay (Along and Dixon 2000). The rate of carbon sequestration recorded in present study was in a range between 1.1 and 8 t C ha -1 year -1 (Table 2). This value is lower than previous report: 13.57 t C ha -1 year -1 in 20-year old stand of Rhizophora apiculata in Peninsular Malaysia (Ong et al. 1995). In the Matang of Malaysia, total standing biomass was 114 t C ha -1 for R. apiculata (Ong et al. 1995) as against 90.6 t C ha -1 in R. mucronata in the present study (Table 2). Similarly, the 20 year old stand of Rhizophora apiculata in Matang of Malaysia shows the girth at breast height (gbh) of 30 cm and the average height of 21 m with biomass ranging from 10 to 510 kg with a mean biomass of 122 kg (Ong et al. 1995). However in the present study, all these values were low for R. mucronata, showing the mean gbh value of 11.87 cm, tree height of 4.64 m with a mean biomass of 8.53 kg (Table 1).",

The organic carbon burial rate in mangrove sediment is estimated at 1.39 t C ha -1 year -1 (Duarte et al. 2005). This value is lower than the carbon sequestered in the form of mangrove standing biomass, as evident in the present study (Table 2). Relatively high primary production of tree biomass is considered to bring about unusual carbon dynamics (Komiyama 2006). Therefore, mangroves forest is a highly efficient carbon sink in the tropics. However, the global warming may hit the efficiency of carbon sequestration by mangroves, as evident by a negative correlation between carbon sequestration and soil temperature (Fig. 2m).",

The results specified that stem density had a polynomial relation with the diameter (R2 = -0.54), while tree height had a linear relationship with the diameter (R2 = 0.73). Association of tree volume, stem biomass, total tree biomass with basal area against diameter classes were positively linear [(R2 = 0.86, 0.80, 0.80) for DBH (41-60 cm)].

Association of diameter classes with (SOC) at various depths was negatively linearly correlated [R2 = -0.99; for DBH (41-60 cm)], while the topsoil layer (0-20 cm) SOC rose significantly with increase in diameter class. With the increase in tree diameter, the tree age increased definitively (R2 = 0.99).

The rapid social activities and industrialization increase the carbon contents in the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change (Sharma et al., 2011). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report 2018, the Earth's average temperature by 1.5 \u00b0C until now is considered to accelerate probably to 3 \u00b0C increase of the end of this century (Delmotte et al., 2018). According to the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCC acknowledges the forest, a potential tool to palliate and stabilize the carbon concentration (Ahmad et al., 2014b). Forest restoration is an essential tool that significantly countervails atmospheric carbon emanations (Laurance, 2007). Unfortunately, due to the forest restoration scheme's vague apprehension, the real latent of forest biomass has been halted (Holl and Zahawi, 2014). Planted forests are essential mitigation tools for the climate. Many studies have revealed that thick plantations have higher carbon stocks (Bonner et al., 2013), while some reported that the carbon stocks ratio is higher for naturally regenerated secondary forests (Chrsquo et al., 2011). However, forest carbon accumulation capacity is higher for thick planted forests than regenerated forests stand, which also rendered the application of prudish silvicultural management (Baishya et al., 2009). Forest soil can also be used as a significant sink for storing an immense volume of carbon in the form of soil organic materials that can help mitigate global climate change (Ullah et al., 2019). As a core proposition, afforestation enhances the earth's organic carbon stock by growing plant litter in the soil. Soil carbon sequestration is a long-term, cost-effective and efficient approach for enhancing soil characteristics and quality (Li et al., 2013).

Their production function has functioned the growing demands for wood products efficiently (Bauhus et al., 2010). Many ecological resources improved where plantations were developed on the deteriorated or former property (Cossalter and Pye-Smith, 2003). The capacity of forest plantations to store carbon throughout the Globe is about 3.8% (FAO, 2006), but overall, this small percentage of storage capacity plays a vital role in mitigating and fight against climate change (Canadell et al., 2007). Generally, natural forests have more potential for storing biomass than forest plantations per hectare (Pan et al., 2004). However, natural forests have decreased from 46% to 28% of the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems (Winjum and Schroeder, 1997). The measurement of biomass and carbon stock is essential to calculate the forest carbon potential in the region. The evaluation of biomass and carbon stock needs forest inventory data in sampled plots of different pools, i.e., aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic carbon, deadwood carbon and forest floor (litter/twigs) (Nizami et al., 2009;Sullivan et al., 2017). Previously, different types of study have been conducted for the estimation of carbon stock in different forest types of Pakistan (Nizami, 2012;Ahmad and Nizami, 2015;Ahmad et al., 2014a;Amir et al., 2019); most of the study in Pakistan have been conducted in the natural forests of Pakistan.

The young planted stand volume has a positive association with the diameter with the highest volume (16.69 \u00b1 4.64 m 3 ha -1 ) for the diameter class (41-60 cm); as the diameter increase, the stand volume increased significantly (Amir et  Association between tree age and diameter was observed positive linear (R 2 = 0.99); our findings are in contrast with Siddiqui et al.

With the increase in diameter, the overall tree growth variables effects significantly, i.e., in current studies, we found that out of three diameter classes, the highest diameter class (41-60 cm) has the highest values for basal area (14.19 \u00b1 3.67 m 2 ha -1 ), volume (16.69 \u00b1 4.64 m 3 ha -1 ), total tree biomass (12.76 \u00b1 1.43 t ha -1 ) and total live tree carbon stock (19.14 \u00b1 2.15 t C ha -1 ). Recent studies are also in contrast with our findings increasing carbon stock throughout the different growth periods of trees (Peichl and Arain, 2006;En et al., 2012). Trees can impact the heterogeneity and distribution of understory vegetation (Svenning and Skov, 2002). Due to its impacts on micro-environment, humus layer decomposition, soil moisture and forest management practices, forest stand configuration such as tree age and tree density has a high impact on understory vegetation. In every forest biome, the carbon content varies with different variables, such as decomposition rate, maintenance practices, tree types, and litter fertility (Kang et al., 2006). In the below-ground biomass, we found out that grasses cover decreases with the increase in diameter class/age while litter and dead wood deposits accumulation increased significantly with the increase of diameter class/age. It could be because an increase in diameter, causing the increase in tree height and canopy, ultimately enhances natural pruning and shredding of leaves, due to this forest floor covered with dead leaves and wood, stopping the growth of grasses. This finding is inconsistent with the finding of Ming et al. (2014) that an increase in diameter ultimately increasing litter productivity. The observed carbon stocking pattern for three different diameter classes was as follows: live tree > Soil > forest cover (Fig. 8).",

Our result is in association with (Amir et al., 2018)  As compared to deeper soil, the soil carbon was recorded higher in the topsoil of each diameter class stand. It may be attributed to SOC's development by decomposing the root system and litter that first reached the topsoil near the ground, as other studies have shown (Zhang et al., 2012). There was a negative correlation of soil carbon with different diameter classes at various depths, as soil carbon values tend to decline in depth. Furthermore, with the increase in diameter, the soil carbon value significantly increased; our results are in line with the findings of (Amir et al., 2019) that with the relevant stand diameter and soil depth, the mean soil carbon showed a decrease. Our study showed an increasing trend of soil carbon for different diameter classes as the highest value of SOC was obtained for the highest diameter class (41-60 cm). Besides this, litter and dead wood deposits were also recorded significantly high for the highest diameter class; Due to the deposition of organic matter in higher diameter stand, soil organic carbon typically increased with the stand age in conifer forest (Li et al., 2013). According to facts and figures, our hypothesis sustained that young afforested plantations are also vital sources to sequester the carbon. Global warming is one of the main issues for the current century, mainly caused due to greenhouse gases; for the reduction of greenhouse gases, there is a need to increase and enhance the sinks in biomass (Zhao et al., 2014). Moreover, the simplest and the best way is to plant trees; so, the afforestation could be the critical step to control global warming (Sharma et al., 2011;Misir et al., 2013). To minimize atmospheric CO2 emissions by sequestering carbon in soils, afforestation, and reforestation have been seen as necessary (Smal and Olszewska, 2008).",

So, planting trees is much better than planting nothing; increasing forest area is an effective way to reduce elevated atmospheric carbon (Taylor et al., 2007); as the tree increases its diameter, absorption capacity increases (Huy and Tuan, 2008). The mountain ranges of the Karakorum-Hindukush region in northwest Pakistan has great potential to sequester and sink atmospheric carbon dioxide.",

Restoration of ecosystems ultimately depends on this understanding. Numerous attempts have been made to investigate relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions experimentally and by using comparative approaches; to date, the most compelling evidence for strong linkages has come from experiments in grassland ecosystems in which species diversity was manipulated directly in replicated treatments (Hector et al. 1999, Fornara & Tilman 2009, Isbell & Wilsey 2011, Reich et al. 2012). Earlier work was criticized for failing to account for the influence of the 'selection effect', that is, the higher probability of including 1 or a few highly productive species in the most species-rich treatments (Loreau & Hector 2001, Fargione et al. 2007). In addition, studies that use only a small fraction of the relevant species pool at a given site may not produce results that are applicable under natural conditions. Although grasslands still predominate in the literature, there are increasing numbers of studies from other ecosystems including a few from marine habitats (Emmerson & Huxham 2002, Bruno et al. 2005, Cardinale et al. 2007). However, the ecological significance of diversity remains unknown in many systems. For example, it is uncertain what relevance studies on short-lived non-woody plants have to woody ecosystems such as forests. Long-term manipulative experiments using trees have recently been initiated at a number of sites across Europe, and early findings suggest a positive influence of species diversity on a range of ecosystem functions (Oelmann et al. 2010, Zeugin et al. 2010, Hector et al. 2011) but are unlikely to yield conclusive results rapidly.",

Mangroves are trees found in estuaries and intertidal zones in tropical and subtropical regions (Tomlinson 1986). Whilst the mangrove ecosystem supports a relatively low diversity of plant forms, it is rich in other organisms, including arthropods, molluscs, fishes and birds (Field et al. 1998). A relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions has been inferred (MacNae 1968, Field et al. 1998), but rarely tested directly in mangrove ecosystems. Previous studies that have used comparative approaches (Bosire et al. 2003, Kirui et al. 2006, Mukhopadhyay et al. 2006, Kairo et al. 2008) have focused on the influence of management systems and environmental contexts on ecological functions; they have generally emphasized the roles of nutrient fluxes and macrofauna in determining the net primary productivity of the single dominant mangrove species, such as Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk. 1797-8. Whilst comparative methods can provide useful information on the main drivers of ecosystem function, they usually cannot explain the underlying mechanisms behind relationships (Huston 1997), and can obscure within-habitat variations (Schmid 2002). Mangrove forests are naturally comprised of a small number of mangrove species, which means that the manipulation of most of the species present is feasible, and they can grow relatively fast (Kairo 1995, Bosire et al. 2008, Kairo et al. 2008); hence experimental approaches to biodiversity and ecosystem linkages are possible. To our knowledge, however, no previous experiment has been conducted in a mangrove ecosystem where species diversity was manipulated. In July 2004, a long-term experiment, measuring a range of ecosystem functions, was initiated in Kenya.

Here we present findings on the effects of species diversity and soil conditions on one of these ecosystem functions, i.e. aboveground biomass production. The null hypotheses were: (1) Species diversity and identity of mangroves has no effect on the aboveground productivity of planted plots. (2) Aboveground productivity is not influenced by variations in environmental factors over the range typical of the local soft shore intertidal environment.

Few studies have determined the effect of reforestation on N compared with C accumulation or the impact of forest community structure on soil organic C (SOC) and N stocks. We selected a chronosequence of six forested study sites to investigate whether SOC and N were affected by land-use history or forest community structure. We took soil cores at depths of 15 to 35 cm from eight plots at each study site, measured SOC and N concentrations, SOC/N ratios, the minimum time since partial and full reforestation, and tree composition and structure. The SOC and N concentrations increased with time since partial and full reforestation in shallow soils (top 10 cm; p < 0.01) but less so in deeper soils (10-20 cm; p > 0.05; rocky soil limited analyses below 20 cm). The SOC and N concentrations were more closely linked to the onset of reforestation.

There was no relationship between either SOC or N and forest composition or structure (p > 0.05). Our results demonstrate that the onset of reforestation is a key factor controlling SOC and N concentrations, which increased from partial to full reforestation, particularly in shallow soils. The more pronounced increase in the SOC/N ratio in deeper soils reflected an accumulation of SOC with time in these soils, while N content remained comparatively stable.",

We also found that correlations in shallow soil of both SOC and N were stronger with time since partial reforestation than with time since full reforestation. Hence, time elapsed since the beginning of reforestation was a better predictor of SOC and N concentrations than the amount of time that had passed before a full forest developed. The effect of reforestation on SOC is consistent with previous studies conducted in a wide range of environments, but fewer studies have investigated the effects of reforestation on N accumulation. Accumulation of C in soil is generally observed when cultivated land is converted to permanent perennial vegetation or when agricultural lands are converted to urban soils, at least in part because agricultural areas tend to be depleted in C and N (Compton and Boone, 2000;Post and Kwon, 2000;Knops and Tilman, 2000;Pouyat et al., 2006). For example, Guo and Gifford (2002) found that C stocks in cropland abandoned to the growth of secondary forest increased by 53% across decadal timescales. However, the gain or loss of soil C also depends on the intensity of past land-use practices (Silver et al., 2000). For example, soil C pools in pastures with moderate grazing remained lower than in pastures 8 yr after abandonment (Buschbacher et al., 1988). Silver et al. (2000) found that while tropical forests growing on abandoned agricultural land rapidly accumulated biomass, soil C accumulated fastest on sites that were cleared but not yet developed, such as land used as pasture. Our results also suggest that SOC and N accumulation continued for several decades following reforestation; increases in both SOC and N concentrations were observed across the entire 80-yr chronosequence. Similar patterns have been observed in other studies. For example, Silver et al.",
        "ce757d2a-7cfe-40fb-b71b-dabe29d83c25": "Similar patterns have been observed in other studies. For example, Silver et al. (2000) documented a continuous accumulation of SOC for 100 yr following reforestation in tropical regions, although this accumulation slowed with time. Likewise, increases in SOC and N contents of urban soils have been observed across multiple decades, with the rate of accumulation slowing with time (Qian and Follett, 2002;Golubiewski, 2006;Pouyat et al., 2009). Considering the actual concentrations of SOC and N, our values, which ranged from about 0.5 to 5.5 kg m -2 for SOC and 0.07 to 0.55 kg m -2 for N, fall within the range of values reported in many other studies (Leisman, 1957;Zak et al., 1990;Compton and Boone, 2000;Silver et al., 2000;Pouyat et al., 2009). While it is difficult to directly compare results among studies because of site-specific environmental variations, differences in sampling and measurement methodology, and variations in reported measurement units (e.g., SOC is varyingly reported as kilograms per square meter or organic C percentage), the values for SOC and N stocks from our sites fall near the mid to upper range of values for similar study areas, suggesting that our sites may be approaching their capacities as SOC and N sinks. Other studies have reported results similar to ours overall but differing in some respects. For example, Hamburg (1984) observed an increase in soil organic matter and N content in an old-field chronosequence spanning 75 yr in New Hampshire and predicted that a minimum of 200 yr would be necessary to attain the levels of soil organic matter found in nearby primary forests. On the other hand, Zak et al. (1990) found that SOC and N declined immediately following agricultural abandonment in eastcentral Minnesota because the decomposition rate exceeded the rate of production. They also observed that SOC and N began to increase after about 5 yr and continued to increase for the next 60 yr.",

However, Houghton et al. (1983) estimated that SOC in temperate regions recovers to 90% of predisturbance levels within 50 yr, with little increase thereafter. This estimate was supported by a study of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) planted on old fields and on recently cleared land in the southeastern United States (Schiffman and Johnson, 1989) but not in the semiarid grasslands of Colorado (Burke et al., 1995). While we were able to diagnose a general pattern of SOC and N accumulation, our data do not have the duration or precision to document the decline in accumulation rate observed in some of the aforementioned studies. The pattern of SOC accumulation with depth in our study differed from those observed in other investigations. Conventional crop use commonly results in soil homogenization and a weak concentration gradient of SOC in surface soils (Post and Kwon, 2000). Following reforestation, SOC typically accumulates at the surface because of non-mixing of litter, while SOC in deeper soil layers decreases because of the decomposition of crop residues (Paul et al., 2002). In our study area, SOC increased in both shallow and deeper soils following reforestation (albeit more slowly in deeper soils), and the concentration gradient of SOC from shallow to deeper soils was similarly strong for all samples, regardless of land-use history. This result also explains the more pronounced increase of the C/N ratio in deeper soils that reflected the accumulation of SOC while the N content remained comparatively stable. In contrast, Bashkin and Binkley (1998) found a net loss in SOC 11 yr after the afforestation of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) fields in Hawaii by Eucalyptus saligna Sm.; a gain in C in surface soils (0-10 cm deep) was more than counterbalanced by a corresponding loss of C in subsoils (10-40 cm deep).",
        "12930aa4-d69c-4d0d-a0a7-c6ed2e4cf291": "However, because our sites were less recently reforested, our longer term patterns of SOC accumulation might not be comparable with these shortterm observations. Another study based on a reforested site in Ethiopia found that SOC and N increased with time in the uppermost 20 cm of soil, but increases below 20 cm were negligible (Lemenih et al., 2005). While we could not examine soils deeper than 20 cm in the present study, we did observe that the magnitude of SOC accumulation decreased with depth, consistent with the Ethiopian study. Variations in the results from these different studies suggest the influence of site-or species-specific characteristics on both SOC and N. For example, Hooker and Compton (2003) suggested that site-specific factors (e.g., soil texture, management history, or species composition) may influence SOC storage in deeper soil, producing inconsistent trends. Furthermore, this variability indicates that the scale of analysis, the length of the period of study, and/or the soil depths measured may have a significant impact on the patterns observed. For example, Leisman (1957) analyzed SOC and total N in soil following the revegeta-tion of mining spoil banks in Minnesota at depths and across a time interval similar to our study and found that concentrations of SOC and N were similar to those from our study area. No significant relationships were detected between SOC and N and measures of tree species composition and structure in our study area, even though these attributes have been shown to vary substantially across the study area (Kolbe et al., 2016). A primary reason that SOC and N were independent from tree species composition and structure is that sugar maple was the most abundant tree species at all of our study sites except Tranquility; at that site, eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) was the most abundant species and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and sugar maple were the second most abundant tree species (Table 1; Supplemental Table S1). Hence, sugar maple contributes a vast amount of leaf litter to these forests, including Tranquility because eastern red cedar is not deciduous.",
        "2748cd9d-df6e-42f0-a452-3f9bec55cc44": "Such a disproportionate effect of litter from sugar maple may have homogenized the concentrations of SOC and N among our study sites and led to our finding that SOC, N, and the SOC/N ratio were independent of tree species composition and structure. In other studies, the rate and magnitude of SOC and N accumulation and distribution within the soil differed among tree species (Lemenih et al., 2005;Jandl et al., 2007) and with total species diversity ( Jandl et al., 2007). Compton and Boone (2000) found that plant community composition had a significant impact on the rate of N recovery. In other cases, however, community composition and structure had little impact on soil organic matter. For example, Zak et al. (1990) observed that soil C/N ratios differed little in a chronosequence of old-field succession, despite extensive changes in species composition. Lugo and Brown (1992) also determined that soil C accumulation can be highly dependent on species characteristics such as litter production, litter quality, microclimate changes, and influence on edaphic conditions. This is consistent with our study in which litter accumulation by a single tree species probably contributed to the lack of an effect of tree community structure on SOC and N accumulation. Recently, field experiments have revealed that atmospheric deposition of N can alter biogeochemical cycles, thereby increasing leaching of dissolved organic C and N (Lovett et al., 2000;Pregitzer et al., 2004;Wallenstein et al., 2006). Coal-fired power plants in the Ohio River Valley to the east of Cincinnati release >90 Gg of nitrogen oxides and >68 Gg of SO 2 annually (National Atmospheric Deposition Program, 2012). This output results in a total annual wet deposition of 3.5 to 3.7 kg ha -1 yr -1 of total N on our study plots (see supplement to Cameron et al., 2015).",
        "16109375-dd35-4359-9911-bd08df8ac53c": "Such increases in soil N can alter the rates of microbiological processes such as N mineralization and nitrification, increase the release of SOC from the soil, adversely affect photosynthesis, and increase the rate of stand decline (Aber et al., 1998;Duchesne et al., 2002;Wallenstein et al., 2006). Relative to our study, increases in soil N with a concomitant loss of Ca adversely affect sugar maple trees and seedlings, leading to an overall decline in their abundance (Aber et al., 1998;Horsley et al., 2000;Sullivan et al., 2013;Momen et al., 2015). In addition, Knorr et al. (2005) determined that litter decomposition was stimulated by ambient N deposition <5 kg ha -1 yr -1 , which encompasses the range of deposition recorded at our field sites. Increased mass loss for highly decomposable litter such as that from sugar maple can result in a loss of up to 20% of soil SOC with high deposition of N (Waldrop et al., 2004). While is it is clear that N deposition affects SOC and N concentrations of soil in forests dominated by sugar maple, this process began in the early 1950s when new coal-fired power plants were built in the Ohio Valley, and any addition of SOC or N to soils resulting from N deposition would be included in our results. However, because of closure of some of these plants in 2015 and perhaps further closures resulting in lower atmospheric N deposition, future studies may find lower concentrations of soil SOC and N in sugar maple forests as well as increased forest health. These studies may be able to ascertain whether a decrease in N deposition alters the role of reforestation in determining concentrations of SOC and N.",

For instance, in 2000, forest plantations occupied 116 million hectares in Asia, 32 in Europe, 28 in America, and 8 in Africa (Nsabimana et al., 2008). In addition to timber and non-timber (e.g. fruit and latex) production, tree plantations can provide other important ecosystem services, such as regulation of water flow, improvement in soil fertility, and carbon sequestration (Humpenoder et al., 2014). In this respect, differences between N-fixing and non-Nfixing species, between gymnosperms and angiosperms, and between native and exotic species are often highlighted (Hoogmoed et al., 2014). The litter on forest floor acts as a sink and source of nutrients, and the rate at which forest litter falls and decays, regulates the energy flow, primary production, and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems (Scheibe et al., 2015). The quality of the litter layer determines its decomposition rates (Zhang et al., 2015), the amount of nutrient absorption by the plant's root system, the degree of interception of atmospheric depositions, and the interaction between the arboreal layer and the rainfall (Levia and Herwitz, 2005). The consequent impacts of these processes on soil properties differ depending on quality of litter produced by different tree species (Hagen-Thorn et al., 2004). The physical properties of forest soils develop under natural conditions by the influence of permanent vegetation over a long period of time. These properties may be almost permanent characteristics unless modified by harvesting operations, forest fires and changes in tree species composition (Osman, 2013). Additionally, there is evidence that plantation leads to significant changes in the chemical properties and biochemical cycles of soils (Hoogmoed et al., 2014). According to Binkley and Valentine (1991), the influence of various tree species on soil pH is significantly relevant to the first 10 cm beneath the layer of litter.",
        "fbf171d0-2afc-4c74-9f83-4331f5216a16": "Studies have shown that soil pH and the amount of exchangeable cations can be positively influenced by the type of tree species (Mohr et al., 2005). Oulehle et al. (2007) observed a stronger acidification of the soil in coniferous than in broad-leaved tree stands due to their differences in litter quality. A higher C/N ratio, lower pH and lower nutrient content in the soil as well as an increase in toxic Al 3+ content in soil water were also observed in coniferous rather than in hardwood forests (Barbier et al., 2008). Earthworm biomass is an appropriate biological indicator of litter quality, soil fertility and habitat productivity (Nachtergale et al., 2002). According to Tian et al. (2000), tree plantations may influence earthworm abundance by altering the physicochemical properties of soils, such as the temperature, moisture regime, pH, soil organic content (SOC) and litter inputs. Similarly, soil microbial respiration (SMR) has also been described to be influenced by tree species and site fertility (Butnor et al., 2003). Fine roots exert an important impact on carbon allocation and nutrient cycling of below-ground ecosystems (Sah et al., 2011). Thus, fine root production and turnover have a direct impact on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems (Jha and Mohapatra, 2010). Vogt et al. (1996) have suggested differences in fine root biomass between evergreen and deciduous forests, but these differences may not be so clear. Also, higher fine root biomass were recorded in needle leaf and broad leaf forests according to the cited works by Jackson et al. (1997) and Noguchi et al. (2007), respectively. Afforestation has been reported to either cause significant alteration in soil N mineralization (Li et al., 2014) or to have a negligible effect on soil N mineralization (Zeng et al., 2009).",
        "5704dd2f-5d4c-4273-88d1-5f3a79949082": "Soil N transformation (i.e., mineralization, ammonification and nitrification) is a microbial process regulated by SOM contents and changes in SOM inputs resulting from afforestation; therefore, these potentially lead to differences in soil N mineralization (Templer et al., 2005). Abiotic factors (e.g., soil temperature, moisture and pH) exert important influences on soil N dynamics following reforestation (Li et al., 2007;Shan et al., 2011;Yao et al., 2011). The use of N-fixing tree species in forest restoration greatly affects the rates of N mineralization and other N transformations (Knops et al., 2002). The quality and quantity of forest litter would indirectly control the transformations of soil N (Li et al., 2014). The differential influence of broad-leaved and coniferous tree species on N mineralization rate has been revealed by Xiong et al. (2014). Soil N mineralization also affects the production of trace gases in natural ecosystems (Davidson et al., 1993), and alters N cycling routes. For example, by enhancing net soil N nitrification, soil N mineralization can result in increased nitrate losses (Wright and Rasmussen, 1998). The temporal pattern of soil N mineralization should be documented to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of N in the function of a particular ecosystem. Based on a closer examination of changes in soil properties over time, following the establishment of different tree species is necessary to understand the mechanisms responsible for changes in SOC and nutrient availability, which, in turn, will assist in the development of effective, long-term strategies to maintain soil quality and fertility. Our case study aimed to investigate the effects of broadleaved and coniferous tree species on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the topsoil in the natural forest and tree plantation systems, under the temperate climate of northern Iran.",

Numerous restoration initiatives have been taken to restore its ecosystem services. Deforested areas have been restored through active intervention or natural regeneration. Understanding the impact of those different reforestation approaches on soil quality should provide important scientific and practical conclusions on increasing forest cover in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. However, studies evaluating active planting versus natural regeneration in terms of soil recovery are scarce. We evaluate soil dynamics under those two contrasting strategies at an early stage (<10 years). Reforestation was conducted simultaneously on degraded lands previously used for cattle grazing and compared to an abandoned pasture as a reference system. We examined soil physicochemical properties such as: pH, soil organic matter content, soil moisture, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Cu, Al, and soil texture. We also present the costs of both methods. We found significant differences in restored areas regarding pH, Na, Fe, Mn content, and the cost. Soil moisture was significantly higher in pasture.

Legislative negligence in the enforcement of existing legislation has contributed to forest loss, spurring conversion of forested land for agricultural, economic, transport, or urban purposes [3]. Restoration is now an international priority to recuperate degraded ecosystems and their services [2,4]. One of the crucial areas for restoration in Brazil is the Atlantic Forest. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most valuable biomes in Brazil. The biome has been recognized as a tropical biodiversity hotspot that includes unique endemic species and provides local and global ecosystem services such as climate regulation, water, and nutrient cycling [5,6]. Originally, covering about 150 million ha [7], it went through a period of deforestation [8] as the result of land-use change for urban development and agricultural production, most recently, for cattle ranching [9]. Approximately 12% of the original vegetation cover remains [10] (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1), and over than 90% of the remaining area is in private lands [11,12]. Deforestation is responsible for loss of soil nutrients, soil erosion, and biodiversity loss [13,14]. The beneficial effect of forest regrowth on biodiversity and soil organic carbon dynamics has been well documented [15][16][17][18]. For example, the meta-analysis conducted by Crouzeilles et al. [17] found that the success of restoring biodiversity and vegetation structure was, respectively, 34-56% and 19-56% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems. In turn, De Medeiros et al. [18] reported a 20% gain in soil organic carbon due to natural regeneration in areas previously used for intensive farming systems in Brazil. However, changes in soil properties and quality due to afforestation are still poorly studied and often overlooked in restoration projects [18][19][20]. A systematic review by Mendes et al. [19] showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration in Brazilian Atlantic Forest did not include any soil quality indicator.",
        "423366b8-a325-43b9-b350-17ee861ae07b": "This result points to a soil data gap in restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. Closing this gap is critical to validating the most effective restoration strategy. Considering and demonstrating recovery of soil quality in the short term are important with regard to communication with landowners about more sustainable land management and forest restoration on their lands [20]. Soil is an integral part of the forest ecosystem and plays a key role in successful forest regeneration [21,22]. As soil properties may affect seedlings' establishment, growth, and survival [23]. Intrinsic interactions between soil and vegetation maintain an optimal nutrient cycle and forest dynamics [24]. Furthermore, diverse tree species may have different impacts on soil fertility, and consequently contribute differently to forest growth [25][26][27]. At a regional scale, land-use change may contribute rapidly to diminish soil quality [28]. Numerous studies have shown a negative effect of deforestation on soil organic matter, nitrogen, and soil microbiota activity, which converts soil to a low fertility state and results in lower productivity [29,30]. Enhancing and maintaining soil quality are necessary to guarantee environmental sustainability and forest recovery [31][32][33]. Active restoration and natural regeneration are two important strategies for restoring large areas of degraded and deforested tropical lands. Active restoration consists of management techniques such as planting seeds or seedlings. This technique requires often soil amendment and correction [34]. Natural regeneration occurs when the factors that cause environmental stress (e.g., cattle grazing) are removed and secondary succession can proceed, and generally no active management of the soil or vegetation is undertaken. Deciding which strategy should be applied depends on many factors, such a level of land degradation, natural rate of ecosystem recovery, financial resources, and the final objective of the restoration project [34,35]. In this study, we evaluate and compare soil properties under two restoration strategies: active and natural regeneration in the early stage (<10 years) of recovery, in tropical conditions. We address three questions: (i) what changes occur in soils in early stages of forest restoration? (ii) how does the restoration strategy affect soil properties and soil ecosystem services?",

Our research aims to increase the knowledge of tropical soils and their response to forest regrowth, to establish the most successful strategy on abandoned lands previously used for cattle grazing. The results obtained here may be useful to monitor occurrences belowground, monitor the effectiveness of the restoration approach in terms of soil ecosystem services recovery, and provide insights for further research.",
        "66d3ff88-a6aa-4d7c-80e8-73bf05851822": "Poor pastureland management due to overgrazing and insufficient nutrient reposition can lead to the nutrient-rich topsoil depletion, reduction in soil fertility and biomass yields, followed by a loss of profit and income for the farmer. Consequently, unproductive pastures are abandoned and then exposed to erosion and leaching processes, which aggravates soil degradation [53][54][55]. Up to 18 million hectares of low-productivity pasture can be reforested in the Atlantic Forest, which is equivalent to the actual coverage of the remaining Atlantic Forest biome, without hindering the development of Brazilian agriculture [56]. Monitoring and understanding the belowground processes that occur during forest restoration is pivotal for sustainable land management and helpful to restoration planning and decision-making process. Here, analyzing short-term response (after six years) we found no significant differences in soil properties between restoration strategies, except for Na in P2 area and pH in P3 area (active plantation), compared to CON (abandoned pasture). Our results suggest that the recovery of soil properties on land formerly used for cattle grazing is a long-term process regardless of the restoration method. These findings corroborate previous studies conducted not only in the tropics but in other regions of the world, e.g., [57,58]. The highest content of Na in pasture soil may be associated with a difficult drainage caused by soil compaction, common in degraded pastures. Soils that show difficult drainage of the water favor the accumulation of Na in the superficial horizons [59]. Iron and manganese usually occur in low levels, and their amount depends on the material of origin and degree of soil weathering [60]. The ways in which these micronutrients are available to plants are related to soil properties such as organic matter, pH, and moisture [61][62][63][64]. In our study, soil from the hillside had significantly lower Fe and significantly higher Mn content in the comparison with the pasture located on the flat area. This may be explained by different soil types occurring in the study region.",
        "1344644d-82cb-41b1-aff8-76959834bc1d": "This may be explained by different soil types occurring in the study region. Soils from flat areas (P3, REG and CON) are classified as fulvic Neosols, typical for lowland [41], while Ultisols are predominant soils on the slope. Fulvic Neosols are soils derived from recent quaternary sediments, nonhydromorphic and with low pedogenetic development. Ultisols are highly weathered soils with accumulation of clay in the B horizon, typical of humid tropical environment [65,66]. Concentrations of Fe and Mn under active restoration in the slope might result from the composition of the parent material that gave rise to the Ultisols. Thus, we presume that independently of restoration strategy and landform, soil Fe and Mn content are related to soil type. In turn, soil pH from active/flat P3 area was significantly lower than active/slope P1 and P2. We did not observe difference between soil pH from natural regeneration and CON, in flat areas, in relation to P1 and P2. We suggest that this may result from tree species that were planted. Hong et al. [67] showed correlation between plants introduced for the forest regrowth and soil pH: when the tree species for forest establishing are selected based on initial soil pH value, afforestation may modify soil pH by increasing pH in acid soils or decreasing pH in alkaline soils. In general, forest soils are acidic with limited fertility [68,69]. This finding indicated another benefit of forest restoration: neutralizing of soil pH can potentially improve soil health and promote ecosystem productivity [67]. Soil moisture content was significantly lower in all restored areas when compared to the pasture area. There were no differences among treatments, indicating that the restoration strategy did not influence this process. Soil under forest is generally less humid than under other vegetation types such as shrubland or grassland since trees reduce soil water content by evapotranspiration, infiltration, and canopy interception [70].",
        "067de46e-8968-4907-9acc-502a603e0463": "Evapotranspiration, the combined processes of direct evaporation and transpiration by plants, is influenced by changes in rooting characteristics, leaf area, stomatal response, and plant surface albedo [71]. Thus, evapotranspiration from forest is much higher than, for example, from pasture. In addition, infiltration capacity is much more expressive under forest areas due to the macroporosity, provided by death roots and animal canals [72]. Additionally, trees intercept rainfall water due to the leaf area size and roughness [72,73]. We found no significant difference between restoration strategies and CON, in terms of N and P concentrations. Regarding nitrogen, our results contrast with studies in secondary tropical forests in which N has a direct relationship with aboveground biomass [74][75][76] but are consistent with Holl and Zahawi [77] who report a similar result. Thus, even considering the well-known relationship between soil nutrient parameters and tree abundance, perhaps another factor here might be more relevant: the relation between nitrogen dynamics and the age of restoration. Nitrogen accumulation in the soil results from microbial decomposition of litter and roots originating from vegetation recovery [78,79]. Previous studies demonstrated that at the later restoration stage, forests have more fine roots than at earlier restoration stages [75,77]. Fine roots are easy to turnover [79]. As the number fine roots increase over vegetation succession, turnover of dead roots also increases and that may result in higher N concentration inputs into the soil [78,80]. The lack of a significant relationship between N and restored areas may have occurred since higher percentages of N content in soil are found in older restoration ages [76], and our study was conducted on areas restored for seven years. For example, Teixeira [81] reported the recovery of nutrient cycling to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Thus, longer restoration periods would be necessary for the results regarding soil N restoration to become more evident. In contrast to nitrogen, soil phosphorus is derived primarily from rock weathering and tropical soils are usually strongly weathered and have low total P content [82].",
        "96656b86-1e83-4759-9a28-b745e038d774": "Moreover, low concentrations of P in soil during forest restoration might be caused by increased demands by plants due to biomass accumulation [83,84]. Different strategies of restoration in our study did not show significant difference of P in relation to CON. Here, the lowest average of P content was observed in CON and the highest average was observed in P1 area. We assume that here soil pH can be a key factor. Soil pH has been recognized an important factor influencing soil phosphorus availability [85]. The analyzed soils are acidic. In this case, inorganic P could react with Al and Fe ions, making it immobilized and non-available to plants [86]. Considering the dynamic of soil organic matter (SOM), we initially assumed that relatively short period of pasture-to-forest conversion might not be sufficient to restore initial carbon stock, which has been shown in previous studies [57,87]. However, the outcomes from other research that considers the accumulation rate of carbon in the soil are inconsistent. For example, Guo and Gifford [88] demonstrated that changing pasture lands to secondary forests results in soil carbon decrease. It is because in contrast with tree systems, pastures contain a higher number of fine roots that incorporate more carbon from their fast decomposition rate. Our results may also be explained by the presence of residual organic matter from the dominant grass in pasture. From the other hand, Carrasco-Carballido [58] and Nogueira [89] observed the increase of soil organic carbon content during both natural regeneration and planting after two and ten years, respectively. The authors suggested that the initial soil nutrient content and the use of leguminous tree species are crucial for fast soil organic matter recovery. Finally, looking into socio-economic aspects, if we assume that the focus of restoration is the recovery of soil properties such as carbon stock and macronutrients content, natural regeneration, which is generally cheaper [90], would be better option. The active restoration costs for the current project were approximately three times higher than for natural regeneration. Additionally, the active strategy required soil correction and was more labor-intensive.",
        "6b69c755-2d41-4b93-8f3a-9df145fd7ad6": "Additionally, the active strategy required soil correction and was more labor-intensive. Nevertheless, each restoration strategy has its implications and should be evaluated ad hoc [34,57,91,92]. Restoration projects should also consider neg-ative aspects on improper land management, such as displace pre-existing agricultural activities (leakage), labor scarcity, or low tree survival [93][94][95]. Summing up, from the socio-economic point given early soil properties response, low-cost natural regeneration might be a preferred method to be proceeded on abandoned pastures in the study region. Our study has limitations that should be mentioned. First, in case of field trials, environmental conditions are beyond the control of researchers. Second, access to some sampling sites and the soil sampling itself was restricted, which might have influenced the design of the experiment. Third, the results presented here are based on short-term studies. The authors are aware that such field studies are time consuming and require long-term monitoring to fully investigate soil changes during forest restoration. It should also be emphasized that preliminary soil data that we could use as reference was not available before the implementation of the forestry project. Since the restored areas were previously used for grazing cattle, we assumed that an abandoned pasture, used here as a control, would be the best reference system in terms of soil conditions. This weakens the experimental design in this work, because the lack of access to the original state of the restored areas from which soil samples were taken limits our ability to make conclusive statistical inferences with them. Our analyses aim strictly to guide future work in the field, providing hypotheses of early results to be tested under conditions that will allow for stronger experimental designs. At the end, we agree that our sample units cannot represent true replicates [96,97] given the distance between trial plots and restoration treatments. However, since all treatments were implemented in the same landscape, under similar environmental conditions such as forest cover and climate, we still believe that this experimental design could provide valuable information on tropical ecological restoration.",

The objective of this study was to verify the influence of rosewood stands on physical and chemical soil attributes. This study was conducted at a rural farm in the Mau\u00e9s municipality, 350 km from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Samples were collected in five areas; 4-, 10-and 20-year-old rosewood stands, and 15-and 60-year-old secondary forests. The latter two served as control treatments, reflecting natural spontaneous succession conditions over time.

The soil bulk density ranged from 0.81 to 0.99 g cm -3 among all areas and no significant difference was found (P = 0.052). With exception to 4-year-old stand, the organic matter (2.68-5.87%) and carbon stock (18.57-31.71 Mg ha -1 ) did not differ significantly between stands and control treatments.",

The soil beneath the 4-year-old rosewood stand, however, differed from the other four areas, having significantly higher natural clay content (> 600 g kg -1 ) and higher topsoil chemical concentrations, associated with the more recent burning. This result represents the first step in addressing concern about sustainable soil use in rosewood forestry economics. Consequently, this kind of rosewood plantation can be recommended as an appropriate use of historically exploited areas, providing economic return from local biodiversity.",

The exploitation of this species initially followed a classic extractivist model, with individuals of all ages and sizes cut indiscriminately and with no attempt to regenerate populations (Sampaio et al., 2007). As a result, rosewood is now considered as an endangered species in the wild (IUCN, 2015). In Brazil, existing legislation permits the commercialization of rosewood essential oils only when they have been obtained from commercial plantations (MMA, 2014;Krainovic et al., 2017a). Rosewood plantations have helped reduce the pressure on natural populations while maintaining genetic variability in the species and promoting income generation and employment (Krainovic et al., 2018). Thus, decision makers need guiding principles for the investment of limited resources into the cultivation of this species, and technical criteria must be developed. In addition, plantation forestry is among the options proposed by IPCC for mitigating deforestation and carbon emissions in the Amazon (IPCC, 2007;Fearnside et al., 2009;Fearnside, 2012). However, monoculture tree plantations can have negative effects on soil quality (Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2014). Soil quality is usually considered to have three main aspects: physical, chemical, and biological properties. All three aspects are important in assessing the extent of land degradation-e.g., the effects of land-use change and consequent ecosystem perturbation (Holub\u00edk et al., 2014) on C (carbon) and N (nitrogen) stocks and fluxes-or of amelioration, and for identifying management practices for sustainable land use (Dexter, 2004).",

In the case of rosewood, the cultivated stands occupy the space that was once Amazonian forest, and their extraction by the removal of above ground biomass (whole tree, or the crown by pruning) can lead to a considerable removal of nutrients, which may decrease soil fertility and limit future productivity (Krainovic et al., 2017b;McMahon et al., 2019). Regarding physical aspects, textural porosity is barely affected by soil management; structural porosity, however, is sensitive to management factors such as tillage and cropping (Dexter, 2004;Spinelli et al., 2017). Such management systems, when mismanaged, may lead to poor workability, low water infiltration rates, modification of the water retention curve, and increased mechanical resistance of the soil to root growth, which may inhibit the absorption of nutrients. Consequently, impoverishment of soil bio-physical and chemical properties, a known effect of inappropriate land-use, may lead to environmental degradation (St. Clair and Lynch, 2010) at different scales and intensities (Cram et al., 2015) over time. One way to obtain the knowledge of such soil changes over time is to study chronosequences (Chen et al., 2014). The essential elements of such studies are as follows: two or more stages of evaluation, multiple stand characteristics that vary across stages, at least one independent verification of time series, and standardized measurements (Walker et al., 2010). With these aspects in mind, this study aimed to compare soil nutrient relationships between land management systems, with a chronosequence of rosewood cultivation in the central Amazonian region, and the physical and chemical aspects of the soils on which rosewood stands grow.",

Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) plantations were selected from among the youngest to oldest (2-16 yr) within a 100 km 2 area in southeastern New Brunswick. Natural forests were also included as benchmark sites. The forest floor and tree foliage was sampled and trees measured on 0.05-ha plots. The forest floor samples were used to determine organic mass, nutrient contents and pH. In pine plantations, organic matter accumulated rapidly during the period of exponential tree growth, but leveled off at about 45 Mg ha -1 . This was within the range of benchmark sites with mixed conifer-hardwood cover. In spruce plantations, the forest floor mass ranged upward to 77 Mg ha -1 . Development was strongly influenced by the nature of the previous forest. Spruce forest floors were on average more acid and had lower nutrient concentrations, particularly N and Ca. The observed differences suggest that nutrients are recycled more rapidly in the pine plantations, partly explaining the superior growth of the latter.",

The study was conducted during 2013-2015. Among the study sites, the maximum tree density (575 \u00b1 90.14 ind. ha -1 ) was reported in New Tehri (altitude: > 1801 masl) and minimum (135 \u00b1 5.00 ind. ha -1 ) in Daddi (altitude: 1001-1400 masl). The highest (96 \u00b1 18.36 t ha -1 ) above-ground carbon stock was estimated in Kandikhal where bole, branch, and foliage contribute 89.93 \u00b1 19.47, 5.17 \u00b1 1.04 and 0.90 \u00b1 0.14 t ha -1 , respectively, while lowest (26.68 \u00b1 9.48 t ha -1 ) was in Gumkhal, and contribution from the same component was found as 20.72 \u00b1 7.84, 4.50 \u00b1 1.58, and 1.47 \u00b1 0.11 t ha -1 , respectively.

This Himalayan zone covers nearly 19% area and contributes 33% of soil organic carbon (SOC) reserves of the country (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). However, the Himalayan forest eco-region is most vulnerable to climate change (Ravindranath et al. 2006 andChaturvedi et al. 2010). Even over short periods, degradation increases the susceptibility of these areas to climate alteration. As forest degradation plays a significant role in climate change in the Himalayan region, it is essential to obtain information about this change at the outset (Pant and Tiwari 2014). This study focuses on Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii Sarg.) forest. Chir pine dominates in lower Himalaya (Ghildiyal et al. 2009) and provides various ecosystem services to the people of the Himalayan catchment (Gupta et al. 2009). Chir pine covers 869,000 ha and spreads in Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, West Bengal, and Arunachal Pradesh states ranging from 450 to 2300 m above sea level (masl; Gupta et al. 2009). Chir pine is a principal species of Himalayan subtropical forests and reported to be 3rd (3.97%) highest contributors in growing stock after sal (Shorea robusta, 11.36%) and teak (Tectona grandis, 5.57%) forests and further holding ranks 7th (3.04%) for trees outside forest growing stocks (FSI, 2017). Although both Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis range up to 1220 masl-1300 masl, respectively, Pinus roxburghii has been reported to be growing up to 2300 masl (Luna, 2005).",
        "bc7fbbad-ee7e-470f-b0e2-a741bdbf6bee": "Chir pine forests have huge potential for storing carbon in both biomass and forest soils (Jianmin and Zhing 2007;Kumar and Kumar 2020). Uttarakhand forests can accumulate carbon ranges from 1.5 to 3.0 t C ha -1 yr -1 in poor-quality forests and to 5.0-9.0 t C ha -1 yr -1 in the good forests (Singh et al. 1985). However, because of forest degradation, the regional averages are falling between 2.5 and 3.5 t C ha -1 yr -1 (Rajeev et al. 2011). Uttarakhand is among the most forested states of India with more than 45% forest cover (FSI 2017), with Chir pine forests as the major forest type. Recently, anthropogenic activity (e.g., hydropower construction, extension of road, installation of transmission lines) resulting in extensive deforestation and fragmentation of the forests in the Garhwal Himalaya caused serious environmental degradation (Roy and Tomar 2000;Sharma and Roy 2007;Kumar andSharma 2016, 2018;Kumar and Pandey 2017;Batar et al. 2017). According to Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), in Uttarakhand, 44,868 ha of forest land has been changed into non-forest use since 1980 and around 9500 ha has been felled for construction of roads, followed by 5500 ha for hydro-projects and 3100 ha for installation of transmission lines (Batar et al. 2017). Chir pine is planted in many areas as monoculture where Chir pine forests and plantations cover about 4018 km 2 in the western Himalaya (Seth, 1980). Chir pine in Himalaya plays a major role in carbon sequestration (Kumar and Pandey 2017;Kumar and Sharma 2017a).",
        "45190836-ad47-4f3d-94e1-ad4781bb3be9": "Out of total of 24,414.80 km 2 area under forests, Chir pine occupies 3,943.83 km 2 which is 16.15% of total forest area of the state (Kumar 2015). Chir pine is a major commercial species used for afforestation in subtropical Himalayan regions in India and Nepal (Amatya, 2002;Sharam and Verma 2011). It has also great potential for GHG emission reduction and livelihood promotion projects for maximum utilization of carbon market (Sharam and Verma 2011; Kumar et al. 2017bKumar et al. , 2019a)). Chir pine occupies a broader range of habitats such as sandy and loamy soils. Moreover, it needs poor nutrition to an unfertile area usually not suitable for agriculture practices and even other species occupying area. Generally, it has characteristics to grow in all categories of soil, i.e., acidic, neutral, and basic (Singh et al. 2017) and thus potential for wide adaptability in the areas and therefore large forest cover. In Uttarakhand, Chir pine has been utilized for several raw materials both commercial and traditional purposes in national and international demand. It has been reported that the tree is used for construction, fencing post, ornamental purposes, and many societal needs (Silori et al., 2013). Chir pine grows well in the tough terrain in the Garhwal Himalaya and helps in reducing soil erosion and landslide on a steep gradient. If the Chir pine is removed, it will expose the area to different environmental dimensions, and frequent landslide may occur which will lead to devastating effect of the study area. The inflammable capacity of its litter is also promoting fire especially during the hot summer season which may further cause devastating effects in the entire forest area. It affects biodiversity and new growing seedling and creates problems for the regeneration of forest. These Chir pine forests provide favorable habitat for several medicinally important species having high value in market.",
        "40cd9f02-69a3-4413-85d9-8860ecf3cf17": "Further, it has also been noticed that the smoke produced through fire has also negative impact on forest, wildlife, and many other issues of forests. However, trees have huge potential to sustain life support in these forests, providing many valuable products (small timber from lopping, big timber through harvesting, producing resin) including medicine and other purposes. Thus, instead of harmful impact, it has a beneficial impact on human as well as environmental. The clean and huge bole system of the tree compared to other trees in this location has huge carbon storing potential and provides further regional and global carbon mitigation potential. Chir pine forests have biomass ranging of 150 t ha -1 to 200 t ha -1 (Singh and Singh 1992). Much of this carbon (60% -90%) is stored in the vegetation while the upper 30 cm of soil accounts for 10% -40% of sequestered carbon in Chir pine forests (Pant and Tiwari, 2014). Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic matter (SOM), and their correlations with bulk density are frequently used to estimate carbon pools (Post et al. 1982). Therefore, keeping in view the importance of Chir pine trees and its extensive distribution along altitudes in Garhwal Himalaya, the hypothesis is developed that carbon storage potential of Chir pine forest affects with altitudes with the research questions that what is the carbon storing potential of Chir pine forest with altitudes in Garhwal Himalaya. Therefore, to understand the questions and proof the hypothesis, the following objectives have been selected for the study that; (i) to understand the carbon storing potential of Chir pine forest in Garhwal Himalaya and (ii) to understand the effect of altitudes on carbon storing potential of Chir pine forest.",

The rate and factors determining the recovery of this C pool with afforestation are still poorly understood. This paper provides a review of the influence of afforestation on SOC stocks based on a meta-analysis of 33 recent publications (totaling 120 sites and 189 observations), with the aim of determining the factors responsible for the restoration of SOC following afforestation. Based on a mixed linear model, the meta-analysis indicates that the main factors that contribute to restoring SOC stocks after afforestation are: previous land use, tree species planted, soil clay content, preplanting disturbance and, to a lesser extent, climatic zone. Specifically, this meta-analysis (1) indicates that the positive impact of afforestation on SOC stocks is more pronounced in cropland soils than in pastures or natural grasslands; (2) suggests that broadleaf tree species have a greater capacity to accumulate SOC than coniferous species; (3) underscores that afforestation using pine species does not result in a net loss of the whole soil-profile carbon stocks compared with initial values (agricultural soil) when the surface organic layer is included in the accounting; (4) demonstrates that clay-rich soils (433%) have a greater capacity to accumulate SOC than soils with a lower clay content (o33%); (5) indicates that minimizing preplanting disturbances may increase the rate at which SOC stocks are replenished; and (6) suggests that afforestation carried out in the boreal climate zone results in small SOC losses compared with other climate zones, probably because trees grow more slowly under these conditions, although this does not rule out gains over time after the conversion. This study also highlights the importance of the methodological approach used when developing the sampling design, especially the inclusion of the organic layer in the accounting.",
        "8bd3daf7-0233-4924-ae9e-31c1b15fbdd8": "The carbon (C) contained in forest ecosystems accounts for a major proportion of the global terrestrial C stocks. It is estimated that the forest biomass contains more than 80% of all global C contained in the aboveground biomass and that forest soils contain more than 70% of the C contained in soils (Batjes, 1996;Jobbagy & Jackson, 2000;Six et al., 2002a). Historically, terrestrial C pools have declined significantly due to land use changes and in particular due to deforestation, i.e. the conversion of forest environments to agricultural land (Jandl et al., 2007). Following their transition to agricultural uses, forest environments experience a dramatic decline in C in response to the removal of plant biomass and the decrease in organic matter inputs to the soil consistent with deforestation, but also as a result of increased decomposition and erosion caused by soil disturbance (Six et al., 2000;Murty et al., 2002;Lal, 2005;McLauchlan, 2006). On the other hand, the conversion of treeless land not previously forested into a plantation (afforestation sensu, Evans, 1992) has been cited as an effective method for reducing the atmospheric CO 2 concentration because of the ability to sequester C in vegetation and soil (IPCC, 2001;Jandl et al., 2007). Afforestation usually results in the establishment of a higher plant biomass that is perennial and has a longer rotation compared with crop plants that are harvested annually. In the soil, the presence of trees modifies the quality and quantity of litter inputs and microclimatic conditions such as moisture and temperature (Bouwman & Leemans, 1995). In addition, the cessation of tillage operations (plowing) generally reduces disturbance and provides better protection of soil organic carbon (SOC) against decomposition (Six et al., 2000;Del Galdo et al., 2003). The transition from agricultural soil to forest soil is also accompanied by a change in the soil microbial and faunal communities.",

Soil has a great capacity to store C; it contains more C than the combined amount present in both living plant biomass and atmospheric CO 2 (Jobbagy & Jackson, 2000). The residence time of stable fractions of SOC can be 41000 years (von Lutzow et al., 2006), making it a much more stable sink than living plant biomass, given that the average rotation time can be as short as 10 years, for example, for Eucalyptus globulus plantations in southwestern Australia (Mendham et al., 2003). Despite the considerable SOC sequestration potential that afforestation offers, many studies have reported contradictory findings. Afforestation resulted in either a decrease (Parfitt et al., 1997;Perrott et al., 1999;Ross et al., 1999;Farley et al., 2004) or an increase in SOC stocks (Del Galdo et al., 2003;Lemma et al., 2006;Gru \u00a8nzweig et al., 2007), or had a negligible effect (Bashkin & Binkley, 1998;Chen et al., 2000;Davis, 2001;Davis et al., 2007;Smal & Olszewska, 2008).",
        "2130a9e2-ccbd-4901-b255-698a2fc00da0": "Nevertheless, a trend appears to emerge: afforestation frequently shows an initial loss in SOC during the first few years, followed by a gradual return of C stocks to levels comparable to those in the control agricultural soil, and then increasing to generate net C gains in some cases (Romanya et al., 2000;Paul et al., 2002;Vesterdal et al., 2002;Turner et al., 2005;Wang et al., 2006;Davis et al., 2007;Huang et al., 2007;Ritter, 2007), but often lower than the values in a comparable natural forest (DeGryze et al., 2004;Smal & Olszewska, 2008). Apart from that, there is still no consensus in the scientific community concerning the factors determining the restoration of SOC stocks following afforestation. The balance between C inputs in the form of litter (aboveground and belowground) and losses through decomposition determines whether the ecosystem is a sink or a source of C. Evaluating the C dynamics of this type of system requires data on the size of the C pool, the magnitude of the C input and output fluxes, as well as information about the mechanisms involved in controlling flux dynamics. To promote the C sink status of tree plantations, it is therefore imperative to determine the mechanisms involved in controlling SOC dynamics and more specifically in the storage of C in the soil after afforestation. To date, three literature reviews have been devoted completely (Paul et al., 2002) or partly to this question (Post & Kwon, 2000;Guo & Gifford, 2002). Despite the limited number of studies available at that time, Paul et al. (2002) identified previous land use as the main determining factor, followed by climate and species planted, while Post & Kwon (2000) identified plant productivity, soil physical and biological properties, the history of C inputs and physical soil disturbance.",

However, when afforestation takes place on cropland, restoration of SOC stocks does occur. Unfortunately, much of the data used in the reviews cited above are derived from studies that were not designed specifically to investigate the question of the mechanisms involved in the dynamics of SOC stocks following afforestation (Paul et al., 2002). Also, given the limited number of studies available, some SOC stock estimates were made using approximated soil bulk density values in cases where the authors provided only the SOC concentrations. Consequently, the conclusions drawn from these literature reviews are limited by inappropriate experimental designs, sampling methods and/or soil analysis techniques (Paul et al., 2002). Since the publication of these reviews, more than 20 additional studies have been published. The availability of new studies designed specifically to answer this question provides an opportunity to more accurately test the involvement of these factors in the restoration of SOC stocks following afforestation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the recovery of SOC stocks following afforestation of an agricultural soil. To achieve this objective, a series of factors known to affect soil C dynamics were selected and these factors are analyzed statistically using 33 recent publications (o20 years) specifically designed to answer this question. After a review of the literature on the subject, the following variables were chosen: (1) previous land use (cropland, pasture, natural grassland), (2) climatic zone, (3) soil properties (clay content, pH), (4) management options (preplanting disturbance, plantation density and tree species planted) and ( 5) methodological approaches (study design, sampling depth, plantation age, inclusion of the organic layer and of particles 42 mm). Each factor selected is examined in a separate section.",

To analyze consequences of an increase in forest cover, this study investigates possible trade-offs between carbon storage and plant biodiversity caused by afforestation. Six afforestation scenarios with total forest cover ranging from 27.7% to 46% were generated in the Mulde river basin in Saxony with regard to different forest types. Carbon storage was calculated by the process-based Dynamic Vegetation Model LPJ-GUESS while random forest models were used to predict changes in plant species richness. We used eight different plant groups as responses: total number of plant species, endangered species, as well as species grouped by native status (three groups) and pollination traits (three groups). Afforestation led to an increase in carbon storage that was slightly stronger in coniferous forests as compared to deciduous forests. The relationship between plant species richness and afforestation was context dependent. Species richness showed a non-linear relationship with forest cover share. The relationship was influenced by shares of land use types, climatic conditions and land use configuration expressed by the number of land use patches. The effect of forest type on plant species richness was marginal. On average the relationship between carbon storage and plant species richness was synergistic for most plant groups. However, the relationship between change in species richness and change in carbon storage varied across space. This changing relationship was used to identify priority areas for afforestation. The different plant groups responded differently to an increase in forest cover. The change in species richness for Red List species was relatively distinct from the other species groups. Neophytes and archeophytes (i.e. alien plant species introduced after and before the discovery of the Americas) showed a similar response to the afforestation scenarios. While afforestation had overall positive effects both on plant species richness and carbon storage, a number of locations were identified for which afforestation would lead to a decrease in plant species richness. Spatial planning should therefore avoid afforestation at these locations.",

Land systems typically provide a number of ecosystem goods and services (ES) in parallel (Foley et al., 2005) and changes in land use can cause shifts in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services. Envi-ronmental planning shall aim at improving several ES or landscape services at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the different direct and indirect effects of land use on the different ES. While synergistic relationships between different ES and between ES and biodiversity have been described in several studies we have to face the fact that many decisions will lead to trade-offs instead of win-win situations (Howe et al., 2014;McShane et al., 2011). Quantifying these relationships between land use options and ES and biodiversity has become a major topic in ES research (Bennett et al., 2009;Howe et al., 2014;Lee and Lautenbach, 2016;Mouchet et al., 2014;Seppelt et al., 2011). The conducted analyses are performed either with a focus on the spatial domain (analyzing which ES and biodiversity indicators occur together) or on management options (analyzing changes in ES and biodiversity caused by the different options). The bundles approach uses maps of ES provisioning to identify clusters of ES and biodiversity indicators that co-occur (Raudsepp-Hearne et al., 2010). Frequently, it is based on synthetic indices (Kienast et al., 2009;Maes et al., 2012;Plieninger et al., 2013), bivariate correlation analysis (Casalegno et al., 2013;Jopke et al., 2015) or multivariate statistics (Crouzat et al., 2015;Dick et al., 2014;Haines-Young et al., 2012;Lavorel and Grigulis, 2012).",

In some studies the quantification of trade-offs based on biophysical models has been thereby combined with a trade-off analysis after biophysical indicators had been transferred to monetary terms (Dymond et al., 2012;Gr\u00eat-Regamey et al., 2014;Kragt and Robertson, 2014). In addition to the analysis of a set of predefined scenarios or management options, optimization approaches (Herzig et al., 2013;Lautenbach et al., 2014Lautenbach et al., , 2013;;Seppelt et al., 2013) or multicriteria decision analysis tools (Sanon et al., 2012) are used to identify Pareto-optimal solutions and to describe trade-offs based on them. On the one hand provisioning services and regulating services such as food provisioning and carbon sequestration tend to tradeoff in general (Cimon-Morin et al., 2013;de Groot et al., 2010) while relationships between regulating services are mainly synergistic (Lee and Lautenbach, 2016). Studies on the relationship between biodiversity and carbon sequestration on the other hand have revealed different relationships: strong trade-offs as well as no-effects and synergistic relationships have been found. Partly, this pattern could be explained by scale dependent effects as well as by the land system analyzed: at global scale the relationship was mostly synergistic since especially tropical rainforests are both a major hotspot for biodiversity as well as important for carbon sequestration (Larsen et al., 2011;Luck et al., 2009;Siikam\u00e4ki and Newbold, 2012;Strassburg et al., 2010).",

For the relationship between carbon sequestration and freshwater biodiversity Holland et al. (2011) found a positive association at the national scale in England and Wales with significant differences at the scale of river basin districts. Scale and land system in the study region are not the only factors that have been found to influence the relationship between carbon sequestration and biodiversity. As shown by Eigenbrod et al. (2010) the use of land cover based proxies instead of raw data tends to wrongly amplify trade-off relationships between carbon sequestration and biodiversity and other ES. In addition, it can be expected that results differ among different biodiversity indicators (Feld et al., 2009;Lavorel and Grigulis, 2012). While it is important to identify general trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon sequestration or carbon storage, for management purposes, it is also important to know if trade-offs differ in space, e.g. due to different environmental conditions such as climate, soil or terrain or due to different land systems or land use intensity. If trade-offs differ in space this can be used to identify priority areas for ES and/or biodiversity conservation (Luck et al., 2012). In this study, we aim to estimate the relationship between carbon storage and plant species richness for eight plant groups in the Mulde basin, Saxony, Germany to provide recommendations for future adjustments of the afforestation program of the Saxonian Ministry for the Environment and Agriculture (S\u00e4chsisches Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt und Landwirtschaft, 2007).",

The goal to increase forest cover to 30% has been set at the level of the Free State of Saxonyregional planning agencies can set different goals for an increase in forest cover for their planning regions since trade-offs are likely to differ in space. We considered the effect of afforestation between 27.7% (additional 40.2 km 2 of forest) and 46% (additional 476.8 km 2 of forest) for our case study, the Mulde basin. This range of scenarios allows an exploration of the effects of possible planning decisions. Our analysis provides relevant information for stakeholders and decision makers to assess the likely effects of different spatial allocation schemes for afforestation with respect to carbon storage and plant species richness. We used a watershed as the case study region delineation to allow in a follow-up study to incorporate the analysis of hydrological services and food provisioning in the current trade-off analysis. A main difference of the work presented here to existing studies was the focus on the spatial heterogeneity of the trade-offs between plant species richness and carbon storage at the regional scale. We based our analysis on biophysical and statistical models that should overcome limitations of studies that based their analysis on scoring approaches such as the work by Hall et al. (2012). Furthermore we analyzed trade-offs with respect to different plant species groups instead of relying on total plant species richness.

Comparing model results for soil carbon at the global scale (Stockmann et al., 2013) LPJ-GUESS estimates have been reported to be at the low end of estimates. Absolute values of carbon stock changes should therefore be interpreted with care. However, it seems unlikely that the differences between soil-climate and soil texture regions and land use classes would change so much that they would lead to differ- ent conclusions. The trade-offs between carbon storage and plant species richness depend for carbon on the differences in soil carbon between regions and between land use classes rather than absolute values. Results from the biodiversity models were generally in line with results from previous studies.

The increase of species numbers with habitat diversity indicated by the number of land use patches and by the variance of climatic conditions is also in line with results by K\u00fchn et al.

Our results indicate that for our case study carbon storage primarily depended on forest fraction, secondarily on forest type and only marginally (probably indirectly) on the environmental conditions such as soil type or climate. So if the objective is to increase carbon storage it would not be of great importance where additional forest would be grown. This stands in contrast to plant species richness: environmental conditions as well as the share of forest cover, the shares of other land use classes and land use composition played a marked role. In addition, models for the different species groups identified different responses towards the predictors. Forest cover type was of intermediate importance for the eight species richness groups. An increase in forest cover share had a negative marginal effect on species richness. For all three pollination traits and for indigenous plant species the negative effect kicked in for forest cover shares greater than about 40%. Red List species showed a humped relationship with forest cover share -the negative effect kicked in at a forest cover share greater than 75%. Positive effects of more diverse landscape configuration were indicated by the positive marginal effects of the number of patches -this is in line with findings by (Deutschewitz et al., 2003). As indicated by the effect plots (SI 4) interactions between predictors should be taken into account. From a spatial planning perspective the trade-off between carbon storage and food production could be tackled by simply aiming at afforestation areas at locations with a poor agricultural potential. Incentives in this case would not have to be spatially adjusted -under the assumption of rational choice behavior of landowners one would assume that agriculture under poor conditions would be first abandoned and afforested if the incentive would be high enough. Considering trade-offs with biodiversity spatial planning would become much more challenging, even if just one indicator of species diversity would be chosen, since several factors would have to be taken into account: the forest cover in a region should not become too high while the optimal forest cover for a species group differs with respect to other predictors such as climatic con- We showed further that different groups of species favor different positions in environmental space.",

Instead, planning should be based on models for the species group in focusclearly Red List species and indigenous species are the groups of most concern with respect to nature conservation. From the perspective of landscape aesthetics and recreation potential colorful flowers might be at stake (Lindemann-Matthies et al., 2010) -plants which are usually insect pollinated. Indeed, they have been assigned a significant value by choice experiments in the UK (Breeze et al., 2015). Our analysis aimed at the regional scale (10 3 -10 5 sqkm) and should therefore not be misused for local scale decisions. Both car-bon storage and biodiversity most likely are influenced by many local conditions such as soil (Diekmann et al., 2015), as well as by the management of the forest patches (e.g. Cunningham et al., 2015). We have simulated only the effect of environmental conditions and land cover configuration and composition on plant biodiversity at the regional scale and ignored thereby effects of forest management which have been shown to be of importance for forest biodiversity (Paillet et al., 2010) and for carbon storage (Noormets et al., 2015). Land use intensity and presence of green linear elements could not be taken into account due to data deficiency. These factors, however, are of major importance for high nature quality indicator species (Liira et al., 2008) as well as for animal species richness (Dormann et al., 2007). While the influence of landscape configuration was tested we were not able to include information on land use intensity because this information was not available. The protection status and the type of forest there intended as a proxy for land use intensityonly protection status had some effect on some the species richness of some plant groups. Presumably forest management is too diverse across the different forest types to affect plant species richness at our scale. Furthermore, different taxonomic groups respond differently (Br\u00e4uniger et al., 2010), so that there hardly is a one-size-fits-all solution.",

Clearly changing climate conditions would change carbon sequestration and plant species richness pattern so care should be taken when interpreting our results. Results for carbon storage across the three soil-climatic regions indicate that relative differences between the land use classes presumably would not change too much. For plant species richness spatially varying effects of changes in climate have to be expected as indicated by the marginal plots and the effect plots (cf. SI 4). Further research in this direction is encouraged. Still trade-offs derived under current climatic conditions indicate spatial pattern in trade-offs that are helpful for regional planning. Our analysis did further not account for the specific land-use history of the land used for afforestation. Different LU histories significantly alter nutrient availability and soil characteristics thereby influencing the re-growth forests and their carbon storage. Results from Caspersen et al. (2000) for the USA indicated carbon storage could be effected by 2 \u00b1 4.4% -while this is a significant difference it would presumably not change the direction of our results. By building models on species numbers we are likely to have missed specifics of the ecological characteristics of individual plant species. While it seems beneficial at first glance to model the ecological niche of individual plant species and to sum those up afterwards or to calculate a different index this is hindered by the fact that only for a few species the distributions data is sufficient to allow for niche modeling. We would only be able to model the most widespread species which are not of most concern to protect biodiversity. A drawback of our approach is that two sites with the same number of species but a different species composition get the same value. This might be a reason why our models failed to spot differences between the different forest typesthe response only reflects the number of species and not species composition.",

The selection of our groups reflects important traits, the protection status and the native status and goes thereby beyond simpler approaches that model only total plant species richness. Still, it would be worth to investigate models that differentiate between additional traits. Another aspect that has not been investigated is the effect of diversifying afforestation policy to avoid the transformation of certain land use categories into forests. Lehsten et al. (2015) have shown that, at a European scale, grasslands as a species rich land use category are expected to experience the highest decrease in areal extent in the next decades. Broadleaved forests are expected to increase both at the expense of farmland as well as at the expense of grasslands (see S6 of Lehsten et al. (2015)). Since we do not expect an effect of current land use on carbon stock change due to afforestation, afforestation programs should explicitly try to prevent the afforestation of grasslands and promote the afforestation of farmlands to counteract this continental trend.",

There have been increasing efforts to reforest these cleared lands to achieve both socio-economic and environmental objectives. To date, planted forests have been dominated by monocultures. There has however been increasing calls to use mixtures of species, although there is limited evidence to support mixed-species plantations being a better or win-win approach to reforestation. To address this, we compared the tree growth, forest structure, and tree species diversity performance of monoculture and mixed-species tree plantations across 168 sites (251 survey plots) on Leyte Island, the Philippines. Our results indicate that mixtures of fast-growing exotics species had better growth performance compared to monocultures of fast-growing exotics species, and also better tree species diversity performance at both the plot and landscape scale. Our results suggest that mixtures of exotic or native species can provide benefits over monoculture plantations. Mixtures of productive exotic species are most suited to situations where the production function of the forest is most important, while mixtures of native species are most suited to situations where the biodiversity function of the forest is most important.",

For example, the Philippines has experienced extensive deforestation over recent decades and up to 59% (9.3 million ha) of the country's official forest lands are not forested at present, being either grassland, shrubland, or under cultivation (Chokkalingam et al., 2006). The rapid loss of tropical forests has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and serious environmental, social, and economic impacts because of the reliance of local populations on forest products and ecosystem services provided by forests (Dudley et al., 2005). To address these negative impacts, large-scale reforestation programs have been implemented across many developing countries, for example, the United Nations Billion Tree Campaign (UNEP, 2012). The total tropical forest plantation area more than doubled in the period 1995-2005 (from 32.2 million ha to 67.5 million ha) with an average annual growth of 8.6% (FAO, 2006;STCP, 2009). The highest growth rate was in the Asia-Pacific region at 9.4% per year, and the slowest was in Latin America and the Caribbean at 4.3% per year (STCP, 2009). In the Philippines, the national government is currently investing heavily in the reforestation of denuded areas through the Philippine National Greening Program (NGP, 2011) and therefore requires information on the most appropriate reforestation approaches. The most common way to reforest cleared areas where natural regeneration is no longer a viable option is to plant monocultures of fast-growing exotic species (Erskine et al., 2006;Evans & Turnbull, 2004;Kelty, 2006;Kanowski, 2018;Lamb et al., 2001;Lugo, 1997;Stephens & Wagner, 2007).",

A principal advantage of monocultures over mixedspecies forests is the ability to concentrate all site resources on the growth of a species with desirable characteristics (generally faster growth rates for the same wood quality), the simplicity of stand management, and product uniformity (Evans & Turnbull, 2004;Kelty, 2006;Siry et al., 2005). Despite the extensive use and ease of establishment, there are many concerns regarding the continued expansion of monocultures due to their low species diversity (Carnevale & Montagnini, 2002;Kohli et al., 1996;Lamb, 1998;Stephens & Wagner, 2007), susceptibility to disturbances such as fire and pests (Jactel & Brockerhoff, 2007;Nichols et al., 1999;Riihim\u00e4ki et al., 2005), low resource-use efficiency (Cannell, 1999;D\u00fcnisch et al., 2003;Evans, 1999;Khanna, 1997), and low level of product diversification (Lamb, 1998;Lamb et al., 2005;Odoom, 2002).

Research has shown that when mixed-species plantations are appropriately designed, they offer a number of potential advantages, such as the potential to restore degraded areas by improving nutrient cycling and soil fertility (Binkley et al., 2003;Guariguata et al., 1995;Lamb, 1998;2011;McNamara et al., 2006;Wormald, 1992), enhancing biodiversity (Butterfield & Malvido, 1992;Carnevale & Montagnini, 2002;Hartley, 2002;Stephens & Wagner, 2007), higher stand productivity (Debell et al., 1997;Erskine et al., 2006;Forrester et al., 2006;2007;Lamb, 2011;Parrotta & Knowles, 1999;Potvin & Gotelli, 2008;Richards et al., 2010), and better resistance to pests and diseases (Hung et al., 2011;Jactel & Brockerhoff, 2007;Kaitaniemi et al., 2007;Lamb, 2011;Montagnini et al., 1995;Riihim\u00e4ki et al., 2005).",

Despite the respective benefits and drawbacks of monocultures and mixed-species plantations, few studies have compared the performance of different reforestation strategies. Here we compare three approaches of planted forest reforestation used within the Philippines, namely monoculture plantations, mixed introduced species plantations, and mixed native species plantations. For each reforestation approach, we measured the growth performance, structure, and tree species diversity (as all plantations types have recruited additional understory tree species and in the case of the older plantations even overstory species) in order to assess the relative ability of each approach to provide the joint benefits of timber production and biodiversity conservation. The results of the study can provide the basis for selecting appropriate reforestation approaches to achieve objectives of sustainable forest management in the study area in particular and in tropical developing countries in general.",

The species in the mixed introduced species plantations (i.e., Gmelina arborea, Acacia mangium, Swietenia macrophylla) are commonly planted elsewhere (i.e., a relatively small number of fast-growing exotic species planted together). The mixed native species plantations, although different in species composition to other countries, are also typical of the type of planting systems put in place for mixtures of native species (i.e., a large number of native species planted in high densities in a random assemblage) (G\u00f6ltenboth, 2011), and with species selection largely driven by available germplasm (N. Gregorio et al., 2017;N. O. Gregorio et al., 2005;Takoutsing et al., 2014). Overall we found that mixtures of introduced or native species can provide benefits over monoculture plantations across a number of key indicators. However, mixed-species plantations are more difficult to establish and manage compared to monocultures of wellknown species due to limited knowledge about appropriate design and management of mixed-species plantations (Dickinson et al., 2008). As a result, mixed-species plantations comprise less than 0.1% of industrial plantations worldwide (Nichols et al., 2006). Our results suggest that the use of mixed introduced species will tend to favor the 'production' function of plantations while the use of mixed native species favors the 'biodiversity' function of plantations. Mixtures (both of native and exotic species) as a whole, however, result in more structurally complex and biodiverse forests compared to monocultures. Reforestation in tropical developing countries needs to strike a balance between timber production and biodiversity conservation because people depend on forest products for their living. In many cases, the production function is considered most important by those relying on trees for their livelihoods. Our study suggests that when this is the case, revegetation using mixed plantings of productive introduced species may strike the most appropriate balance between production and biodiversity.",
        "b7de82c7-e0b5-4fd6-b7aa-b5f32483bb32": "The use of mixed introduced species may be a good alternative for small or medium-sized farms because mixtures of two to three species can provide diversification of forest products. Where biodiversity conservation is a specific goal of revegetation, then mixed native species plantings would be preferable. Our results indicate that plantations of mixed introduced species performed best for most forest growth performance indices and some forest structure performance indices, while plantations of mixed native species performed best for tree species diversity. Monoculture plantations only out-performed mixed introduced and mixed native species plantations for one tree growth performance indicator (MAI Ht) and some forest structure performance indicators (the density of woody stems for height 10-20 m, shrub cover, vines and scramblers cover, and coarse woody debris cover). Monoculture plantations tended to perform better than mixed native species plantations for tree growth performance indices, however not significantly better. Our finding shows the same results as previous studies. The main reasons for this finding are first that planting many species in mixed stands could reduce pest and disease problems (Chokkalingam et al., 2006) while for a monoculture plantation, the risk of attack by insects is always there, whether the species is native or exotic (Wylie, 2002). Nair (2001) indicates that large monoculture plantations are most susceptible to pest outbreaks, and susceptibility in the Philippines. The next reason is the biological characteristics of forest trees. The results from case studies in the Amazon region also indicate that initially the growth of monoculture plantations was greater, but as mixed native species began to get larger, their rate of growth increased. The increase was due to partly to decreased competition from herbaceous weeds and grasses, and partly to an increasingly efficient use of light and nutrients (Montagnini & Jordan, 2005).",

Other studies have compared mixed-species plantations with monoculture plantations and have shown that mixtures can be highly productive (Binkley et al., 1992;Bristow et al., 2006;Debell et al., 1997;Forrester et al., 2005;Kelty, 1989;Nadrowski et al., 2010;Piotto, 2008;Potvin & Dutilleul, 2009;Potvin & Gotelli, 2008). Further studies have reported that the effect of tree diversity on growth performance may be positive in young stands (Erskine et al., 2006) or negative in old stands (Firn et al., 2007). Some species may also grow better in mixed stands while others grow better in monocultures (Piotto et al., 2003a;Redondo-Brenes & Montagnini, 2006). Forrester et al. (2004) stated that when positive interactions are dominant (facilitation or competitive reduction), mixed stands can be more productive than monocultures; however, if the inter-specific competition is greater than these positive interactions, mixtures will be less productive. There is growing evidence that some multi-species plantations can have greater levels of productivity than monoculture plantations of their constituent species (Biot et al., 1995;Cannell et al., 1992;Forrester et al., 2006;Kelty, 2006;Jones et al., 2005;Piotto, 2008).",

Forrester et al. (2007) also reported that mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mearnsii were twice as productive as Eucalyptus globulus monocultures growing on the same site in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. A meta-analysis carried out by Piotto (2008) comparing tree growth in monocultures and mixed plantations found that mixing tree species generally increases plantation growth. Piotto et al. (2010) also found that mixed native plantations on degraded pasturelands in humid Costa Rica performed better than monoculture native plantations for all growth variables, including height, diameter at breast height, volume, and aboveground biomass. A further study in Costa Rica compared the same experimental pure and mixed-species plantations and found that mixed plantations had productivities either similar to or greater than the same species grown in monocultures (Petit & Montagnini, 2004;Piotto et al., 2003a;2003b). However, studies have found that mixtures tend to outperform monocultures on poor sites (Binkley, 1992;Montagnini et al., 1995), whereas monocultures of a highly productive species can have higher merchantable yields on highquality sites (Burkhart & Tham, 1992;Kelty, 1992). Productivity increases in mixed-species plantations can be the result of a number of different mechanisms including complementarity, facilitation, and sampling effect. The complementarity hypothesis proposes that species-rich plantations are able to more efficiently access and utilize limited resources because they contain species with a diverse array of ecological attributes (Kelty, 1992). As a consequence, more diverse plantations should have higher net primary production, and in a well-managed plantation, this should translate into larger timber volumes.",
        "761f8360-f992-4989-8e25-95fb8c5d6c1c": "The facilitation hypothesis suggests that mixed-species plantations improve growing conditions (i.e., nitrogen-fixing trees) for other species, which facilitates increases in overall production of a mixed-species stand (Binkley et al., 2003;Forrester et al., 2006;Parrotta, 1999). Alternatively, the sampling effect hypothesis proposes that more diverse plantations demonstrate increased production because they have a higher chance of containing species that are \"over-yielding\" and highly efficient in their use of limited resources. That is, one or two species within the community are largely responsible for any increase in production (Loreau et al., 2001). The results of our study do not point to the exact mechanism by which mixed-species plantations achieved greater productivity than monocultures; however, the mixed introduced species plantations surveyed in our study did include nitrogen fixers (Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, and Leucaena leucocephala Lam.), which suggests that facilitation may have been one reason for the higher productivity observed in mixed introduced species plantations. The expression of complementarity in tree stands generally depends on species-specific plant traits, the combination of planted species, and the availability of limited resources at a planting site (Grant et al., 2006;Forrester et al., 2005;Rothe & Binkley, 2001). Complementarity may become more important with increasing resource utilization during tree development (Delagrange et al., 2008;Forrester et al., 2006;Stanley & Montagnini, 1999). Richards et al. (2010) found that more than 50% of mixed-species studies reported a higher above-ground nutrient content compared to monocultures, indicating an increase in the proportion of resources captured from a site. Second, a metaanalysis showed that foliar N concentrations significantly increased for a given species in a mixture containing N 2 -fixing species, compared to a monoculture, suggesting higher rates of photosynthesis and greater resource-use efficiency.",

Such shifts can result from changes in canopy photosynthetic capacities, changes in carbon allocation, or changes to foliar nutrient residence times of species in a mixture (Richards et al., 2010). In terms of forest structural performance, our study indicates that while mixed introduced species plantations performed best for several indices (medium to large tree density, canopy cover, and litter cover), monoculture plantations performed better for other indices (medium height tree density, shrub cover, vines and scramblers, and coarse woody debris), and structural performance was highly dependent on stand age. The development of structural complexity with stand age was most strikingly evident in monoculture plantations. While most young monoculture plantations had a relatively open canopy, an understorey of grass, herbs, and low litter cover, old monoculture plantations had a relatively complex structure, with higher canopy and litter cover, and significantly less grass cover. In part, this is simply a consequence of the maturity of trees, leading to larger diameter woody stems, greater canopy cover, litter, and woody debris. The link between plantation structural complexity and age has been noted elsewhere (Kanowski et al., 2003) and studies have found that structural complexity increased with stand age no matter how many species are planted at establishment (Munro et al., 2009). Whilst structural complexity generally increased with age for all plantation types, our results indicate that tree species diversity did not necessarily increase with age. For instance, both the tree species richness and Simpson's diversity index decreased with stand age in mixed introduced plantations, while they significantly increased in monoculture plantations. The reason for this appears to be two-fold. The reduction in diversity in mixed-species plantations was due to a combination of anthropogenic factors associated with harvesting of mainly fast-growing exotic species and high mortality rates of lightdemanding species due to competition (Nguyen et al., 2014;Wills et al., 2016).",
        "16e5c18c-e8ce-4034-9773-98dec58a6b66": "Other studies have also found that whilst plantation structural complexity increases with age, tree species richness does not necessarily increase (Finegan, 1996;Mar\u00edn-Spiotta et al., 2007;Wilkins et al., 2003). This pattern may indicate that plantations can provide habitat for fauna in the form of structural complexity, but may not provide sites for the conservation of plants unless they are specifically planted or seed is introduced (E. Brockerhoff et al., 2008;Munro et al., 2009). The reason for the observed increase in tree species diversity with age in monoculture plantations could be that as the monoculture plantations matured, they provided habitat for other tree species and animals that disperse the seeds of new species (E. Brockerhoff et al., 2008;E. G. Brockerhoff et al., 2013). Observations of plantation understories in Puerto Rico suggest that high tree species richness can occur under monoculture stands and that reestablishment of tree species richness on degraded sites with arrested succession can be facilitated through monoculture plantings (Lugo, 1997). Munro et al. (2007) stated that there is currently an absence of information on how revegetation structure and floristic diversity develops, particularly under different vegetation establishment techniques. This information is important for understanding the biodiversity value of revegetation and for identifying establishment techniques, which will maximize the benefits of revegetation for fauna. Our results show that litter production was higher, but not significantly higher, in mixed-species plantations (both introduced and native species mixtures) compared to monoculture plantations. Other studies have indicated that higher tree productivity in mixed-species plantations could be linked to higher litter production (Potvin & Gotelli, 2008;Scherer-Lorenzen et al., 2007). Greater litter production in mixed-species plantations could increase soil nutrient supply relative to monocultures, if decomposition rates are similar. Tropical tree diversity experiments conducted by Scherer-Lorenzen et al.",

(2007) and Potvin and Gotelli (2008) have shown that both above-ground wood production and litter production were higher in mixtures than in corresponding monocultures due to inter-specific interactions influencing growth and nutrient capture, while litter decomposition rates were unaffected. Reforestation may be the best way to rehabilitate some of the most degraded areas and, at the same time, generate improvements in livelihoods and protection outcomes. There are currently a variety of reforestation forms on degraded land in tropical developing countries; however, at its simplest, there are two main ways in which reforestation can be achieved and these are by some forms of tree planting or by natural regeneration (Lamb, 2010). In which tree planting includes the following forms: pure or mixed exotic species, mixed native species forests. Each type of reforestation has its advantages and disadvantages and can be applied under different circumstances. The conditions and objectives of landowners or forest managers will determine which type of reforestation is eventually applied (Lamb, 2010). In the past, the central factor determining this choice for most industrial growers was the expected financial return. But private smallholders may take a different view. They desire the variety of forest goods and improvement of human livelihoods (Lamb, 2010). The majority of world plantation forests are monocultures with certain dominant tree species, which are favored for timber production due to the uniformity of trees and easy management. Meanwhile, mixed-species plantations are growing and becoming more popular, since they have been found to have more benefits in biodiversity, economy, forest health, and occasionally in productivity compared with monospecific plantations (Lamb, 2010;Liu et al., 2018). Natural regeneration is considered the least expensive form of reforestation, where it can occur, although its ability to produce specific goods and services varies greatly.",

Our research supports these propositions for reforestation in the Philippines, with the qualification that there appears to be differences between mixtures of native versus introduced species. We found that mixed introduced species plantations were more productive than both mixed native species and monoculture plantations; however, as plantations mature, monocultures may also result in improved biodiversity. Mixed native species plantations clearly had better outcomes in terms of tree species diversity; however, they have lower productivity, making them less suitable for timber production. Our results thus support that mixtures of introduced species are most suited to situations where the production function is considered to be most important while mixtures of native species are most suited to situations where improved biodiversity is the desired outcome.",

This study highlights changes in soil properties and stand productivity over time (1, 3, and 5 years) in an Acacia mangium plantation in Bintulu, Sarawak, Malaysia. Soil pH, total N concentration, and available P were found to decline significantly with stand age. Significant differences were observed between soil organic C for different stand ages, with the youngest stand showing the highest C. The study showed that the current A. mangium plantation was able to store 74.9, 89.9, and 138.9 t C ha -1 in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year-old stands, respectively, and soil was the main contributor for the total C pools. All soil chemical attributes showed declining trends with stand age. These declines indicated that the present management practices are not sustainable and that management inputs are necessary.",

The establishment of industrial forest plantation to restore degraded land, which results from unsupervised logging and land clearing for nonsustainable agriculture practices, and the increase of terrestrial C sequestration are some ways to alleviate the greenhouse effect (Smith et al., 2007). Land must be cleared during site preparation in order to establish forest plantations. Mechanical clearing followed by stacking and burning of forest residuals are the preferred management practices in Malaysia, as these activities are simple, fast, and effective for clearing a large area of land in a short period of time. These practices lead to various levels of soil disturbance (Cavelier et al., 1999;Certini, 2005). These include the reduction of surface organic matter, worsening of soil physical properties such as decrease in porosity and increase in bulk density, loss of nutrients through stand removal, volatilization and ash, soil loss through erosion, and destruction of soil microbial and other invertebrates that are beneficial to the forest ecosystem. In 1997, the State Government of Sarawak, Malaysia, set a target to plant 1 \u00d7 10 6 ha of forest by 2020. Until now, only 289,900 ha, or 29% of the target, has been achieved, with 12,000 ha planted in 2011 (http://www.thestar.com. my/story/?file=%2f2012%2f7%2f20%2fsarawak%2f11695 002&sec=sarawak). In order to achieve the initial target for the period 2012-2020, planting activity must be intensified to 78,900 ha year -1 . The main species used in the plantation program is Acacia mangium Willd. Even though numerous studies have examined the growth and biomass production of different tree species in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, including A. mangium, information on these attributes is still very scarce in Sarawak.",
        "aa9f72b9-cc89-49c0-be3c-ac651c72daed": "Furthermore, reports on the performance of tree species planted at an industrial scale are very limited in Sarawak. Acacia mangium is a fast-growing nitrogen fixer. It is an attractive species for plantation establishment because it grows satisfactorily even in unproductive sites. Average increment in diameter at breast height (d) could reach 3-4 cm year -1 on good sites (Awang and Taylor, 1993). The wood is suitable for many uses such as pulp and paper, particle board, woodchips, sawn timber, veneer, and plywood, as well as firewood (Lemmens et al., 1995). Sarawak is the largest state in Malaysia and is located on the island of Borneo. Most plantations in Sarawak were established in the central lowland region, which comprises elevated wave-cut platforms developed over sedimentary rocks. The Red-Yellow Podzolic soils are low in fertility and water-holding capacity. These limitations reduce the growth potential of trees. However, no report has been found to examine soil nutrient dynamics after the establishment of the forest plantation on such soil. Soil is the most essential element in sustaining the productivity of forest plantations (Bouma, 1994). Assessment of soil quality and its alteration over time is a primary indicator for sustainable forest plantation management (Arshad and Martin, 2002;Doran, 2002). There are several studies quantifying the extent and rate of soil fertility changes in forest plantations of different ages (Hardiyanto and Wicaksono, 2008;Siregar et al., 2008). Nevertheless, no study of this kind has previously been carried out in Malaysia. Fast-growing tree species such as A. mangium play a role in C sequestration, especially when they are established on a large-scale plantation. Information about the capacity of A. mangium plantations to sequester C at different ages is important.",

This study addresses the following questions: 1) Can forest plantation establishment rapidly increase soil organic carbon (SOC) on degraded Red-Yellow Podzolic soil? 2) Can soil properties, especially chemical components, be recovered to their original levels through forest plantations? 3) Can soil fertility support plantation growth and SOC accumulation?",

We compare three agroforestry systems (enriched fallows, homegardens and commercial plantations) with three spontaneous forest types (young and old secondary forests and mature rainforests) via one-way ANOVA, linear and non-linear regressions and multivariate analyses. Agroforests had significantly lower understory biomass when compared with young secondary forest. Commercial plantation agroforests had higher topsoil pH and Cacontents and homegardens had higher K-contents and P-availability hotspots, as revealed by their higher variance and single very high values. Agroforests and spontaneous forests were similar in their litter biomass (both leaves and twigs) and C:N ratio, and in soil organic matter and P contents. The overstory negatively impacted the understory (r 2 = 0.20, p \\ 0.05) and the understory correlated significantly with the litter layer (r 2 = 0.11, p \\ 0.07). By contrast, there were no direct relationships between overstory and the litter layer, pointing to a major discontinuity between vegetation and topsoil. Principal component analysis depicted a successional sequence of systems, with homegardens closest to mature rainforests. According to co-inertia analysis, plant biomass was more strongly related to topsoil in spontaneous forests than in agroforests. Altogether, agroforests were similar to mature rainforests in a wide range of variables of the vegetation, litter and topsoil, and co-inertia analysis indicated that agroforestry management can alter this continuum. Our results point to an outstanding position of homegardens in the study region, with higher aboveground biomass and elevated nutrient availability which may have been caused by the traditional sweep-and-burn low-intensity fire regime prevalent throughout Amazonia and beyond.",

After the first deforestation cycle of pristine rainforests (de las Heras et al. 2011), spontaneous regrowth of secondary forest develops on abandoned pastures and shifting cultivation fields. Shifting cultivation is the predominant land-use system adopted by the majority of low-income rural populations in the region. However, this land-use system contributes to environmental degradation, slower secondary forest regeneration, lower biodiversity, increased dominance of aggressive ruderal species, and impoverished soil fertility, altogether leading to rural poverty (Satyam Verma 2012). The soils of the humid tropics are particularly vulnerable to degradation because of fast organic matter decomposition and mineralization as well as nutrient losses caused by leaching (Markewitz et al. 2004). Degradation caused by repeated slashand-burn practice and reduced fallow periods lowers agricultural productivity and ultimately leads to rural poverty (Varma 2003). Maintenance or restoration of the soil 'productive potential' is a central pillar of sustainable land use (Boddey et al. 2003). Agroforestry has been proposed as a viable alternative for shifting cultivation in the tropics, as it can improve soil quality (Pinho et al. 2012), increase system stability (Mohri et al. 2013) and reduce economic risks because of better market flexibility via multiple products (Souza et al. 2012). Trees are a key factor for maintaining soil fertility in agroforestry due to nutrient pumping and safety-net mechanisms (Seneviratne et al. 2006). Depletion of soil nutrients as the outcome of nonsustainable land-use intensification can cause reductions in above-and belowground biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and stability (Thiele-Bruhn et al. 2012). The diversity of agroforestry systems is very large (Atangana et al. 2014); therefore, the ecological and social sustainability of these systems is likewise expected to vary widely.",

Such land-use changes usually result in loss of above-ground biomass C and SOC and consequent increases in atmospheric CO 2 (Dalal and Mayer, 1986;Brown and Lugo, 1990;Murty et al., 2002;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Don et al., 2011;Lu et al., 2018). Carbon stored within living biomass, decaying biomass and the soil of tropical forests is considered to account for about 40% of total global terrestrial C stocks (Huntingford et al., 2013;Ngo et al., 2013). Uncertainties in the magnitude of C stocks and fluxes of tropical forests however, is the largest source of error in models of the terrestrial C balance (Houghton, 2005;Pelletier et al., 2012;Mitchard et al., 2014). Estimates of the contribution of tropical deforestation to global anthropogenic emissions were at least 25% between 1980 and 1990 (Laurance, 2007) and 10% in the decade to 2010 (Achard et al., 2014). Global C fluxes from land-use change are essentially comprised of the land-use C fluxes of the tropics, with a slight reduction attributed to net removal of C by forests in Northern latitudes (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017). While deforestation continues as the dominant land-use change in the tropics, a substantial amount of agricultural land is concurrently being reverted back to forest, either through managed reforestation projects (e.g.",

As forests establish, they store more C in living vegetation, relative to the agricultural alternative (Silver et al., 2000;Fang et al., 2005;Deng et al., 2017). There have been few estimates of tree growth rates and C stocks in forests and plantations in the northern Queensland wet tropical region (Maggs and Hewett, 1993;Bristow et al., 2006;Preece et al., 2012;Preece et al., 2015). Studies in this region, however, have focused exclusively on either C in above-ground biomass (AGB) or soil in isolation, so total C stocks of these forests are poorly understood. The limited inclusion of remnant rainforest also makes assessment of changes to C pools difficult, as baseline C stocks prior to land-use change are poorly quantified. Measurement of baseline C stocks of adjacent remnant forest is important because the differences between the C stocks of remnant rainforest and agriculture are indicative of historical C losses through deforestation and sequestration potential following reforestation. Restoration of soil and debris C pools following reforestation is less predictable and highly dependent on site characteristics (Post and Kwon, 2000;Don et al., 2011;Deng et al., 2016a). The meta-analysis by Don et al. (2011) concluded that tropical land-use change hot spots, South-Eastern Asia and Africa, had relatively few studies that quantified the effects of land-use change on SOC. Don et al. (2011) reported that forest conversion to grassland resulted in an average 12% loss of SOC, conversion to cropland resulted in greater losses (i.e. 20% or more), while conversion from grassland to secondary forest resulted in a 17.5% increase in SOC at an average age of 28 years after conversion.",
        "22534faa-4482-4a07-b6d2-b070dba303ca": "Alternatively, other studies suggest there can be a decline in SOC stocks following reforestation. A global meta-analysis by Guo and Gifford (2002) reported that, on average, SOC stocks declined by 10% following conversion from pasture to plantation forest, although most declines occurred when pastures were converted to conifer plantations. The degree of change in C stocks, following land-use change, was influenced by the type of tree species planted, rainfall, time since land-use change and depth of soil sampled. These reviews suggest there is potential for soil C to be sequestered or lost when agricultural land is reverted to forest. Nevertheless, studies in tropical regions suggest that there is potential for soil C accumulation following reforestation of agricultural land (e.g. Post and Kwon, 2000;Silver et al., 2000;Don et al., 2011). The effect of land-use change on C stocks is uncertain, with magnitude and direction of soil C change dependent on numerous factors such as forest type and age, climate and soil type (Pregitzer and Euskirchen, 2004;Silver et al., 2000;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Don et al., 2011;Rabbi et al., 2015;Deng et al., 2016b). Hence, there is a need for localised studies on specific vegetation types, to help reduce the uncertainty of likely changes in C stocks associated with reforestation. The objective of this study is to quantify the impacts of land-use change from agriculture to reforested areas on ecosystem C stocks, using paired comparisons in the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. We aimed to determine, across a range of sites with varying soil types and plantation ages, whether C pools differed between agriculture and forest plantings. We hypothesised that living biomass C pools and debris pools would be higher in the reforested areas, and that the increases in these C pools in reforested areas would lead to increases in SOC, particularly in older plantings.",

Regression analysis of leaf biomass and total biomass of each branch against branch diameter (d), branch length (L), d 3 and d 2 L was conducted with functions of linear, power and exponent. A power law equation with a single parameter (d) was proved to be better than the rest for Masson pine and Chinese fir, and a linear equation with parameter (d 3 ) is better for slash pine. The canopy biomass was derived by adopting the regression equations to all branches of each individual tree. These kinds of equations were also used to fit the relationship between total tree biomass, branch biomass, foliage biomass and tree diameter at breast height (D), tree height (H), D 3 and D 2 H, respectively. D 2 H was found to be the best parameter for estimating total biomass. However, for foliage biomass and branch biomass, both parameters and equation forms showed some differences among species. Correlations were highly significant (P , 0.001) for foliage biomass, branch biomass and total biomass, among which the equation of the total biomass was the highest. With these equations, the aboveground biomass of Masson pine forest, slash pine forest and Chinese fir forest were estimated, in addition to the allocation of aboveground biomass.

Among the earth's major terrestrial biomes, forests control 80% of aboveground carbon storage and 40% of underground carbon storage (Dixon et al., 1994). Forests have the most important effect on biogeochemical cycles as well (Jiang, 1996). Previous studies also showed that most of carbon storage is in tropical and subtropical areas (Watson and Verardo, 2000). Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) are major tree species for afforestation in the subtropical area of China (Li, 1996), and slash pine was also widely cultivated in the south of China since it was introduced in the 1980s (Ren, 1997). So studying the growth law and biomass allocation of these three species is very important for estimating the total biomass and carbon fixation capacity of subtropical plantation ecosystems. There are two approaches often used to estimate biomass of terrestrial biomes, overall. One is sampling and harvesting in plots directly, and the other is estimating by other data (i.e. satellite imagery data) along with survey data indirectly (Zhou and Wang, 2003). Biomass of trees in forest ecosystems can be obtained by mean tree method or class mean sample tree method (Dong, 1997;Yu, 2003). The latter is often used to develop allometric equations. In previous studies, a lot of allometric equations for masson pine, slash pine and Chinese fir were established to estimate aboveground biomass in China, such as Feng et al. (1982), Chen et al.

Soil samples were taken from five research sites and fifteen soil properties were measured.On a 30-year basis, soil recovery differed significantly in the three regimes. The natural secondary forest regime had the highest comprehensive accumulation of about 92% and the shortest estimated recovery time (37-40 years). In contrast, the monoculture rubber plantation, despite constant fertilizer and management input, yielded the poorest recovery result of about 75% and the longest recovery time (95-100 years). From the perspective of soil recovery, this regime appears unsustainable. However, the ecological replanting using local rain forest trees and shrubs thereby to build forest structure complexity and diversity on the monoculture rubber plantation improved comprehensive accumulation ability of about 8% (from 75% to 83%) and shortened the recovery time (40 years). The results suggest that the corridor engineering by natural secondary forest regime or by ecological replanting of monoculture rubber plantation can serve as effective regimes for soil properties recovery.",

The international tropical timber organization (ITTO) estimated that 350 million ha of tropical forests has been cleared, and 500 million ha of secondary and primary tropical forests have been degraded by human activities in recent centuries (ITTO, 2002;Paul et al., 2010). A new assessment by ITTO finds that more than 90% of tropical forests are managed poorly or not at all, and natural tropical forests continue to be degraded and destroyed at a rapid pace (Blaser et al., 2011). The destruction of primary and secondary tropical forests is currently 13 million ha/year (Laurance, 2008). The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical forest ecosystems (Gardner et al., 2009;Gibson et al., 2011). The state of natural rain forests is similar in tropical China, at the northern margin of tropical SE Asia. With the rapid economic development and increased demands for natural resources such as wood and latex rubber, 139,576 ha in natural forest were cleared between 1976 and 2003 in the Xishuangbanna region of China. Natural forest decreased from 70% in 1976 to 50% in 2003, largely due to timber harvest and expansion of rubber plantations (Li et al., 2007).

Thus creating and retaining corridor is one of the most popular approaches for maintaining elephant populations and conserving biodiversity in fragmented landscapes by connecting small and isolated suitable habitat patches together (Haddad et al., 2003). To mitigate the problem of elephant extinction ensuing, the Chinese government is creating the Asian elephant conservation corridors under the supported by the biodiversity conservation corridors initiative of Asian development bank (ADB). The effort aims to connect with four mutual isolated national nature subreserves (Mengyang-Menglun-Mengla-Shangyong) by replanting engineering on the existing monoculture rubber plantations with native forest tree and shrub species and transforming the existing secondary forests in Xishuangbanna national nature reserves (XNNR), Southwest China (Fig. 1). But the changes in soil properties including nutrients and organic carbon (OC) under the monoculture rubber plantation and the Asian elephant conservation corridors remain poorly investigated. Tropical soils are believed to be more vulnerable to improper land management practices than soils in the temperate zone (Zhang et al., 2007a). Tropical deforestation and tree plantations often cause loss of soil nutrients (Duah-Yentumi et al., 1998;Zhang et al., 2010). Through intense acidification, Al dissolution, P fixation, cation depletion, and organic matter decline, the chemical degradation of tropical soils is fast and irreversible (Stocking, 2003). Rubber farming, which involves intensive human activities, has led to declining pH and organic matter content of ferralsols (Zhang and Zhang, 2005). It was reported that soil organic carbon in rubber plantations, after 40 years, was only 60% of that in old-growth forests in Ghana (Duah-Yentumi et al., 1998).",

In this study, we want to know the long-term effect of the corridors engineering on soil properties and functions recovery and predicate the soil restoration potential. We investigated the long-term performance (30 years) of two major forest types on which the corridor being built and one forest type built on rubber plantation in Xishuangbanna, to compare the soil properties and functions recovery, including: I. A 'natural secondary forest' (NSF), which was natural regrowth of woody vegetation on fallow land or marginal agricultural land with poor management. Such regrowth is typically dominated by a small number of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species that act as pioneers (Kanowski et al., 2003;Catterall et al., 2004), and this regime facilitates recruitment of a variety of late-successional species (Erskine et al., 2007). II. An 'economic tree monoculture planting plantation', which was comprised solely of one cash plant with relatively simple monoculture of selected resource tree species for timber production, resource material or other economic purposes. The monoculture rubber plantation is with intensive human activities, such as rubber tapping, fertilization, and land clearance (Zhang et al., 2007a). Rubber plantations have become a widespread landuse practice (Zhang et al., 2010) and one of the major forest recovery regimes after natural rain forest being cleared in local region. III. An 'ecological replanting forest' (ERF), a kind of replanting forest rebuilt on monoculture rubber plantation for 30 years, in which a diverse range of native tropical rain forest tree and shrub species were planted for biodiversity conservation. They were expected to add structural complexity to a monoculture rubber plantation, but without the normal, continual fertilization and management (Feng, 2007;Catterall et al., 2008).",

Meanwhile, we also sampled soils both under the fallow land as the reference of initial type of restoration, and those under the primary rain forest as the reference of restoration target type (Garten et al., 2003). Restoration success was quantitatively assessed by comparing values of soil properties measured in the three restoration sites (replicated within each regime) with the values recorded from the two replicated reference sites in tropical rain forest and fallow land, after slash-and-burn cultivation, respectively (Paul et al., 2010).",

To satisfy the requirements of carbon trading systems, methodologies for estimating changes in C storage under different planting approaches and site conditions are needed. A 10-year field monitoring study of a moso bamboo reforestation area was carried out to research the effects of different planting approaches and site conditions on stand structure dynamics and aboveground C storage accumulation (AGCSA). The bamboo was transplanted in groups of 3 plants (3-PG) or as individual plants (IP). The site conditions were classified into three categories (poor, fair and excellent). The bamboo diameter at breast height (DBH) and height exhibited a slow-fast-slow growth rate trend under both planting approaches. The DBH and height peaked in the 9th year under the 3-PG approach, but maximum DBH and height values were not reached under the IP approach during the study period. The density (D) of new culms (NCs) peaked at five years after reforestation under both planting approaches, and the aboveground C storage (AGCS) of NCs peaked seven years after reforestation. Both planting approaches exhibited clear on-year and off-year plant growth characteristics. The different planting approaches and site conditions significantly influenced AGCSA. Growth models for DBH, height and AGCSA under the specific silvicultural approaches and site conditions were established on the basis of the identified correlations. Ten years after reforestation under the 3-PG approach, the AGCSA was only 3.71 Mg C ha -1 under poor site conditions, while under excellent site conditions, the AGCSA reached 14.71 Mg C ha -1 . An optimized management model that considers soil factors has great potential for improving C sequestration in moso bamboo forests.",

Currently, emission mitigation and carbon (C) sink enhancement have become two of the most prominent approaches to mitigating regional and global climate change (Baldocchi et al., 2018;James et al., 2018;Maxwell and Silva, 2020). Especially in developing countries, developing new C sinks through afforestation and reforestation has become the most effective, promising, and ecologically friendly ways of absorbing CO 2 and increasing terrestrial ecosystem C sinks (Huang et al., 2012(Huang et al., , 2020)). China has the highest afforestation rate in the world, which contributes significantly to the nation's C sequestration; for instance, the total afforestation area of the National Key Forestry Ecology Projects has accounted for 43.15% of China's forested area throughout the past five decades (State Forestry Administration, 1995-2017;Zhang et al., 2020). Bamboo stands have become an important forest type in South China, where they cover approximately 4.84-5.71 million ha; approximately half their total area is distributed in Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces (Chen et al., 2009;FAO, 2010;Yuen et al., 2017). Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), one of the most common bamboo species, is extensively used in afforestation and reforestation in subtropical China because of its fast height growth rate (approximately an average of 45 cm per day from April to May), high C sequestration rate and effective control of soil erosion in degraded mountain regions (Song et al., 2016a;Liu and Yen, 2020;Zhou et al., 2005Zhou et al., , 2009Zhou et al., , 2011)).",

Similarly, Yen and Lee (2011) found that the C sequestration rate of moso bamboo (8.13 Mg ha -1 year -1 ) was higher than that of Chinese fir (3.35 Mg ha -1 year -1 ) by investigating the aboveground C sequestration of moso bamboo and Chinese fir forests in the lower-elevation mountain regions of central Taiwan. Therefore, moso bamboo significantly influences several other tree species in atmospheric C sequestration. Afforestation and reforestation are known to be beneficial measures for reducing C emissions through C sequestration and thus provide \"natural solutions\" in climate mitigation policies (Azarnivand et al., 2020;Griscom et al., 2017;Jackson et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2019). Natural C sinks can offset other greenhouse gas emission (GHG) sources and deliver substantial C sequestration benefits, which causes net decrease in GHGs according to the definition of international agreements by the country (Grassi et al., 2017). It is necessary to develop methodologies to estimate variations in C stocks and how these pools will change because of diverse management practices (Mund et al., 2002); this is important to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and assess the roles of planting approaches, age, site quality, plantation densities, schedules of forest plating and size rank on the C stocks in forest biomass (Balboa-Murias et al., 2006).

(2019) found large differences in the average annual growth of biomass in mangrove plantations in Vietnam due to age and site conditions. Unlike other tree species, moso bamboo exhibits particular growth features and a monopodial rhizome system; therefore, nutrients and carbonates can be transported from mature to young culms (Xu et al., 2020a(Xu et al., , 2020b)). Different planting approaches have a significant effect on stand structure through rhizome expansion and thus form different systems following moso bamboo reforestation. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the effects of different planting approaches and site conditions on C dynamics following moso bamboo reforestation. C storage has been investigated in a few studies using the continuous monitoring of fixed sample plots or the effects of different planting approaches and site conditions on C budgets following moso bamboo reforestation. In this study, we monitored moso bamboo for 10 years after reforestation to investigate the effects of the planting approach and site conditions on stand structure and aboveground C dynamics.

We found that revegetation had a significant positive effect on fine particles, soil nutrients, soil bulk density (SBD), and soil fractal dimension (D) values. Soil D values under different types of vegetation range from 2.16 to 2.37. Soil nutrients and fractal dimension showed highly significant or stronger negative correlations with SBD and sand and highly significant or stronger positive correlations with clay and silt.

Generally speaking, desertification is driven by a combination of natural and human factors. The process of desertification involves biological and economic losses and is therefore inextricably linked to ecological security and regional development [2]. In past reports, it has been mentioned that the economic losses due to desertification in China are estimated at US$ 6.8 billion per year. The ability of the land to produce food and fodder, security of food, quantity and quality of fresh water, reduction in the resilience of the land, as well as maintenance costs of production and construction equipment, social costs, poverty, educational problems, and increased political instability, and even damage to human life and health, are some of the obvious effects of desertification [3]. These phenomena threaten the sustainable development goals of human social development in drylands. In addition, strong winds have blown sand particles from arid and semi-arid regions of China to Japan, Korea and even to the United States [4]. As a result, the United Nations Conference on Desertification was held in the 1980s. Since then, China has formally begun to adopt a multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach to combating desertification. Over the past three decades, researchers have made some positive progress in controlling desertification, with much of the work occurring in areas of fragile ecological conditions and high human activity [5]. Some scholars working on wind erosion have successively proposed ecological engineering interventions, such as artificial vegetation, to control these desertification hazards in northern China [6,7]. Moreover, there is a broad consensus worldwide that appropriate vegetation is the most sustainable and effective solution for restoring degraded land and combating desertification [8][9][10]. Vegetation can attenuate aeolian activity by increasing the aerodynamic roughness length of the surface and reducing the near-surface wind speed, capturing soil particles [11][12][13]. The deposition of soil particles supports soil development and vegetation growth [14,15].",
        "5490d955-9ad7-4618-b0bb-63fbefb92f63": "The deposition of soil particles supports soil development and vegetation growth [14,15]. Vegetation promotes the cycling of C and N and P in the soil system and improves soil quality through the secretions produced by the root system and the improvement of the soil microenvironment [16][17][18]. The Hobq Desert, the seventh largest desert in China, has seen population growth, lifestyle changes, and economic and social development over the past three decades that have accelerated desertification. A comprehensive assessment of the risk of wind erosion in the area using the IWEMS (Integrated Wind-Erosion Modeling System) and RWEQ (Revised Wind Erosion Equation) models has been carried out by several scholars and compared with observations from local government and hydrological stations. 31 t/m of saltation emission was discharged from the Hobq Desert between 2001 and 2010. Of this, up to 1.39 \u00d7 10 7 t of aoeolian sediment was blown from the Hobq Desert into Ten Tributaries in 2001 [19]. In 2002, China's Law on the Prevention and Control of Sand and Desertification was implemented with the aim of promoting sustainable development and preventing and combating desertification. The law is aimed at the whole of China and its implementation has boosted the enthusiasm of the whole society to combat drought and promote forestry in the desert [20]. Since then, the annual saltation deposition of sand into the Yellow River in China's Hobq Desert has been reduced to 2.04 \u00d7 10 6 t and the area of artificial vegetation has increased by 2506.86 km 2 by 2017 [19,21].

Populus alba var. pyramidalis, Caragana korshinskii, Hedysarum mongdicum, Hedysarum scoparium and Salix cheilophila are widely planted in the sandy areas of northern China [24,25] because of their fast growth rate, resistance to drought, adaptation to aeolian conditions [26], and improved soil properties [27,28]. The mix of plant species facilitates land restoration, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration, and is superior to single plant species in terms of human production and biodiversity restoration and conservation. Forrester (2019) has also confirmed this in a related report [29]. The construction of artificial vegetation has largely improved the aeolian environment and soil quality conditions in the Hobq Desert, but there is less information on the evaluation of vegetation restoration in the transition area between the desert and the Yellow River. The monsoon climate and human activities have driven the spread and shrinkage of the desert, making this transitional region more sensitive to environmental change [30,31]. The area transformed from barren areas such as hills to desert in the last 30 years is approximately 910.84 km 2 [21]. Desertification has been effectively controlled following the implementation of the drought afforestation project. Nevertheless, changes in soil properties after revegetation, especially under different mixed vegetation types, remain unclear. In addition, the soil fractal dimension serves as a complementary information representing the physical and chemical properties of the soil and changes in desertification. Previous studies have also demonstrated that soil fractal dimensions are indicative of desertification [32]. However, changes in soil fractal dimension under different types of mixed vegetation have been less studied. In this study, we investigated the vertical distribution of soil properties characteristics under four typical mixed vegetation types in the desert and the Yellow River coastal transition zone. The objectives of this study were (1) to study the differences and vertical distribution of soil properties under different mixed vegetation types, and to evaluate the most suitable types of vegetation restoration.",

Land use change and agricultural activities have caused degradation of soil quality and the building up of vegetation has contributed to the accumulation of soil organic matter, increased soil fertility, and improved soil structure [38,39]. Wind erosion causes loss of soil particles, which is another major cause of soil impoverishment. Sterk et al. (1996) also reports that the loss of soil C, N, and P elemental content due to wind erosion under strong storms is very significant by means of sample plot estimation [40]. In a similar report, Shao also demonstrated that soil nutrients and structure are influenced by vegetation type and human intervention under the same climatic and biological conditions [41]. Changes in vegetation type have altered the distribution pattern of soil nutrients, which in previous studies have contributed to soil nutrient content through root exudates and vegetation litters [42]. Differences in the quantity and quality of root exudates from different plants and the rate of decomposition of litters from different vegetation are important factors in the differences in soil nutrients [43,44]. However, the factors of drought and frequent aeolian activity in this study area have resulted in low litters, and the soil nutrient content is mainly secreted by the plant roots. The mixed vegetation type of YN has a higher content of all soil nutrients than the other mixed vegetation types and has a higher soil SOC and N content. The high growth rate and nitrogen fixation capacity of C. korshinskii [45,46] and the high vegetation cover of the area (Table 1) are important factors in protecting the soil from erosion and enrichment of soil SOC and N content. The distribution of soil nutrient content under different mixed vegetation types shows 0-10 cm soil layer > 10-20 cm soil layer > 20-30 cm soil layer, reflecting the superficial effect of soil nutrient content distribution. Zhang et al. (2019) mentions that the nutrient content of the surface layer of the soil is higher than that of the deeper layers, a phenomenon that may be related to the higher biological activity and root penetration of the surface layer in his report [47].",
        "9959a838-336f-4482-943b-c4f2d65ebdd9": "In addition, the construction of the vegetation increases the aerodynamic roughness of the surface, which helps to protect the soil fine particle content, and also traps soil particles and provides a stable microclimate. Soil particles are finer under different vegetation types than in bare sandy areas, with clay, silt, and very fine sand content increasing to 0.48-1.40%, 1.47-15.73%, and 0.94-11.82% respectively. The accumulation of clay and silt content contributed to the increase in soil nutrient content [48], which resulted in clay, silt, and soil nutrient content showing a highly significant (p < 0.01) or stronger significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) (Figure 5). In addition, soil bulk density and soil moisture content can also reflect soil texture, as there is an interdependence between the physical and chemical properties of the soil [49,50]. The distribution of the physical properties of the soil of the different mixed vegetation types is therefore broadly similar to the distribution pattern of soil nutrients. Sand and soil bulk density showed either a highly significant (p < 0.01) or a stronger significant negative (p < 0.001) correlation with soil nutrient content. The fractal dimension of a soil reflects the distribution of soil particles or soil properties, and it is often used to assess changes in the soil environment. Wind-induced loss of soil fine fractions causes damage to soil structure, loss of nutrients in aeolian environment. After vegetation reconstruction, the content of clay and silt increased, while the content of sand decreased (Appendix A, Table A1). D value and clay, silt content showed a stronger significant positive correlation. There is a stronger negative correlation between D value and sand content [51]. Similar findings were reported by Feng et al. (2019): an increase in the clay and silt content and a decrease in the sand content indicated a richer soil nutrient content. The increase in clay and silt content and the decrease in sand content indicated an increase in D values [52].",

This shows that the distribution pattern of soil D values is generally consistent with the distribution pattern of soil nutrients and physical structure. Feng also provides an explanation for the increase in soil D values with increasing soil depth. The vertical variability of the soil environment is characterized by complex factors such as soil evolution, plant cover, decomposition of litters, and wind erosion and deposition [52]. In addition, we used path analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of soil physical and chemical characteristics on D values. AN and clay content have different direct and indirect effects on D value. Soil nutrients and clay interact with each other, with a highly significant or stronger significant correlation. The direct path coefficients for clay and AN on soil D values were 0.92 and 0.16, indicating that clay had a greater effect on D values than AN (Table 6). The indirect path coefficient indicates that a change in one indicator of the independent variable causes a change in another indicator of the independent variable, which ultimately leads to a change in the dependent variable. AN and clay have different indirect effects on soil D values. As mentioned above, the accumulation of fine soil particles and soil nutrients indicates an increase in D values. In addition, the promotion of soil nutrient accumulation by fine soil particles can also increase D values. According to our research, the planting of vegetation adapted to arid, aeolian environment with a rapid rate of nitrogen fixation is conducive to the reversal of desertification. The scientific conservation and management of artificial vegetation in desert ecosystems and the ongoing vegetation construction projects are equally important.",

The Tibetan Plateau, located in southwestern China, is one of the world's most sensitive areas to global warming and human activities, as the mean elevation is over 4000 m above sea level (Wang et al. 2016). Aeolian desertification in the Tibetan Plateau is primarily controlled by climatic conditions and landforms, which act differently on the different eco-regions of the plateau (Zhang et al. 2018).

Natural restoration is an ecosystem management approach to reduce the adverse effects of unreasonable human activities, such as overgrazing, extensive land reclamation, and excessive firewood collection (Shen et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2019).

Our initial hypotheses were as follows: (1) Natural and artificial restoration lead to significant changes in soil properties, especially in the soil particle size and soil organic matter (SOM), and (2) unlike other ecologically fragile areas, there are no significant differences in the soil properties between 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm, due to strong sand movement in the alpine valley. were frequent and strong in the alpine valley of the river basin. The annual average wind speed was about 3 m/s, and the monthly maximum wind velocity was 17 m/s in the area. The soil was sandy with gravel, accumulated by blowing winds or wind erosion, and characterized by short formation time, coarse texture, and low water retention and fertilizer conservation (Li et al. 2013). To prevent and control sandstorms, the local government has implemented a series of ecological protection and restoration projects, including afforestation, revegetation of the sandy land, and grassland restoration (Li et al. 2016a). A series of continuous investments in vegetation recovery has improved regional ecosystem services and mitigated the damage of sandstorms. The species for revegetation included Salix alba L., Artemisia wellbyi, Sophora moorcroftiana, Stipa bungeana Trin., Populus alba var. pyramidalis, Oxytropis sericopetala, A. younghusbandii, Hedysarum scoparium, Caragana microphylla Lam., and Orinus thoroldii (Li et al. 2019a).",

To enhance the accuracy of such estimations, the development of locally not pantropically-derived reliable allometric models is advised whenever possible, especially for dominant and widely distributed tree species, such as in the Castanopsis carlesii H. (C. carlesii) forests in subtropical China. Here, C. carlesii allometric equations were developed and applied to examine for three subtropical forests: a natural primary forest, an artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest and a C. carlesii plantation. To develop these allometric equations, destructive measurements of architecture and biomass of above-and below-ground components were undertaken for 33 sample trees from 10 dominant species, with stem diameters (at 1.30 m, or above buttresses) ranging from 4 to 67 cm. The mixed-species regressions with only the diameter at breast height as a predictor gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for biomass estimation of foliage, branch and coarse roots; the inclusion of tree height gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for estimation of stem",

The forest sink is large, based on recent studies, but it varies with location (Pan et al. 2011;Chave et al. 2015). A recent study showed that the average net ecosystem productivity of East Asian subtropical forest is about 362 g C m -2 year -1 , higher than Asian tropical and temperate forest, and even higher than forests at same latitudes in North America, Europe, and Africa (Yu et al. 2014). However, the estimation of above-and below-ground biomass in subtropical forests lacks accuracy because of the high species diversity in these forests and the structural complexity characterizing evergreen broadleaved forests. China has the largest expanse of subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest in the world, occupying about one-fourth of the country's total forest area and covering 2.5 9 10 6 km 2 between 23\u00b0N and 34\u00b0N and 102\u00b031 0 E and 122\u00b0E (Wu 1980). Owing to human activities, deforestation, and forest regeneration, subtropical forests have been severely fragmented, and large areas of evergreen broadleaved forest have changed to plantation or farmland over the last century (Chen et al. 2013). Hence, there is a pressing need to accurately quantify and monitor carbon dynamics due to forest regeneration in subtropical regions. The method based on tree allometric equations coupled with forest inventories has been widely used for measuring the biomass of forests (Chaturvedi et al. 2011;Chaturvedi andRaghubanshi 2013, 2015a;Yuen et al. 2016). Previously, the common pantropical equations that were applied to estimate the biomass of evergreen broadleaved forests in China were generally derived from tropical or even temperate forests. However, many studies have since showed that biomass estimates using these pantropical equations were imprecise (Fang et al. 1998;Di et al. 2012).",
        "c7fadace-6dfb-44d3-9161-fc94cd27accb": "1998;Di et al. 2012). The accuracy of biomass estimation is influenced by the selection of allometric equations. Ideally, species-specific allometric equations would provide accurate above-ground biomass estimation for forests with their complicated structure and many tree species (Hashimoto et al. 2004;Sawadogo et al. 2010;Chaturvedi and Raghubanshi 2015b;Ding et al. 2016). However, it is time-consuming and strenuous to empirically develop all of the species-specific regression models through destructive harvests. As a result, the mixed-species regression model for pooling species or individual equations for only the dominant species are generally applied to estimate community-level tree biomass (Kiyono et al. 2007;Chaturvedi et al. 2012). However, the development of allometric equations must incorporate enough species to provide accurate biomass estimates in the complex natural forest ecosystem because the allometric equations can be influenced by ecological interactions and management practices (Ding et al. 2016). Otherwise, for example, one may underestimate the true biomass when employing the allometric equations to estimate the biomass of old-growth forest. Most biomass studies still only focus on the above-ground component (Avalos and Sylvester 2010;Chaturvedi et al. 2010;Chave et al. 2015), while other tree components such as below-ground biomass, coarse root, and litter have rarely been studied (Repola 2009;Fonseca et al. 2012). Tree roots, in particular, also contribute considerably to total biomass and forest carbon storage (Norby and Jackson 2000). Thus, one allometric relationship, based on stem diameter, is recommended for robustly estimating root biomass of trees. The tree species Castanopsis carlesii H. is widespread and dominates the subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest in subtropical China.",
        "ef86c054-56b3-41a5-b14e-8d4d22387dfa": "These C. carlesii forests support high levels of biomass pools in forest ecosystems, and so this species plays an important role in their hydrology, erosion, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and biological diversity (Lugo et al. 2004;Guo et al. 2010b;Korfel et al. 2010). To date, tree species in China for which published allometric equations are available include: Cryptocarya concinna (Peng and Zhang 1994), Castanopsis chinensis and Crytocarya chinensis (Luo et al. 2014), Erythrophleum ferdii (Yi et al. 2000), Schima superba (Yang et al. 2010a), Castanopsis eyrei (Lin et al. 2012), Cyclobalanopsis chungii (Huang 2006), and Cyclobalanopsis glauca (Chen and Shen 1993). However, surprisingly little research has been developed on the allometric equation for C. carlesii. The common pantropical equations are insufficient for estimating the biomass of C. carlesii forests. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new best-fitting C. carlesii model of allometric equations by sampling larger sampling trees and more species in order to provide more precise information on the biomass estimation of C. carlesii forests. In Fujian Province, China, the largest areas of C. carlesii evergreen broadleaved forests have been clear-felled to satisfy demand for wood or forest products (Guo et al. 2010a). Artificial afforestation and artificially assisted natural regeneration are two common ways for the restoration and rehabilitation of clear-felled forests (Huang and Li 1998). Artificial afforestation involves establishing forest plantations by slashing and burning and then planting seedlings. Artificially assisting natural regeneration occurred from the secondary forest after heavy selective logging and subsequent practices to assist forest recovery, followed by natural regeneration.",
        "d7cbc59a-8ea4-41da-ab63-d60a6ad49358": "Several studies, however, have shown that artificial afforestation would lead to serious land degradation, a decrease in biodiversity, and lowered forest productivity (Lyu et al. 2016). By contrast, approaches for artificially assisted natural regeneration have been widely used as part of another important practice; they are an option for effective forest management owing to their enhanced biodiversity conservation when compared with that of plantations (Huang and Li 1998;Lindenmayer et al. 2000;Lyu et al. 2016). However, which management practices are most effective and offer the most potential for biomass carbon sequestration and productivity is still unclear (Chaturvedi and Raghubanshi 2015a, b). There is thus a need to better estimate above-ground biomass to accurately estimate carbon accumulation in subtropical forests. The objectives of this work were: (1) to develop allometric equations for estimating the above-and below-ground biomass of a natural primary forest, an artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest, and C. carlesii plantation in subtropical China; (2) to examine the effectiveness of these allometric equations when applied to these three subtropical forests; and (3) to assess the regeneration pattern in the artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest, and C. carlesii plantation. Considering the different biodiversity among the three forest types, we hypothesized that the best-fitting allometric equations are forest type dependent, thus distingushing allometric equations is needed for estimating biomass of different forests.",

Although this study could not incorporate enough species and sample very large trees because of the impractical logistics involved in such field work, the regression models for mixed-species and dominant-species proved to be more variable when compared with previous allometric equations for biomass estimates of local natural C. carlesii forest (Yang et al. 2010a;Chave et al. 2015). Nonetheless, our tree-harvested data presented a goodness-of-fit and correspondence when overlaid upon the trend for trees in the tropics (Fig. 2), indicating that our data is sufficient to make allometric models for biomass estimation of subtropical forests. In addition, the basal area statistics from the artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest and the C. carlesii plantation showed that the dominant species C. carlesii, S. superba, and C. fissa occupied a very high ratio in the whole stand. Therefore, the biomass estimates of artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest and C. carlesii plantation were satisfactory. This is further supported by how well our models were able to predict the results of other studies (Fig. 3). However, the biomass estimation of natural primary forest might be an underestimation because our allometric model relied upon a smaller sample of trees. Further empirical research should use increased sample sizes and species to improve the accuracy of such predictions. Previous studies have used various predictors such as tree diameter, height, crown area, form, and other variables to estimate the biomass of component (Ter-Mikaelian and Korzukhin 1997; Suchomel et al. 2012;Dong et al. 2015). However, stem diameter and height remain the most common variables for developing tree biomass allometry because crown area and other crown variables are much harder to quantify in subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests.",
        "fafef1f4-454e-4e3d-87ce-25c5802aad99": "In the present study, DBH was also the best predictor for estimating the biomass of foliage, branch, and coarse root components. Adding measures of tree height may not explain significantly more of the variance in biomass estimates. Taking the simplicity of regressions models into consideration, the allometric equations were best for biomass estimation of foliage, branch and coarse root with DBH only included. However, it was still difficult to precisely predict branch and foliage biomass with DBH alone. Makungwa et al. (2013) suggested that branch and foliage biomass were controlled by weather changes, insect herbivores, and inter-specific competition, to name a few key Relative error (estimated minus observed TB, divided by observed TB, in %) calculated based on the mixedspecies model 3 (c) and dominant-species model 4 (d); the data points below the dashed line, illustrating a slight negative bias at small TB values and vice versa. Non-parametric regression a Gaussian kernel was used for trend curve ecological interactions. Some authors have suggested that inputting the variable crown size or foliage area ought to improve the accuracy of estimates of branch and foliage biomass (Xu and Harrington 1998;Porte \u00b4et al. 2000). For the stem biomass estimation, the mixed- species allometric model with just the two variables of DBH and height was more precise compared to the model using a function of DBH alone. Similar findings have been reported for many other studies (Ruiz-Peinado et al. 2012;Chan et al. 2013). Competitive environment factors, such as forest type, stand age, tree density, etc., must be indirectly considered when selecting appropriate allometric models for biomass estimation. Therefore, when employing equations for estimating the forest biomass at different sites, adding the variable tree height can make the model more general in its scope and application (Ketterings et al. 2001). According to Chave et al. (2005), wood density acts as an important predictive variable in mixed-species regression models for the estimation of above-ground biomass in tropical forests.",
        "c62f5450-cc31-4535-b411-ff192dcc5e6c": "However, in this study, the three variables of DBH, height, and wood density could not provide an improved goodness-of-fit for each biomass component investigated. This result is not consistent with other studies (e.g., Martinez-Yrizar et al. 1992). The first plausible explanation for this discrepancy is simply that the mixed-species regression models in other studies were derived from different sites and tree species of tropical forests (Muller-Landau 2004). Significant differences in wood density are often found within sites of tropical trees, but the site-specific wood density values obtained from a few individuals were not significantly different among the three forests in our study. A second explanation could be that fewer trees were selected and sampled for establishing the allometric equations than in other tropical forest studies. Measurement uncertainty may result from instrument error, recording error, or arise from the nature of the object being measured (Chave et al. 2004). Therefore, when choosing an allometric equation for biomass estimation, the equation should be used that best estimates the accurate value and reduces the chances of error that may be compounded. The height of trees are notoriously tedious to measure accurately in the complex structure and topography of most forests. The standard value of wood density obtained from sampling a few trees introduces error into the models fitted. Therefore, employing DBH as the single predictor variable in biomass estimation of foliage, branch, and coarse root may be more practical and perhaps equally accurate, but the stem biomass estimation with two parameters (DBH and height) is clearly preferable. By testing our models with the published harvested trees data, we confirmed that our models could do well at estimating total biomass (Fig. 3).",

The following indicators of restoration success were evaluated: canopy cover; basal area; above-ground biomass; total richness; richness and density of regenerating trees. Passive restoration strategy has been found to be successful in the study area as the observed values for the indicators (except basal area and biomass) were above reference values specified for a 12-year-old active restoration.

According to the last Global Forest Resources Assessment, Brazil has about 497 million hectares of forest cover, being among the five countries with the largest forest area in the world (FAO 2020). However, human occupation has been causing a progressive increase in the destruction of natural resources, and forests have been replaced to allow other land uses (Rech et al. 2015). Among the forest typologies most impacted by anthropogenic activities are the riparian forests. This type of forest needs special attention, as it has direct influence on physicochemical and biological parameters of water bodies (Tambosi et al. 2015). Riparian forests are fundamental components of aquatic ecosystems, which are responsible for providing a broad set of ecosystem services (Tundisi and Tundisi 2010). In face of this scenario of progressive environmental damage, human intervention in degraded areas is mandatory as a way to help reverse environmental degradation processes (Engel and Parrotta 2008). Such intervention can be done through forest restoration, a practice that has gained importance in Brazil due to the increasing legal requirements for environmental regularization of productive activities (Brancalion et al. 2012). Passive restoration (based on spontaneous or unassisted natural vegetation regeneration) may be a simple economically and ecologically advantageous restoration strategy (Holl and Aide 2011;M\u00e9ndez-Tor\u00edbio et al. 2017;Caughlin et al. 2019). Natural regeneration plays an important role in reducing the costs of restoration, which makes it relevant for developing countries that need to recover large territorial extensions (Rezende et al. 2015;M\u00e9ndez-Tor\u00edbio et al. 2017). Research in the field of restoration projects monitoring can contribute to the improvement of ecological restoration techniques and, when addressed to passive restoration, assist in understanding secondary succession processes and in assessing the restoration potential of natural regeneration (Chetan et al. 2019;Viapiana et al. 2019).",

All restoration plans on a national scale in Latin America take the view that the most reliable way to achieve restoration is to facilitate or assist natural regeneration, however, only Brazilian restoration plans propose indicators to comprehensively monitor the recovery of the degraded ecosystem (M\u00e9ndez-Tor\u00edbio et al. 2017). Pioneering instruments for monitoring restoration developed in Brazil help achieve the desired results in restoration programmes. Such instruments are based on the principles of resilience and self-sustainability, so that they can serve as support for the creation of similar monitoring mechanisms in other countries (Chaves et al. 2015). On the other hand, the current monitoring protocols have been developed for active restoration projects (based on seedling planting) and little is known about their applicability in assessing vegetation resulting from passive restoration, an important knowledge gap for the restoration of tropical and subtropical forests. The present study was developed in an area of subtropical riparian forest, which was used as pasture until 2005, when, after the installation of fences, was abandoned to allow forest recovery using the passive restoration strategy. Since then, no evaluation has been made to assess the response of the area being restored to the applied technique. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the passive restoration of the study area by comparing observed values for restoration indicators with reference values adapted from two monitoring protocols found in the literature. These protocols were developed for the evaluation of active restoration projects with seedling planting, but we suggest that they could be used for the evaluation of passive restoration projects too, due to the lack of protocols specific for this purpose. In this context three questions arose: Can the reference values established for active restoration be achieved through unassisted natural regeneration? If so, are these values for passive restoration achieved at the same speed as for active restoration? What adjustments could be proposed for the protocols for monitoring active restoration projects to facilitate their application in the evaluation of passive restoration?",

During the last 50 years, land uses have greatly changed in the mountainous areas in southwestern China as the result of deforestation and cultivation. A study was initiated in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan province to elucidate the complex relationships in a humid mountainous region. Soil properties under six typical land use types (natural forest, grassland, shrub, secondary forest, cultivated land and reforested land) were compared. Signi\u00aecant differences between land uses were found for soil bulk density (BD), total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). Cultivated land had the lowest levels for most soil properties compared to other land uses and shrubland had a higher SOC, TN and available nitrogen (AN) than other land uses. Soils under grassland and shrub contained the greatest carbon mass (TC). Further studies on reforested land indicated that soil properties could be changed by length of reforestation. The SOC and TN in particular showed a linear relationship with years since reforestation. The results suggested that in an area of China where the climate favours secondary succession, `leave nature as it is' is a better choice than the policy `change farmland to forest land', especially for the mountainous regions where there is lack of labour and \u00aenancial support.",

From 2001 to the end of 2010, the forest areas increased more than 2.3 million ha, and total carbon storage in forest ecosystems was 173.02 Tg C, of which 82.80 percent was contained in soil in the top 0-100 cm layer. Younger forests have a large potential for enhancing carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems than older ones. Regarding future afforestation efforts, it will be more effective to increase forest area and vegetation carbon density through selection of appropriate tree species and stand structure according to local climate and soil conditions, and application of proper forest management including land-shaping, artificial tending and fencing plantations. It would be also important to protect the organic carbon in surface soils during forest management.",

Among all vegetation types, forests play an important role in regional and global carbon cycles because they store large quantities of carbon in vegetation and soils; they become atmospheric carbon sources following human or natural disturbance, and become carbon sinks during re-growth after disturbance [2]. Forestry projects improve tree coverage on lands that have not supported forest growth in historical time (afforestation), through direct seeding and planting, and through plantation forestry [3]. Enhancing carbon sequestration by increasing the plantation area is regarded as a potential measure to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 concentration rise and prevent global warming [4]. The effects of afforestation on total ecosystem carbon storages have been widely studied in recent years [5][6][7][8][9][10][11], and consequently, global, national, and regional carbon densities databases in various above-and belowground forest pools [12][13][14] in different forest types [15], land uses [16][17], and forest areas [18][19][20] have been established. National Forest Resource Inventory (NFRI) database (2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) from the Forestry Ministry of P. R. China shows that 80 percent of plantations in China are young, middle, and near-mature forests [14,20]. To understand the effects of afforestation projects especially at early implementation stage on carbon dynamics, estimation of carbon storages in young plantation ecosystems is urgently needed. In many areas of North China, the intensified spring wind possibly due to climate changes, and the inappropriate human activities including relentless land cultivation, deforestation, and overgrazing, have led to a continued loss of vegetation cover and topsoil [21][22]. Facing such serious ecological problems, the Chinese government has invested huge amounts of money into Key Forestry Programs including Grain for Green Project, Three-North Shelter Forest System Project, and Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project (BTSSCP) [23].",

Plantations can improve vegetation cover and carbon sequestration, and weaken the transport of wind-born dust and sand to other countries by controlling soil erosion [24][25]. In 2000, a national ecological construction program, the BTSSCP, was launched to improve the ecological environment in Beijing, Tianjin, and the surrounding areas and thereby to prevent the hazards of sand storms by forest recovery and protection [26]. Estimating carbon storages in plantation ecosystems in sand source areas plays an important role in objectively evaluating the ecoenvironmental effects of treatment projects and affirms the contribution of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems to the global carbon cycle. In this study, vegetation survey database, allometric equations, statistical database of annual planting species in sand source areas from 2001-2010, and 2004-2008 NFRI were used to determine (1) carbon storages and carbon densities and (2) the size and spatial distribution of carbon sinks over the past decade in plantation ecosystems in sand source areas of north Beijing.",

Plantation ecosystems in sand source areas play an important role in the carbon cycle and carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in China. The increased forest area and the plantation growth suggested that successful afforestation implementation and consecutive management programs over the past decade allow plantations to contribute greatly to carbon sequestration [40]. Results from China and other countries indicated that plantations made major contributions to the formation of state-level carbon sink [39][40][41]. China's plantation area is 62 million ha according to 2004-2008 NFRI, and forest ecosystems have turned into carbon sinks because of the state-level afforestation and reforestation activities during the past few years [39]. Plantations in China and Japan made major contributions to state-level carbon sink [41][42]. The total forest biomass carbon stocks in Korea increasing from 20.57 Tg in 1954 to 239.85 Tg in 2007 were mainly attributed to the successfully implemented afforestation and subsequent management practices [40]. Meanwhile, some phenomena were also found in the course of project implementation and management in this research. For example, in our study areas, economic forests developed higher levels of vegetation cover than other afforestation species over the past decade. The undergrowth herbaceous vegetations were directly removed to accelerate tree growth, which is the initiative for forest restoration [32]. Species diversity which plays a vital role in enhancing carbon storage and overall productivity of plantations [43] was seriously diminished because of management activities and artificial tending. Extensive afforestation efforts in arid and semiarid regions have caused environmental deterioration, with deteriorating ecosystems and more frequent wind erosion [44]. If species selection or early land-shaping and artificial tending is inappropriate, even traditional forms of afforestation can be risky, and plantations may fail [45][46].",
        "415371a4-5bfc-4229-aed5-e0a60d32df7b": "Therefore, preserving or restoring the existing ecosystems by conserving and actively managing the large areas of existing secondary forests may be a primary goal of carbon sequestration efforts [46][47] through natural processes rather than afforestation [48]. However, the natural recovering ability of severely degraded forests cannot be assured, and recovery becomes more difficult when an ecosystem has crossed an ecological threshold to a new steady state [49]. Moreover, various afforestation methodologies are available for currently deforested areas [46]. Future afforestation designs should target more at selection of suitable tree species, management of age structures, and implementation of good silvicultural practices for improving biodiversity, ecological functioning, and human livelihoods [50][51]. Forest carbon storage in a specific region is affected by many factors such as climate, solar radiation, forest area, forest ages, species composition, land-use history, disturbance, and field and soil characteristics [51][52]. This study shows that coniferous forests have statistically higher total carbon density than other forest types. Among all coniferous forests, L. gmelini forest contains the highest average carbon because of the large carbon quantity stored in trees, which is consistent with other studies [53][54], so it may be concluded that coniferous forests are the plant species more suitable for the local environment. Economic forests such as A. sibirica contain a lower understory carbon because the undergrowth herbaceous vegetation (i.e. grasses, forbs, and herbs) was manually removed to promote tree growth by alleviating competition for nutrient and moisture. Among broadleaved forests, the average carbon density of U. pumila is lower because the slow-growing younger plantations support lower vegetation biomass. Among shrubs, H. rhamnoides contains higher carbon because its rapid root propagation supports higher vegetation densities. The differences in forest area, forest species, and forest structures led to different ecosystem carbon sequestrations [32], [51]. Increasing forest area and vegetation carbon density through application of different tree species and age structures can be a practical and effective strategy to improve vegetation carbon sequestration [51], [55].",

[56] and Huang [57] also found that carbon density in the forest ecosystem was spatially differentiated with the zonalities of longitude, latitude and altitude, probably because of the differences in regional climates and soil conditions. The results also suggested an important direction for design of reforestation programs and for enhancement of vegetation carbon sequestration potentials in sand source areas of north Beijing [51]: target more at the selection of suitable tree species according to local climate and soil conditions. The average carbon density in plantation ecosystems is 93.12 Mg ha 21 , and carbon storage in forest vegetation is 25.06 Mg ha 21 , which are generally lower compared with other studies in China [58][59][60][61]. For instance, the average carbon density in forest vegetation in China was determined to be 42-50 Mg ha 21 (15-32 Mg ha 21 in planted forests) [58], 35-39 Mg ha 21 [61], or 6.47-118.14 Mg ha 21 [60]. The main cause for the differences might be that the plantations in sand source areas of north Beijing are younger. It also suggests that the forests there have large potential for carbon sequestration. In this study, forest carbon storage includes the carbon stored in trees, understory, forest floor, and top soils (i.e. 0-100 cm).",
        "86071f05-66c9-4b82-95c7-0860be8eda09": "0-100 cm). Trees including roots contained 8.42 Mg ha 21 of carbon, while understory, litter layer, and the 0-100 cm topsoil contained 5.55, 2.05, and 77.10 Mg ha 21 , respectively, which are generally lower than that of other forested areas in China. For instance, the average carbon densities of vegetation, litter, and soil in Chinese forest ecosystems were estimated to be 57.07, 8.21, and 193.55 Mg ha 21 , respectively [56]. Lower carbon accumulation in the studied forest and soil might result from the singleness of afforestation species, younger forest age, lower biomass, poorer forest structure and function, and shorter restoration time [32], [62]. Land management practices, including species selection, land-shaping patterns, and artificial tending patterns should be adjusted in design of afforestation programs to increase vegetation carbon storage. Soil carbon storage distributed in the top 0-40 cm layer accounts for 50.46 percent of the total carbon storage within the 0-100 cm of soil, which is consistent with other studies [32], [57], [63]. Reportedly, more than 60 percent [32], or 35-80 percent of carbon in the depth of 0-100 cm was stored in the top 0-40 cm in tropical and subtropical soils [64]. Therefore, protection of organic carbon in the surface soils of planted forests is important for improving carbon sequestration [32].",

It grows vigorously and has spread over much of the southern and southeastern coast, from Zhejiang to Guangxi, over a range of more than 10\u00b0of latitude. To date, little is known about its interactions with native species in the coastal zone.We used a field experiment to study how the understorey species diversity and soil conditions in monoculture stands of C. equisetifolia were influenced by different native plant species. We also examined the effects of interplanting native species on plant numbers, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground biomass accumulation. We planted three native species (Hibiscus tiliaceus, Melia azedarach and Calophyllum inophyllum) at two initial densities in stands of C. equisetifolia.Over a period of ten years, the density and aboveground biomass were relatively low in plots planted with three native species compared to plots that were not planted. In contrast, understory diversity and soil conditions were relatively high where native species were added. Moreover, the number of dead tree, aboveground biomass increment, and diameter growth had significant difference among different native tree species because of their different natural characteristics.The fast-growing pioneer species, M. azedarach, had a positive effect on LAI, regeneration, shrub diversity and grass coverage than the other two native species, and M. azedarach was most effective in plots that were initially planted with higher densities. The pioneer plant H. tiliaceus had more individuals and greater aboveground biomass than others native species. The later-succession species C. inophyllum had the smallest effect on the development of understory vegetation and soil conditions over 10-yrs among three native plants.",

        "aa670cef-7c80-4f07-a171-d8bbfff05eec": "Native species are those that have evolved over geological time in response to physical and biotic processes that are characteristic of a particular region; these characteristics include the climate, soil, timing of rainfall, drought, and interactions with other species in the local community (Richards et al., 1998;Palmer et al., 2003;Callaway, 2007). These interactions shape the structure and function of communities and ecosystems (Wootton and Emmerson, 2005), affecting population growth and fecundity, abundance, geographical range, soil nutrient supply, community diversity and stability (Paige and Whitham, 1987;Maron, 1998;Novak and Wootton, 2010). Facilitation has long been recognised as a regulator of community organisation and as one of the most important positive community interactions (Bertness and Callaway, 1994;He et al., 2012). Facilitation also has applications to community restoration in harsh ecosystems (Brady et al., 2002). Because facilitation by exotic species is still debated (Simberloff and Von Holle, 1999;Rodriguez, 2006), the majority of experimental and theoretical research on facilitation focuses on native species, even if the interactions are between native and exotic species (Losos et al., 1993;Bezemer et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2012). Exotic plants can change the composition and function of microbial communities, alter soil food web structures and influence nutrient cycling (Scharfy et al., 2010). These effects may arise from differences between native and exotic species in functional traits and allow exotic species to colonise and flourish in a habitat. Communities of invasive may be helpful in vegetation restoration, especially when the original community has been destroyed, but they are not usually the desired vegetation for the long term. To change the conditions of exotic-dominated communities, one promising approach is to find appropriate native species (or species groups) and use facilitation to adjust the structure and function of the current community.",
        "e59fac48-e60f-4da2-b11e-84179448e769": "Casuarina equisetifolia, native to the southern and eastern coasts of Australia, was introduced to Hainan Island China to reduce coastal erosion in the 1950s, and immediately became the dominant species due to its pioneer characteristics, including fast growth, adaptability to barren soils, and ability to resist wind (Hammerton, 2001). C. equisetifolia has special canopy characters such as whorls of tiny scales, fine cladodes and tower-shaped morphological structure. These phenotypic traits increase wind resistance and allow better growth in hostile coastal environments (Chen et al., 2005). However, due to its high tannin content, the branches and leaves of C. equisetifolia decompose slowly, which decreases the speed of nutrient return and influences the growth of forest. The litter beneath C. equisetifolia (made up of fallen cladodes) can build up to form thick continuous deposits, which simply by their presence smother other species and prevent establishment (Hammerton, 2001;Batish et al., 2001). In addition, machine-cultivated afforestation with monocultures of C. equisetifolia was once the sole management approach for protecting coastal forests and this approach destroyed the composition and structure of the original community along with the soil seed bank, causing native species to disappear from reforested lands. As a result, forest productivity declined and forest succession in the tropical coastal zone was arrested by the lack of native species (Wheeler et al., 2011). To change above conditions, three native tree species (see Table 1 -Hibiscus tiliaceus, Melia azedarach and Calophyllum inophyllum) that once thrived in the coastal forest were interplanted with one-year-old C. equisetifolia in the monoculture. Comparing the response by such native species to their shared neighbours can reduce the harmful effects of C. equisetifolia and help develop management strategies for native species.",

Our general objective is to understand whether an exotic forest community can be changed by other native species. The specific objectives of this study were to determine: (1) how the understorey species diversity and soil conditions in monoculture stands of C. equisetifolia were influenced by different native species; (2) how the effects of different mixed afforestation on dynamics of planted species (number, LAI and biomass accumulation) as the forest developed.",
        "3f283483-f4a9-41e3-abae-135997e30a2b": "Species always perform better in their native communities, even if some species are absent. Gleason (1917) argued that the functional characteristics of species within communities, rather than diversity per se, are the most important drivers of plant community composition and the greatest influence on community assemblage and development. Foresters seldom use native species to change the structure and condition of communities of invasives, leaving them dominant and allowing them to hinder alternative succession processes. Our study shows that the facilitation between native-and exotic-species can improve such communities over a ten year time frame. Moreover, we posit that in addition to direct interactions between planted species, the influences of native species in facilitating diversity, richness and better soil conditions can contribute to habitat restoration. Our results thus support the hypothesis that the initial assemblage of a plant community is crucial in determining the composition of a plant community in the longer term (Bezemer et al., 2006), even if that assemblage is dominated by an exotic species. Species respond differently to environmental stress, and their strategies are changed by interspecific interactions in multispecies assemblages. Compared with C. inophyllum and H. tiliaceus, M. azedarach seedlings do very poorly in the open, but their recruitment improves under C. equisetifolia, which provides shelter against a harsh maritime environment. Our study shows that the  number of alive individuals in each treatment has positive correlation with the initial density of C. equisetifolia during 10-yr period. For the same native tree species, the number of dead trees in treatments with more C. equisetifolia individuals (proportion II) were higher than the other (proportion I). While, the death of exotic trees had little relationship with different planting treatments. H. tiliaceus can take full advantage of the protective effect from C. equisetifolia, and had higher survivorship than the other two species during the 10-yr period. The crown canopy always undergoes more stress in coastal environments, and special canopy characters allow C. equisetifolia to maintain a stable canopy condition and higher LAI even in harsh surroundings.",
        "dac36674-749c-4dd0-a2f0-4a55e7d8e08e": "As a fast-growing species, M. azedarach raises the stand LAI more than other two native species. The effects on LAI by M. azedarach are negligible. There was a big drop of LAI in 2008 in all plots (Fig. 2B), this might be caused by the fierce typhoon activity in the survey interval (between 2006 and 2008). Beyond any maximum-yield density, interactions occur as component species strive to capture resources from a shared location (Jose et al., 2006). Relative to C. inophyllum and H. tiliaceus, M. azedarach has more capacity to accumulate biomass because it grows quickly, although this does not improve the biomass accumulation in the mixed forest because of the resource competition from C. equisetifolia. Although the effect of H. tiliaceus on biomass accumulation is small, the resource utilisation between H. tiliaceus and C. equisetifolia is less competitive, raising their total aboveground biomass accumulation when planted together (Tables 2 and3). The mean DBH growth of native tree species were mainly depend on their characteristic. For those exotic trees, the mean DBH growth were not only depend on the type of native species but on initial mixed proportion (Table 3). In understory, shrubs play an important role in ecosystems because they are resistant to climate conditions, especially to drought or a saline environment (Aich, 1991). Natural regeneration also plays a key role on vegetation restoration and development. In our experiment, native species planted at different densities with C. equisetifolia influenced the understory characteristics such as diversity and grass abundance. All of the understory layers (regeneration, shrub, and grass) were improved in the M. azedarach treatments (I and II), followed by H. tiliaceus (I and II). Although C. inophyllum treatments (I and II) had less effect than the other two native species, it still provided a marginal improvement over the monoculture of C. equisetifolia.",
        "80015aac-0d99-485b-8aac-36bf88f75c7d": "For each native species, understory vegetation improved more under level I than II. However, we provide no direct evidence to explain the role of native species on recruitment, regeneration and shrub development. Nevertheless, the development of different species assemblages can profoundly affect understory vegetation dynamics and produce results such as those of Bezemer et al. (2006). Many earlier studies have been performed on short time scales and used artificial management (such as weeding) (Van Ruijven et al., 2003;Meiners et al., 2004). Therefore, data on the influence of different species configurations on understory vegetation restoration in the absence of human interference over 10-yrs are meaningful for coastal vegetation management. Land rehabilitation through reestablishment of native trees is becoming increasingly attractive because native trees have been shown to improve soil conditions significantly on badly degraded tropical l and (Fisher, 1995). Soil pH is considered a master variable in soils as it controls many chemical processes. It specifically affects plant nutrient availability by controlling the chemical forms of the nutrients. McTlwee and NeSmith (1971) indicated that the optimum pH range for most plants is between 5.5 and 7.0. Although many plants have adapted to thrive at pH values outside of this range, very high soil pH values strongly influence the ''boom and bust'' development of coastal plant communities. Our study shows that planting native species, especially M. azedarach, lowers the soil pH even when mixed with C. equisetifolia. For each native species, soil pH decreased more in level I than level II. Soil organic matter is the main source of nutrients for plant growth and soil development, and it can improve soil physical properties and accelerate the activities of microorganisms (Bot and Benites, 2005). Because C. equisetifolia litter decomposes very slowly, the organic matter content is low and easily lost in a coastal sandy soils (Wheeler et al., 2011). In our experiment, the soil organic matter increases significantly in plots planted with M. azedarach and C. equisetifolia over 10-yrs.",

Although soil OM declined in plots planted with C. inophyllum (I and II), but the decrement was significantly less than that of the C. equisetifolia stand. Although the species used in our study are not nitrogen-fixing plant, native species (M. azedarach especially) effectively increased the soil total N when interplanted with the nitrogen-fixing plant C. equisetifolia. These changes in soil conditions might result from litter effects or the recruitment of understory vegetation, but this hypothesis has not yet to be confirmed.",

During recent centuries, the conversion of rangelands into croplands has increased the surfaces prone to erosion. In the southern Pre-Pyrenees, the process was reversed during the middle of the twentieth century, allowing the recovery of vegetation and subsequent variation in land cover. This work aims to assess how land use changes after generalised land abandonment affect some major soil properties related to soil quality. For this purpose, 98 replicate bulk soil samples were collected in a 23 km 2 catchment that was mostly cultivated at the beginning of the last century. Soil samples were distributed over areas representing the main land uses (agricultural land, natural forest, pine afforestation and scrubland). Bulk density, stoniness, grain size, pH, carbonates, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water retention capacity and magnetic properties (low frequency magnetic susceptibility (LF) and frequency dependence (FD)) were analysed in the samples from different land use areas. A past scenario was recreated using estimated data from the SPEROS-C model in order to evaluate changes in SOC over time. Furthermore, a multitemporal analysis of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index of Landsat images was performed between 1972 and the present in order to assess the dynamics of revegetation. After land abandonment, 16.5% of the area remained as croplands, but afforestation and natural revegetation occupied 83.5% of the catchment. The highest mean value for SOC was found in the pine afforested area and the highest TN mean value was found in the natural forest. The lowest mean values for SOC and TN were recorded on the agricultural land. These results show the impact of soil changes produced by land use changes in fragile Mediterranean mountain agroecosystems.",
        "051cd898-e8ab-4a59-9be1-073c3c5e22f3": "Changes in land use due to human activities are a widespread problem that often lead to land degradation, and are of considerable concern worldwide in the context of environmental degradation and global climate change (Celik, 2005). Over recent centuries, human activities have been the main drivers of ecosystem transformations through the conversion of natural landscapes into agricultural lands (Chauchard et al., 2007). The conversion of rangeland into cropland due to agricultural deforestation is a local and global environmental issue (Foley et al., 2005), resulting in changing soil properties and soil infiltration rates, and modifying soil physical characteristics that eventually increase soil erosion (Li et al., 2007). Poor soil management can rapidly deteriorate vast areas of land, and is becoming a major threat to rural subsistence in many countries (Chauchard et al., 2007). The problems that these practices have created are particularly remarkable in mountainous areas and in regions with adverse environmental conditions (MacDonald et al., 2000), such as in Mediterranean mountains where the natural forest has been progressively cleared and replaced by croplands (Alonso-Sarr\u00eda et al., 2016). These changes lead to losses of soil nutrients and reduced long-term soil productivity. Mediterranean mountains are sensitive agroecosystems prone to land degradation, due to their climatic conditions characterised by irregular space-time distribution of high intensity rainfall events, followed by long dry periods (Mariani and Parisi, 2014). There has also been strong anthropogenic pressure during the past centuries (Romany\u00e0 and Rovira, 2011;Bruun et al., 2015). In the twentieth century, following socioeconomic changes, land abandonment notably increased from the mid-1950s onwards, leading to depopulation of rural areas and substantial landscape changes (Lasanta et al., 2016;Quijano et al., 2016aQuijano et al., , 2016b;;Navas et al., 2017).",

It has thus received increasing attention in the last decade for the purpose of deriving ecological measures that correlate with surface biophysical properties (Myneni et al., 1995). Such studies have confirmed the potential of remote sensing techniques for the estimation of different vegetation parameters that are directly related to plant vigour, density, and growth conditions and can be used to detect environmental conditions, human activities and modifications of the vegetation cover produced by land use changes (Melendez-Pastor et al., 2016). The most frequently used vegetation index is the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as described by Rouse et al. (1974). It is also used as vegetation status data source in many environmental modelling approaches and ecological studies (Li et al., 2004;Pettorelli et al., 2005;Krishnaswamy et al., 2009). Several studies have tried to predict different soil properties and soil quality by combining remote sensing and soil sampling data (Ben-Dor and Banin, 1995;V\u00e5gen et al., 2013V\u00e5gen et al., , 2016;;Winowiecki et al., 2016). Most of these studies have included large agricultural areas, but few of them have considered mountain agroecosystems. Tillage practices expose the less fertile subsoil, affecting the physical, biochemical and magnetic properties of the soil (Rahimi et al., 2013;Gao et al., 2017). Among the most important effects of continuous conventional tillage practices during recent centuries are changes in the soil organic carbon content (Bruce et al., 1999;Novara et al., 2015;Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara et al., 2015;Boix-Fayos et al., 2017).",

Due to a general lack of soil samples from past decades, SOC dynamic models have been developed to understand the short and long-term impact of land management on SOC stocks. This is the case for the SPEROS-C model (Van Oost et al., 2005) that combines the soil erosion SPEROS model (Van Oost et al., 2003) and the SOC dynamics Introductory Carbon Balance Model (Andr\u00e9n and K\u00e4tterer, 1997), which was implemented in our study catchment by Quijano et al. (2017). A major issue in Mediterranean agroecosystems is the effect of the abandonment of agricultural land in recent decades and its subsequent natural revegetation, as well as afforestation practices, on the variations of soil properties. There have been very few studies that asses these variations at the catchment scale (Navas et al., 2008;Nadal-Romero et al., 2016). One of the properties most sensitive to land use change is the soil organic carbon content that may increase or decrease depending on the previous land uses. We hypothesise that changes in agricultural management from conventional to conservation tillage practices, and increases in vegetation due to natural revegetation after abandonment of cultivated land lead to increases in SOC stocks. To date, only a few studies have focussed on this issue in Mediterranean agroecosystems (Francaviglia et al., 2012;Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2017). The novelty of this study arises from two main aspects, combining NDVI from remote sensing data with soil nutrients as a tool for assessing temporal changes along with modelling and reconstructing the past SOC stocks at catchment scale. Furthermore, to our knowledge there are no published studies that use remote sensing data to discriminate and analyse different land uses and their changes over time, comparing satellite with soil sampling data.",

In this catchment we: i) estimate the variation in the percentage vegetation cover during the successional changes of natural revegetation using the NDVI derived from remote sensed data; ii) identify the spatial patterns of major soil properties and the differences between land uses; iii) compare the NDVI with the distribution of soil nutrients to assess the impact of revegetation recovery in different land use areas; iv) test the previous hypotheses on the variations of SOC stocks due to land uses changes by applying a spatial distributed model, the SPEROS-C model (Van Oost et al., 2005). Therefore our multi-approach is aimed to determine how soil properties have changed in the last decades after land abandonment and subsequent natural revegetation and afforestation. The conditions of the study catchment represent a unique opportunity to track variations in soil properties associated with vegetation cover changes using satellite images from 1972 to present.",

According to Champion and Seth (1968), the Shisham tree is a characteristic species of Khair\u00b1Sissoo (Acacia catechu\u00b1 Dalbergia sissoo) primary seral type forest. Shisham occurs naturally throughout the sub-Himalayan tract and outer Himalayan valley from the Indus to Assam, usually at elevations of about 900 m, but sometimes occurring up to 1500 m. Shisham is found either in a pure forest stand or together with other species, commonly Khair (Acacia catechu). Shisham is a good example of a pioneer species in the riverain succession of the Gangetic alluvial plains in India. Shisham usually regenerates naturally on recently laid down terraces of rivers, on freshly exposed soils, road cuttings, fresh embankment and landslips where drainage is good and there is suf\u00aecient soil aeration. However, Shisham shows remarkable variation in growth pattern and yield per unit area because it is adapted to a wide range of ecological habitats which thus in\u00afuence its dry matter production. Shisham is a very hardy species and produces valuable timber. Trees shed leaves from October to February; new leaves appear between February and April. Shisham can be propagated both by seeds and vegetative parts.

The topography (slope, position, and topographical direction -referred to as \"aspect\"), together with elevation, plays an important role with respect to temperature and moisture regimes due to differences in insolation period according to site aspect, affecting microclimate development (Griffiths et al., 2009), and differences in microclimate affects the distribution of plant communities as well as soil processes (Lenka et al., 2013;Bochet, 2015). Solar radiation influences the temperature regime, which affects vegetation distribution and soil biological and chemical processes (Bale et al., 1998). Consequently, soil temperature is an important factor that controls the rate of decomposition of biomass. As a consequence, soils in warm climates usually contain less organic matter (OM) than soils in cooler climates due to higher mineralization rates (Ping et al., 2015). In contrast, the SOC content increases when the average annual rainfall increases (Meier and Leuschner, 2010). Therefore, aspect can affect SOC distribution, either retarding or accelerating SOC decomposition; by affecting microorganism activity through its influence on soil temperature and water content (Scowcroft et al., 2008). Generally speaking, we can say that the capacity of forest soils in mountainous areas to store organic C depends on parameters such as elevation because temperature regime and precipitation vary with elevation (Djukic et al., 2010;Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara et al., 2015a), aspect and slope position (Perruchoud et al., 2000), bed rock material and texture (Hoffmann et al., 2009), pH (Falloon and Smith, 2009), topography (Yoo et al., 2006), vegetation and stand age of the forest (Luyssaert et al., 2008), and disturbances (human and natural) (Morgan et al., 2010).",
        "0fc1f500-e926-4c38-9d90-7c797bd579cf": "SOC pools are important for reducing the net CO 2 loading to the atmosphere (Brevik, 2012;Srinivasarao et al., 2014). In addition, SOC concentration is closely related to soil quality (Brevik, 2009) and this is especially important in Mediterranean areas (Francaviglia et al., 2014;Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara et al., 2015b). Forests are important ecosystems because they provide wood products to society as well as others important ecosystem services, such as recreation, habitat functions, water regulation, water erosion control, and improved air quality, among others. However, society has recently focused its attention on forest ecosystems for two reasons; C sequestration on the one hand, and biomass provision for bioenergy on the other; this also illustrates the possible trade-offs even within the theme of climate change mitigation (Zanchi et al., 2010). Over time, forest surface area has decreased as human development has increased. During the past century this trend has been reversed in Spain, as well as in Europe (MAGRAMA, 2014). Forest area now represents 34% of the land area in Europe and 35.6% in Spain (FAO, 2012;MAGRAMA, 2014). During the 20th century an intense policy of reforestations was carried out in Spain because the Iberian landscapes were drastically deforested. Spanish authorities considered that forest cover regeneration was an urgent social need. The different administrations' efforts resulted, to a great extent, in the recovery of vegetation during the century. Their achievements must be taken into consideration when the current landscape composition is analyzed (Valbuena-Caraba\u00f1a et al., 2010). Two primary actions were developed under these reforestation policies: the introduction of more fast-growing tree species (pinus spp. against original vegetation species) and the transformation of pasture land in forest areas (FAO, 1958).",
        "9164f125-9a0e-4f1a-beba-08e17bbc0be7": "Therefore, there are currently a lot of forest areas in Spain in which the introduced species coexist with native species, such as in the Despe\u00f1aperros Natural Park (Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara, 2001). Generally soils in the Mediterranean region are characterized by low OM content (around 1%) due to the great majority of them being agricultural soils, meaning these soils have low C additions from plant residues, low-density tree cover, and they are subjected to management practices that lead to C losses (Verheye and De la Rosa, 2005;Cerd\u00e0 et al., in press). In Mediterranean forest areas the effect is the opposite, as many of these forest soils are rich in OM; as a result, these soils store a large amount of C affecting the global C cycle. This means that these soils are characterized by high SOC (Nabuurs et al., 1997;Lal, 2005;FAO, 2010). The nitrogen stocks (N\u2032S), as well as the SOCS, are strongly influenced by the land use and management. Proper management can increase N\u2032S following a land use change (Blanco-Canqui and Lal, 2008;Lozano-Garc\u00eda and Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara, 2013a). Also, the addition of organic wastes during restoration practices can increase stocks because they create OM additions (Lenka et al., 2013;Lozano-Garc\u00eda and Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara, 2013b). Topographical position can also affect stocks in that stocks may increase along the toeslope due to the deposition of soil eroded from higher topographic positions or decrease at higher topographical positions because of erosion or, in the case of significant elevation changes, corresponding changes in the climatic conditions (Fern\u00e1ndez-Romero et al., 2014;Lozano-Garc\u00eda and Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara, 2014) and the topographic aspect (Yimer et al., 2006;Lenka et al., 2013).",
        "37dee73c-b97f-4a2e-b52f-8900ab22469b": "However, this last factor affecting SOC stocks is less studied than the other factors. Soil quality is often expressed only in terms of tree growth or biomass production, which is only one of several important functions of soil (i.e. regulating water quality and quantity, carbon sequestration, remediation of human and animal wastes, regulating energy flow\u2026 among other factors (Brevik et al., 2015b)). Scientists have focused on developing techniques for soil quality evaluation, however no consensus has been found with regard to the exact characteristics of those soils that are considered to be of the highest quality (Duval et al., 2013). It is often easy to find studies in which stratification ratios (SR) are calculated as a soil quality index in agricultural soils (L\u00f3pez-Fando and Pardo, 2011;Dikgwatlhe et al., 2014;Parras-Alc\u00e1ntara and Lozano-Garc\u00eda, 2014) but this measure is not easily applied to forest soils. There are many studies in which physical, chemical or biological properties are used to measure forest soil quality (Burger and Kelting, 1999;Schoenholtz et al., 2000;Zornoza et al., 2007), but it is often difficult to clearly separate soil functions into chemical, physical, and biological processes because of the interactive and dynamic nature of these processes. In this sense, the stratification ratio (SR) index of SOC and N\u2032 with depth are good indicators of soil functioning (Franzluebbers, 2002;S\u00e1 and Lal, 2009) and reflect the interactions between C and N\u2032 (Puget and Lal, 2005;Lou et al., 2012). The SR of each property can be related to an aspect of soil quality.",
        "915d95ce-5531-4cac-bfc2-251bd523f36b": "The SR of each property can be related to an aspect of soil quality. A higher SR of SOC indicates that soil management has enhanced soil quality, this is because the top layer of the soil is highly influenced by land management but the deeper layers are less affected (Franzluebbers, 2002(Franzluebbers, , 2010;;Ferreira et al., 2012). This indicator is especially relevant for Mediterranean areas, given the limitations to SOC accumulation that derive from climatic conditions. Furthermore, high SOC and N\u2032 SR values reflect undisturbed soil and high soil quality of the surface layer, even though SOC quantities may not be high (Franzluebbers 2002;Corral-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013;Francaviglia et al., 2014). Although the impact of topographic aspect on SOC, N\u2032 (Yimer et al., 2006) and vegetation types (Bale et al., 1998) is widely recognized, relatively few studies have been conducted to examine the role of aspect on SOC and N\u2032 contents globally. Therefore, the goals of this study are (i) to estimate the SOCS and N\u2032S in the mineral soils of a well preserved natural park, (ii) to determine how aspect and vegetation type (native or introduced species) can affect soil capacity to store SOC and N\u2032 and (iii) to investigate the soil quality using SR indexes in the Despe\u00f1aperros Natural Park (South Spain-Mediterranean area).",

However, scientific understanding of the ecological processes responsible for forest restoration is poor. We review the literature to synthesize the current state of understanding of tropical forest restoration from a biogeochemical point of view. Aboveground biomass and soil carbon accumulation of restored tropical forests are a function of age, climate, and past land use. Restored forests in wet life zones accumulate more biomass than those in moist or dry life zones. Forests restored on degraded sites accumulate less aboveground biomass than forests restored on pastures or agricultural land. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation in restored forests are lower than during natural succession, particularly during the first decades of forest establishment. Rates of litterfall, biomass production, soil carbon accumulation, and nutrient accumulation peak during the first few decades of restored forest establishment and decline in mature stages. Changes in species composition and canopy closure influence the rate of primary productivity of older restored stands. Species composition also influences the rate and concentration of nutrient return to the forest floor. The ratio of primary productivity to biomass is high in young restored forests and low in mature stands irrespective of climate. The ratio is low when past land use has little effect on biomass accumulation, and high when past land uses depresses biomass accumulation. This effect is due to a high rate of litterfall in restored forests, which helps restore soil by circulating more nutrients and biomass per unit biomass accumulated in the stand. The degree of site degradation and propagule availability dictates the establishment and growth of tree species. Reestablishment of forest conditions and the enrichment of sites by plant and animal species invasions lead to faster rates of succession, aboveground primary productivity, and biomass accumulation in restored forests. Our review demonstrates that nutrient cycling pathways and nutrient use efficiency are critical for interpreting the suitability of tree species to different conditions in forest stands undergoing restoration.",
        "da12a6cd-a0f0-4692-9017-6a5a33550ef4": "The restoration of tropical forests is a matter of concern due to the importance of maintaining land productivity and sustaining the economies of tropical countries (Brown and Lugo, 1994). We use the term restoration to mean the restoration of forests, irrespective of species composition, on deforested lands by rehabilitating forest conditions and site productivity (Brown and Lugo, 1994). There is a clear tendency in the tropics for addressing the problem of degraded lands through reforestation and afforestation projects. For example, the area of tree plantation in the 90 countries monitored by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1993) increased by 150% at an annual rate of 2.6 million ha between 1980 and 1990 and 2.0 million ha a -1 between 1990 and 2000 (FAO, 2001b). The purpose of many of these plantations is for land protection or rehabilitation. Numerous literature reports of successes of both small and large-scale restoration projects in the tropics further demonstrate the increasing importance of tropical forest restoration (e.g., Field, 1996;Parrotta and Turnbull, 1997;FAO, 2001a). Nevertheless, the area subjected to restoration and rehabilitation is still small (13%) in comparison to the area deforested annually in the tropics (FAO, 2001b). There are many techniques for restoring tropical forests, and several authors have reviewed them (e.g., Brown and Lugo, 1994;Parrotta and Turnbull, 1997;Ashton et al., 2001). The many techniques for restoring species-rich tropical forests on degraded lands involve two basic approaches. The first approach involves planting one or more tree species, and allowing them to develop into species-rich forests. A second approach is allowing natural regeneration and succession, either accelerated or not by humans, to proceed to mature states. Usually, management objectives, site conditions, and availability of resources determine which approach to use.",
        "b95c89d7-0752-4ed9-a798-f39352156d7e": "Usually, management objectives, site conditions, and availability of resources determine which approach to use. However, where soil degradation is extreme, as occurs after mining activities, tree planting is required to restore forest conditions because arrested succession prevents natural forest regeneration (Parrotta and Turnbull, 1997). The scientific understanding of tropical forest restoration lags behind the practice of restoring such forests. Much progress is possible without scientific understanding when restoring tropical forests in deforested lands because tropical succession can rapidly reestablish forest cover on most abandoned sites. However, overcoming arrested succession requires human intervention and technical knowledge to restore forests. The complexity of tropical forests is a major reason for the knowledge gap about their ecology and silviculture. Most of the literature addresses the species aspects of the activity (what species to plant or favor, how to promote or accelerate species richness, how to deal with alien species, etc.) and there is very little work on biogeochemistry. Moreover, it takes about 100 years for planted or fallowed forest stands to reach maturity in the tropics (Brown and Lugo, 1990), and we lack long-term studies of the successional process and biogeochemistry in these systems. As a result, a definitive synthesis of organic matter and nutrient dynamics in restored forests is not possible at this time. We present case-study information on rates of organic matter and nutrient accumulation of tropical forests that were either restored through planting on degraded lands and allowed to mature as mixed species forests, or restored naturally and matured after abandonment of various types of land use. The case studies include a species-rich forest restored in Puerto Rico through planting on pastures on a moist site (La Condesa in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, LEF), and species-rich forests restored through both planting and natural succession after abandonment of various land uses on dry (Gu\u00e1nica Forest) and wet (LEF and the Amazon) forest sites. We compare the results from these case studies with forest regeneration (natural and planted) elsewhere in the tropics. Our objective is to identify the range of rate processes associated with restored tropical forests and some of the primary mechanisms that might affect those rates.",

        "3e1ab9e2-7e54-417d-8c35-ceff860b4b0b": "From a biogeochemical point of view, restored tropical forests contend with degraded sites where nutrient supply, soil structure, and soil water are not optimal for normal tree regeneration and growth. The level of land degradation limits the capacity of forest stands to acquire nutrients and accumulate biomass. When land degradation is extreme, tree planting is necessary and selection of species, and even fertilization and watering, are needed because tree species differ in their water-and nutrient-use efficiency, and in their capacity for fostering other species (Lugo et al., 1990a, b;Wang et al., 1991;Parrotta, 1995;Cuevas and Lugo, 1998;Montagnini, 2001Montagnini, , 2002)). In addition, the success of tree establishment depends on the ability to concentrate nutrients and water from the soil. Nepstad et al. (2001) showed that roots of secondary forest species in the Amazon had the capacity of reaching up to 8 m into the soil profile within 10 to 15 yr of establishment on high bulk density soils. They also had a higher rate of mycorhizal infestations than species of mature forests. The outcome was that within this short time, these secondary forest species were able to restore normal functioning in terms of nutrient and water uptake and recycling. Once a forest is established, it appears that restored forests attain high ratios of organic matter production to biomass (Figure 2) and their nutrient accumulation and cycling rates (Figure 3) reach levels similar to those of native forests. However, restored forests are young in relation to primary forests and lag mature forests in structural complexity, including coarse woody debris, habitat diversity, biomass (Figure 1), nutrient pools (Table I), and species richness. Rates of organic matter production and nutrient accumulation are high early in the life of a forest stand and decrease with age or time since disturbance (Figures 1a and3). The first decade of forest establishment is a time of rapid exchange of organic matter and nutrients between vegetation and soil.",
        "b3e148f0-cab5-437e-9370-370917a2815a": "Such high rates of exchange influence soil fertility and soil organic matter (Reddy, 2002), as was demonstrated by Silver et al. (2000) in a literature review and by Silver et al. (in press) at La Condesa. In that forest (Table IV), it took several decades for trees to reverse the soil carbon balance from a source to a sink, and allow a significant acceleration of aboveground primary productivity. The measured changes at La Condesa were associated with a change in tree species composition from the 13 initially planted on 1937 to 75 species at age 55. It is apparent that species composition is an important aspect of the establishment and functioning of restored forests. Part of the reason is that under degraded conditions the initial pool of species available for colonization is small and usually alien. Restorationists have opportunities to match species to sites, particularly when site conditions are extreme. Because species differ in the acquisition, retranslocation, and nutrient return capacity, they can either accelerate nutrient cycling or slow it down. As species richness increases, natural forces and self-organization come into play and it is not practical to control the species composition of restored sites. As a result, nutrient and biomass dynamics approach those of natural forests. The time required to attain high rates of primary productivity and nutrient cycling takes decades and depends on the severity of the original land degradation.",

At the same time, awareness of the high carbon (C) sink potential of mangrove forests is growing, and C sequestration is beginning to be considered among forestation goals. To assess whether and at what rate C accumulates in the soil of young mangrove forests following afforestation, we conducted a field study at an afforestation project in southeast China, including repeated measures taken over six years at two young forests (consisting of Kandelia obovata and Sonneratia apetala, aged 0e6 years old), and also a chronosequence of forests aged 0 (mudflat), 6 (both species), 20 (S. apetala), and 70 (K. obovata) years old. In the repeated measures, surface (0e10 cm) soil C concentration (%C of dry soil mass) increased significantly over six years, from 1.14% to 1.52% (K. obovata) and 1.23% to 1.68% (S. apetala). The rates of increase did not differ significantly between the two species, despite much greater biomass of S. apetala. In the chronosequence, soil C also increased with age across sites, but only the 70-year-old forest was statistically different, suggesting that localized environmental differences may obscure age-related patterns in soil C. At all sites, soil C concentration for 1-m soil depth (0.62%e2.43%) was low compared to published global averages, yet the estimated soil C accumulation rate (155 g C m \u00c02 y \u00c01 ) was comparable to published averages for mature forests. We supported this field study with a literature review of similar studies containing soil C concentration data from young mangrove forests: data compiled from 15 studies, comprising 31 sites, showed consistent, positive changes in soil C concentration with forest age, even in the youngest (<5 years old) forests, supporting our field observation that soil C increases over time following mangrove afforestation.",
        "257ea88b-8adb-461e-8dde-376cfa82ab77": "Recent studies have shown that coastal wetlands such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds are among the most efficient carbon (C) sinks on the planet (Donato et al., 2011). Reviews of the available data estimate that carbon sequestration in these systems (popularly termed \"blue carbon\") per unit area is on average more than an order of magnitude higher than terrestrial forests. These blue carbon systems are also among the most threatened ecosystems on the planet. For mangroves, the most recent areal estimates range from 13.8 million to 16.7 million ha (Valiela et al., 2001;Giri et al., 2011), which is a 20% reduction since 1980, and an estimated 35% loss compared to historical extents (Valiela et al., 2001;FAO, 2007). To address this trend, mangrove reforestation and afforestation programs (collectively referred to as forestation in this study, unless otherwise specified) have been initiated in many countries over the past few decades (Field, 1998;Ellison, 2000). The earliest forestation efforts were essentially silviculture-oriented, while more recent projects have included ecological objectives, such as shoreline stabilization and environmental remediation (Ellison, 2000). With increasing concerns related to climate change, carbon sequestration is also beginning to be considered among conservation and forestation goals (Murray et al., 2011). An example of this trend is the recent release of guidelines for C sequestration accounting in mangrove restoration projects certified under the Cleaner Development Mechanism (CDM) program of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2011). In mangrove forests, a large proportiondfrom half to over 90%d of total ecosystem C is found in soil organic matter as opposed to biomass (Alongi et al., 2003;Khan et al., 2007;Donato et al., 2011). Direct measurements of soil C accumulation in young forestation projects are scarce, however.",
        "4f50dc04-3600-4ba0-b7cf-a6a0a9ac1adf": "Direct measurements of soil C accumulation in young forestation projects are scarce, however. Several reviews of C sequestration in mangrove soil have been published recently (e.g. Bouillon et al., 2008;Mcleod et al., 2011;Alongi, 2012), but such reviews focus on mature forests and the existing data appear to be biased toward highly organic systems (Kristensen et al., 2008). Similarly, reviews of mangrove restoration projects (e.g. Bosire et al., 2008) provide data on post-restoration biomass accumulation, but not soil properties. Along these lines, CDM approval of restoration projects does not require soil C monitoring before or during the project lifetime. Of the published data that do exist, only a few studies provide direct measurements of change in soil C using repeated measures over time (Ren et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2012). Several more have used forestation chronosequences (a.k.a. space for time substitution) (e.g. Bosire et al., 2003;Alongi et al., 2004;Ren et al., 2008), and additional insight has been gained from similar studies of natural chronosequences, in which forest age varies in relation to naturally changing coastal conditions (Marchand et al., 2003;Lovelock et al., 2010). In contrast, much more is known about soil C accumulation in terrestrial forestation projects, and several reviews have been written on this topic (Paul et al., 2002;Berthrong et al., 2009;Laganiere et al., 2010). Such studies have found that on average across all projects, soil C initially decreases following afforestation, and may maintain a deficit for up to 30 years (Paul et al., 2002). However, the results vary significantly depending on forestation species, previous land use, soil clay content, and climate. Mangroves allocate a large proportion of biomass belowground compared to many terrestrial tree species (Lovelock, 2008), so we hypothesize that soil C would increase relatively sooner following forestation.",

China lies at the northern edge of global mangrove distribution, and similar to other countries with mangroves, has experienced drastic losses in forest cover in recent history. The most recent estimate of mangrove cover is 22,700 ha (Chen et al., 2009), less than a third of the historical extent (Li and Lee, 1997). To address this loss, the Chinese government began investing in mangrove reforestation in the early 1990s (Zheng et al., 2003), and by 2002 more than 2600 ha (more than 10% of the existing area) were replanted (Chen et al., 2009). This reforestation program presents an opportunity to study soil C accumulation in young forests following afforestation, including results across different species. Of particular interest is Sonneratia apetala, a non-native mangrove species from Bangladesh introduced to China in 1985, which has been used for approximately half the country's forestation projects so far (Chen et al., 2009). Kandelia obovata, a native mangrove species distributed along the southeast Chinese coast, has also been widely used in mangrove forestation (Chen et al., 2009). Previous research has shown that S. apetala has much higher rates of biomass C accumulation than most native species (Ren et al., 2008(Ren et al., , 2010)). Ren et al.'s (2008) study also found higher soil C values in S. apetala forests compared to neighboring native forests, suggesting that S. apetala may have higher rates of C accumulation in soil as well as biomass. According to the soil development model proposed by Chen and Twilley (1999), soil C is correlated with biomass inputs to soil, particularly root biomass. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that soil C will accumulate faster in S. apetala forests.",

In this study, we aimed to assess whether, and at what rate, soil C content increases over time in young, afforested mangrove forests. To achieve this, we collected two distinct data sets at four young forests in a mangrove forestation project in southeast China. The first data set consisted of repeated measures of surface soil C concentration taken in two young forests (K. obovata and S. apetala) from age 0 to 6 years old. The second data set consisted of a chronosequence (one-time measurements) of 1-m soil cores taken at the two 6-year-old forests, a 20-year-old S. apetala forest, a 70year-old K. obovata forest, and a nearby mudflat. Using these data sets, we tested the hypotheses 1) that soil C increases with forest age following mangrove forestation, even in very young forests; and 2) that soil C accumulates more quickly in forested S. apetala, compared to K. obovata plots, due to higher rates of above-and belowground biomass growth in the former species. To support our first hypothesis, we also compiled all available data (published and unpublished) on soil C change in young mangrove forests, aiming to assess whether trends in the literature support or refute the results of this field study.",

The objective of this study was to understand the stand dynamics of the planted mangroves and their functional traits in comparison with natural mangrove forests under similar site conditions.\nMethodsSpecies composition, stand density, tree size distribution, and aboveground production were investigated along three transects in a 50year-old planted mangrove stand and three transects in an adjacent natural mangrove stand in Shenzhen Bay, South China. Measurements were made on tree distribution by species, stand structure, and aboveground biomass (AGB) distribution. Analyses were performed on the spatial patterns of tree size distribution and species association.\nImportant FindingsWe found that the planted and natural mangrove stands did not differ in stand density, average diameter at breast height (DBH), species composition, and AGB. Spatial distribution of AGB and frequency at species level were also similar between the planted and natural stands. However, the traits in stand structure were more variable in the planted stand than in the natural stand, indicating higher spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the development and succession of planted mangroves. Geostatistical analyses show that both DBH and AGB were spatially auto-correlated within a specific range in the direction perpendicular to coastline. More than 60% of the variance in these attributes was due to spatial autocorrelation. The Ripley's K-function analysis shows that the two dominant species, Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, clumped in broader scales in the natural stand than in the planted stand and displayed significant interspecific competition across the whole transect. It is suggested that interspecific competition interacts with spatial autocorrelation as the underlying mechanism shaping the mangrove structure. This study demonstrates that at age 50, mangrove plantations can perform similarly in stand structure, spatial arrangement of selected stand characteristics and species associations to the natural mangrove forests.",

However, clearing for aquaculture and other land uses has caused a sharp decline in mangrove forests worldwide, such that over the past half century, more than one-third of the mangrove forests have vanished, mainly due to various anthropogenic activities (Alongi 2002;Valiela et al. 2001). To save mangroves from extinction and to reverse the trend of declining mangrove forests, planting has been widely practiced to restore or rehabilitate this special type of ecosystem (Ellison 2000;Field 1998;Walters 2003). Despite being species poor, mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems (Kathiresan and Bingham 2001). Globally, the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangrove forests varies over a large range, from only 6.8 to as much as 436.4 Mg ha \u00c01 (Saenger and Snedaker 1993), and aboveground net primary productivity varies between 6.9 and 75.6 Mg ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 (Sherman et al. 2003). The carbon accumulation of the planted mangroves is comparable to that of the natural mangroves (Field 1998;Kairo et al. 2008). For example, in a 7year-old Rhizophora mucronata plantation in Tritih, Indonesia, the total AGB reached 94 Mg ha \u00c01 (Sukardjo and Yamada 1992), whereas in a 12-year-old R. mucronata plantation at Gazi Bay, Kenya, the standing biomass amounted to 107 Mg ha \u00c01 (Kairo et al. 2008).",
        "2beaeff4-75ba-415a-9af6-0fa597108e6a": "2008). Apart from the absolute value, that how AGB is partitioned among species can affect ecosystem functioning (Grime 1998) and indicate productivity, availability and heterogeneity of resources and stand structure at community level (Edelkraut and Gu \u00a8sewell 2006;Luzuriaga et al. 2002;Parsons et al. 1994). Mangroves developed from different planting schemes have been shown to display distinct allocation of biomass among species, leading to marked differences in nutrient absorption and return rate (Liao et al. 1999). Structural heterogeneity is an important ecosystem attribute. Most of the mangrove species have specific zonation in the intertidal area, which is one of the most important structural features of mangrove forests and is the basis for the functioning of mangrove ecosystems (Bunt 1996;Lugo 1980). In order to understand the functional traits of mangroves, it is important to examine their structural features. Analyses of the spatial pattern of trees can provide valuable information on the underlying processes, such as intra-and interspecific interaction, and the effects of environmental heterogeneity. At local scales, spatial pattern of natural mangrove stands closely links with soil properties, disturbance history, and predation or attack of propagules by understory animals (Ball 2002;Clarke and Allaway 1993;Feller et al. 2002;Sousa et al. 2003). For planted forests, a recent study on the upland forest ecosystems shows that the spatial pattern of trees is largely the results of the silvicultural method and the natural regeneration (Maestre et al. 2005). McKee and Faulkner (2000) found that site-specific as well as regional or local differences in hydrology-related factors, such as salinity and soil waterlogging, could have a strong influence on the functional outcomes of planted mangroves in their early development. The underlying mechanisms controlling the development of mangroves can be greatly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance; this influence has been shown to last for >20 years (Ferwerda et al. 2007).",

In recent years, large areas of mangrove forests have been established with selected mangrove species on previously mangrove-inhabited sites of the tropical and subtropical coasts of southern China. The practice is aimed for facilitating faster restoration of coastal ecosystem structure and functions. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the structure and function of natural mangroves and relatively young stands of planted mangroves (e.g. <10 years) in the coasts of southern China (see reviews by Lin 1997 andChen et al. 2009). Zan et al. (2001) found that mangrove plantations had fast growth rates and varied greatly in species composition and stand structure during the first several years after planting. However, information is lacking on how well the planted mangroves may perform compared with natural mangrove forests and whether the planted mangroves can reach the same stand structural complexity as the natural mangroves for a given time, especially after several decades of planting. To address these concerns, we studied species composition, stand density, tree size distribution, and aboveground production along three transects in a 50-year-old planted mangrove stand and three transects in an adjacent natural mangrove stand in Shenzhen Bay, South China. Geostatistical tools were used to analyze the spatial patterns of tree size in terms of AGB and diameter at breast height (DBH); Ripley's K-functions were used to examine associations of mangrove species. We mainly focused on two questions: (i) what is the spatial relationship among and within mangrove species in both planted and natural mangrove stands; and (ii) would the planted mangroves develop similar structural complexity to the natural mangroves after 50 years of planting?",

Our results indicate that the planted mangroves can be comparable to the natural mangroves in stand structure after 50 years of planting and that the species distribution and tree size (DBH and AGB) are spatially auto-correlated to some extent. K. obovata and A. marina dominate the mangrove forests of the study site with their own separate zo-nation, which could be explained by significant intraspecific clumping and interspecific competition. Forest structure and function vary with development and succession, and the planted and natural forests generally have respective characteristicsin differentdevelopmentstages (Barlow et al. 2007;Guariguata and Ostertag 2001;Lugo 1992). Proffitt and Devlin (2005) found that an 11-year-old Rhizophora mangle plantation was comparable with the natural mangrove stand in species richness, vegetation cover, litterfall and light penetration but had considerably smaller trees and higher stand density. In this study, we also did not find significant differences in stand structure, AGB, resource allocation and spatial tree distribution between planted and natural mangroves at age ;50 (Fig. 2), similar to the findings of Lugo (1992) comparing 50-year-old planted and natural mangroves. However, the planted mangrove stand was more variable in specific stand characteristics than the natural mangrove stand in our study. This greater variation in the planted mangrove stand reflects high spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the development and succession of planted mangroves and indirectly demonstrates the sensitivity of plantation to fluctuation of environmental conditions, such as climatic disturbance and pathogenic outbreak, during succession. Different mangrove species have distinct zonations. This unique characteristic of mangrove species may significantly influence the structure and function of monocultural mangrove plantation with succession.",

Furthermore, the planted mangrove stand extended less into the sea than the natural mangrove stand, albeit similar species composition and stand structure between the two types of stands.   Tree size distribution is an important attribute reflecting forest development and successional stage. Our analyses of the distribution of DBH and AGB, which characterize the tree size, indicate that in the direction perpendicular to coastline, the two variables are apparently spatially structured and the average range of spatial correlation is larger than the whole transect length. Moreover, the experimental semivariogram of these variables is linear. These results are consistent with studies in upland forests and indicate that neighborhood competition plays an important role in regulating spatial structure of tree size (Biondi et al. 1994;Kuuluvainen et al. 1998;Nanos et al. 2004). The planted mangrove stand displayed greater variance of semivariogram, and greater positive skew in tree size distribution than the natural mangrove stand, demonstrating    the greater neighborhood competition or self-thinning in the planted mangroves. Compared with the natural mangrove stand, the planted stand was characterized by having greater number of smaller trees after 50 years of development, indicating the early stage of stand development. Liao et al. (2004) found that the mangrove communities at our study site were under a strong influence of self-thinning, suggesting the occurrence of a dynamic stand developmental process. Similar to many upland tree species (Condit et al. 2000;Wolf 2005), the two dominant mangrove species in our study, K. obovata and A. marina, are clumped to some extent. There are apparent differences in clump intensity between the two species but not between the two stand types.",

Studies of the underlying mechanisms that control this phenomenon of zonation have traditionally focused on the effects of light condition (Ball 2002;Clarke and Allaway 1993), soil heterogeneity (Chen and Twilley 1999;Ellison et al. 2000;Feller et al. 2002;Matthijs et al. 1999;McKee 1993), crab predation on propagules (Clarke and Kerrigan 2002;Smith 1987), or a combination of these factors, on early growth of mangrove species. Our study did not directly or experimentally examine the causes of the observed zonation pattern of mangrove species. We may postulate that it is driven by the different resource availability or the soil het-erogeneity from the upland to the sea. The comparable zonation of mangrove species between planted and natural mangroves indirectly supports the assumption that propagule availability cannot account for the zonation of mangrove species (McKee 1995;Sousa and Mitchell 1999;Sousa et al. 2007). Because of the great economic and ecological value of mangrove forests (Barbier et al. 2008;Han et al. 2000), plantations have become one of the most important ways for the restoration of this threatened forest type in the tropical and subtropical coastal regions. Whether this artificially created ecosystem can serve the same ecological role (e.g. resistance to disturbance, carbon fixation and biodiversity conservation) as the natural ecosystems largely depends on its structure and function. Although there are greater variations in the attributes of planted mangrove stand than of the natural mangrove stand, our results indicate that at age 50, the planted mangroves are comparable in stand structure, species association, and AGB to the natural mangroves.",

Moreover, forest ecosystems play an irreplaceable role in regulating the carbon balance, mitigating greenhouse gas concentrations, such as carbon dioxide, and maintaining global climates. In recent years, the vegetation carbon balance has been investigated in China, especially the carbon sink of forests.

In the spatial distribution of biomass in forest ecosystems, there are differences between young and mature forests. In general, biomass of the tree layer of young forests is lower, while that of mature forests is higher. The spatial distribution of biomass is affected by different stages of succession. Carbon biomass of the tree layer in early succession stages is lower than that in late succession stages (Kimmins, 2004). The results indicate that the tree layer played the most important role in the biomass of the P. bournei plantation. The total biomass of forest stands was 174.33 t/hm 2 , where the tree layer, with 166.73 t/hm 2 , accounted for 95.6%.

Ranking of the spatial distribution of carbon storage was as follows: soil layer (0-80 cm) > tree layer > herbal layer > litter layer > lichen layer > shrub layer.

Mitigation practices that reduce available nitrogen may ameliorate this problem. We evaluated the effects of tree removal followed by soil preparation or mulching on native plant growth and soil nitrogen transformations in a pine-oak system formerly occupied by exotic nitrogenfixing Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) trees. Greenhouse growth experiments with native grasses, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, showed elevated relative growth rates in soils from Black locust compared with pine-oak stands. Field soil nutrient concentrations and rates of net nitrification and total net N-mineralization were compared 2 and 4 years since Black locust removal and in control sites. Although soil nitrogen concentrations and total net N-mineralization rates in the restored sites were reduced to levels that were similar to paired pine-oak stands after only 2 years, net nitrification rates remained 3-34 times higher in the restored sites. Other nutrient ion concentrations (Ca, Mg) and organic matter content were reduced, whereas phosphorus levels remained elevated in restored sites. Thus, 2-4 years following Black locust tree removal and soil horizon mixing achieved through site preparation, the concentrations of many soil nutrients returned to preinvasion levels. However, net nitrification rates remained elevated; cover cropping or carbon addition during restoration of sites invaded by nitrogen fixers could increase nitrogen immobilization and/or reduce nitrate availability, making sites more amenable to native plant establishment.",

Nitrogen-fixing plants increase soil nitrogen concentrations and rates of nitrogen cycling by producing nitrogenrich litter that mineralizes rapidly (Vitousek & Walker 1989;Witkowski 1991;Stock et al. 1995;Yelenik et al. 2004). Nitrogen inputs in nutrient-poor habitats can greatly alter growth and community dynamics (Vitousek & Walker 1989;Berendse & Elberse 1990;Peloquin & Hiebert 1999;Evans et al. 2001;Tilman & Lehman 2001), causing species displacement. In addition, exotic nitrogenfixing plants can facilitate invasion by other non-native plant species (Hobbs & Huenneke 1992;Maron & Connors 1996;Mack & D'Antonio 1998), and nitrogen enrichment may lead to reductions in species diversity (Gough & Marrs 1990;Peloquin & Hiebert 1999;Suding et al. 2005). Consequently, invasive nitrogen-fixing plants complicate reserve management. Restoration efforts in sites previously occupied by nitrogen fixers have had limited success (Averett et al. 2004), possibly due to elevated nitrogen availability, which promotes rapid establishment of fast-growing, and often exotic, species. For example, after the death of the invasive nitrogen-fixing shrub, Yellow bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), from a coastal prairie habitat in central California, elevated concentrations of NH 4 1 and NO 3 2 remained in the soil. Many non-native species established on these sites rather than the diverse stand of native perennial grasses and annual forbs (Maron & Connors 1996).",

Once established, Black locust can add up to 75 kg N ha 21 yr 21 (Boring & Swank 1984). When Black locust invades nutrient-poor sites, it increases nitrogen return in litter fall, elevates nitrogen mineralization rates, and supplements soil nitrogen pools (Montagnini et al. 1986(Montagnini et al. , 1991;;Rice et al. 2004). Black locust invasion can also lower plant species diversity, facilitate the spread of other non-native plant species, alter the light environment, and influence plant community composition (Boring & Swank 1984;Peloquin & Hiebert 1999;Matus et al. 2003). The ability of Black locust to sprout from roots makes its removal difficult. Extraction of Black locust by felling followed by mechanically removing stumps and roots has shown short-term success (N. Gifford 2005, Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission, Albany, NY, U.S.A., personal communication). Even when Black locust removal is successful, elevated levels of soil nitrogen may remain, potentially influencing native plant community restoration. It is widely recognized that fertilization impacts community structure and successional patterns, largely by influencing patterns of growth and competitive interactions (Tilman 1986;Tilman & Wedin 1991;Wilson & Tilman 1993;Wedin & Tilman 1996).",

Few studies (e.g., Maron & Jefferies 2001) have explored the temporal response of nitrogen dynamics in a formerly nutrient-poor ecosystem after the removal of a nitrogen-fixing species. A globally rare Pitch Pine-Scrub Oak Barrens community type in New York State, United States, has suffered from invasion by Black locust. Like other upland ecosystems that formed on sand dunes characterized by highlight and nutrient-poor soils (Peloquin & Hiebert 1999;Matus et al. 2003), invasion by Black locust threatens this pine-oak community. Compared to the native sites, Black locust stands have 1.3-3.2 times greater soil nitrogen concentrations, 4.5 times greater nitrogen in leaf litter, and 30 to over 150 times higher rates of net nitrification (Rice et al. 2004). Restoration efforts in this community began by removing stands of Black locust in 2000; these sites were also seeded with native forb and grass species. This effort met with varied initial success, as some sites became dominated by non-native species and perennial grasses with little cover of diverse forb species. Residual nitrogen in the soil at restored Black locust sites may have enhanced the competitive vigor of grasses and weedy species, while simultaneously reducing the competitiveness of native forbs. These restoration plots correspond with those surveyed in a previous study of soil nitrogen transformations (Rice et al. 2004) and provide an opportunity to evaluate the temporal response of soil nitrogen dynamics following removal of a nitrogen-fixing tree. Our specific objectives were to (1) determine the effects of Black locust, restoration and soil carbon addition on native plant growth using two species of native grasses and (2) examine the time course of soil nutrient concentrations and nitrogen transformation rates following removal of Black locust and planting of native species.",

When grown in soil from the restoration stand where Black locust had been removed, grasses displayed RGRs that were intermediate between and not different from either Black locust or pine-oak soils. Thus, restoration reduced plant growth to levels that did not differ from those found in the native pine-oak environment. The N-transformation and nutrient analyses in our study showed that net nitrification rates remained elevated in the restored soil, although it was significantly reduced. Such a reduction of plant available nitrogen has led to increased diversity in restored grasslands (Hobbs & Atkins 1988;Gough & Marrs 1990;Baer et al. 2003). Unfortunately, this reduction may not be sufficient at our site because the initial restoration led to early dominance by native perennial grasses, which quickly established dense stands thereby excluding target forb species. Thus, even though restoration succeeded in reducing soil fertility, even in the first year following treatment, further acceleration of nitrogen immobilization or ecosystem nitrogen loss may facilitate restoration efforts (see Management Implications below). Invasion by Back locust in the present study elevated soil P, Ca, and Mg. This pattern has also been observed under Black locust in North Carolina (Montagnini et al. 1986(Montagnini et al. , 1991) ) and beneath nitrogen-fixing Acacia species in South Africa (Witkowski 1991). Few studies have investigated the resultant changes in nutrient availability following restoration. One study in former agriculture fields that had not been fertilized for between 3 and 25 years suggested that N, P, and K concentrations in plant tissues decreased over time (Pegtel et al. 1996). In our study, most of the major macronutrients (K, Ca, Mg) in the restored Black locust plots significantly decreased to nearpreinvasion levels in the 2 and 4 years that passed after restoration in at least one of the sites.",
        "18b533c0-de5d-45d5-b4cc-498c87009de2": "In addition, other sites showed similar, yet nonsignificant, trends. The control site showed no similar decreases in these same soil nutrients. In contrast, P levels did not change in any significant way between 2000 and 2004 in any of the stands or sites. Gough and Marrs (1990) stress that it may be necessary to reduce levels of P in soils before species-rich grasslands can be successfully established and maintained on old field sites, especially abandoned agricultural fields. In three of four study sites, P was elevated in the Black locust stands but did not significantly decrease following restoration. In contrast, plant growth did decrease, suggesting that the elevated P levels were not directly responsible for changes in soil fertility at these sites. High inputs of nitrogen can be devastating to plant community function and composition (Hobbs & Huenneke 1992). We found that nitrogen content and total net N-mineralization rates decreased in restored Black locust plots to levels found in pine-oak sites after 2-4 years had passed since tree removal. However, although net nitrification rates were significantly reduced in all restored stands, rates remained elevated relative to non-invaded sites. Removing Black locust trees immediately eliminates a rapidly mineralizable source of nitrogen to soils. Rice et al. (2004) found that Black locust adds up to 94 kg N ha 21 yr 21 in leaf litter alone in the study area. This litter has low C:N ratio and lignin content relative to the native trees and shrubs and rapidly decomposes. Although tree removal reduces the pool of nitrogen available to soil microbes and returns total net N-mineralization rates to levels not different from pine-oak soils, rates of net nitrification remain high. This suggests that the processes that control nitrification in the restoration stands remain different from those found in pine-oak sites. In pine-oak soils, mineralized nitrogen is mainly present as ammonium (Rice et al. 2004), suggesting that nitrification is not limited by the substrate but that the process is inhibited.",
        "facb48dd-0de5-4a9c-9e0d-18f47e988196": "Soils in Pinus sylvestris stands have lower microbial biomass and enzyme levels responsible for organic carbon and nitrogen mineralization than Black locust stands (Landgraf et al. 2005), which likely contributes to this difference. Also, although it has not been investigated in pine barrens soils, tannins and other compounds in pine and oak litter inhibit nitrification (Rice & Pancholy 1973;Lodi & Killingbeck 1980;Schimel et al. 1998;Kraus et al. 2003). During restoration, high microbial activity with reduced inhibition of mineralization processes may follow scrub oak and Pitch pine establishment and be required to reduce nitrification to preinvasion levels in this ecosystem. One consequence of high nitrification rates in restored stands is that it may lead to continued ecosystem loss of nitrogen through leaching because nitrate is more mobile in soils than ammonium.",

Consequently, we aimed to determine for the first time the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in a southern-hemisphere dry sclerophyll ecosystem. We investigated the impact of species richness on productivity, plant density and mean plant biomass at three sowing densities in three species assemblages. Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata were each grown as monocultures and included in every subsequent level of species richness, forming three distinct species assemblages. Communities were grown in a glasshouse pot experiment for four months, then harvested and above-ground biomass measured. We found no general species richness-productivity relationship in the communities studied.There were no overall increases in productivity as species richness increased and in fact in most cases the productivity of communities with 4 and 8 species was lower than monocultures of the dominants. Importantly, density influenced the way richness affected productivity and this effect was dependent upon assemblage, indicating that species identity is a key determinant of productivity.These results demonstrate important ecological principles in a previously untested system. A key outcome of this experiment is that density alters the relationship between species richness and initial productivity in assemblages of Australian dry sclerophyll species.",
        "4314a753-146d-49b9-bdb8-3825ae55014c": "The apparent positive relationship between the species richness of a community and its productivity has received much attention (Flombaum & Sala 2008;P\u00e4rtel et al. 2010;Strong 2010) and has important ramifications for ecosystem carbon sequestration (Hulvey et al. 2013). Biodiversity experiments that manipulate plant species richness generally show a positive relationship between richness and productivity (Tilman et al. 1997(Tilman et al. , 2001;;Loreau & Hector 2001;Hooper et al. 2005;Marquard et al. 2009), although some show no relationship (Hooper & Vitousek 1997;Huston et al. 2000;Aarssen 2001), while a few have demonstrated negative effects (Hunt et al. 1999;Balvanera et al. 2006). Although there is debate regarding the mechanistic causes of the commonly seen relationship (Hector 1998;Loreau & Hector 2001), two mechanisms have been identified as being most likely: complementarity and selection effects (Stachov\u00e1 et al. 2012). If the productivity of a system is primarily determined by one or a few species, then increasing species richness increases the chance that those species will be present.This is known as the selection effect and is a simple probabilistic phenomenon (Hector 1998). Alternatively, when co-occurring plant species differ in the way they use resources, increasing plant species richness may increase productivity via complementary resource use (Cardinale et al. 2007). Where functionally dissimilar species co-occur, niche partitioning and facilitation will lead to complementarity, thereby increasing overall productivity (Mouquet et al. 2002). In such situations, community biomass reaches a level greater than the average biomass of monocultures of the constituent species and overyielding is said to have occurred (Hector 1998;Tilman 1999). Selection effects and complementarity are often considered to be alternative mechanisms that account for positive species richness-productivity relationships.",
        "6318da44-272b-4bd8-9740-1db3188efc66": "They may operate simultaneously as higher diversity allows for both the possibility of selecting one dominant highly productive species and a suite of complementary species (Loreau et al. 2001). There is a well-known relationship between density and productivity, in which productivity increases with increasing plant density to an asymptote (Weiner & Freckleton 2010). In species richness-productivity experiments, density has traditionally been kept constant (e.g. Hector et al. 1999). Despite the fact that plant communities can have higher density than monocultures of the component species (Marquard et al. 2009;Guo 2011), the role of community density in the species richness-productivity relationship has been largely ignored (Dekker et al. 2008). Only a few studies have explicitly considered density (e.g. Marquard et al. 2009), and even fewer have manipulated it to test its impact on the species richnessproductivity relationship (He et al. 2005;Li et al. 2011;Stachov\u00e1 et al. 2012) . Rarely have experiments been designed to determine how plant density contributes to the species richness-productivity relationship (He et al. 2005;Li et al. 2011), despite indications that density could play an important role (Marquard et al. 2009;Stachov\u00e1 et al. 2012). Monocultures of the most productive species in a community could produce greater biomass than species mixtures which dilute the contribution of a dominant species (Hunt et al. 1999). This idea has been investigated in grasslands (Sasaki & Lauenroth 2011), where production of dominant species alone, rather than diverse communities, resulted in increases in community biomass. The contrasting view is that increasing species richness compensates for a reduction in productivity caused by the reduced density of a dominant species (Hulvey et al. 2013). Few studies have investigated the species richness effect in the Australian eucalypt forest system.",
        "1f07317f-c6b0-4746-bf8b-724b21530ac8": "Few studies have investigated the species richness effect in the Australian eucalypt forest system. Since the large majority of the biomass in these forests comes from one or very few large species of Eucalyptus (Specht 1970), it is believed that increases in species richness may lead to a reduction in productivity through a dilution of the contribution of the dominant species (Hunt et al. 1999(Hunt et al. , 2006;;Forrester et al. 2007). For example, Hunt et al. (2006) found that Eucalyptus nitens and Acacia dealbata competed strongly in the initial stages of growth, and hence monocultures of E. nitens were more productive than a community containing both species. This is especially important since this speciespairing should be complementary, as A. dealbata is both N-fixing and shade-tolerant (Austin et al. 1997;Reid et al. 2005). Clearly, the relationship between species richness and productivity needs to be investigated more thoroughly in this system. Much effort across the globe is expended on both environmental restoration and carbon-offset plantings. While carbon-offset plantings are often monocultures, there is great potential for such schemes to address conservation goals by planting species mixtures, thereby providing biodiversity benefits in addition to carbon sequestration (Stier & Siebert 2002;Hatanaka et al. 2011).There is recent evidence that tree mixtures can sequester as much carbon as monocultures of the most productive species (Hulvey et al. 2013), but evidence for this from Australia is scarce. Therefore, it is important to understand whether incorporating a biodiverse component to Australian carbon-offset plantings reduces productivity and hence the carbonoffset potential of these plantations (Omeja et al. 2011). Here, we examine the effect of species richness and sowing density on the initial productivity of dry sclerophyll communities from south-eastern Tasmania using a glasshouse trial.",

Repeated fires promote the dominance of Eucalyptus or Acacia spp. whereas Allocasuarina verticillata increases in dominance in the absence of fire. These three species are functionally different, varying in growth rate and having different impacts on ecosystem processes including competitive relationships with co-occurring species (Reid et al. 2005). Therefore, it is possible that the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship will differ among assemblages of species that are dominated by each of these species types.We tested species richness and sowing density effects in three assemblages, each dominated by one of these three species types in order to determine whether the nature of the target dominant species influenced the species richness-productivity relationship. Therefore, the aims of this experiment were: \u2022 To determine whether increasing species richness increases initial productivity in dry sclerophyll forest species of south-eastern Australia. \u2022 To determine whether sowing density affects the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in this system. \u2022 To determine whether these relationships vary according to plant assemblage.",
        "02b75208-fcb7-4c3d-aead-661d82125fd7": "The aim of this study was to determine whether sowing density influenced the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in the early growth of an Australian forest system.While many experimental studies have demonstrated clear positive relationships between species richness and productivity (Naeem et al. 1994;Tilman et al. 1997;Hector et al. 1999;Balvanera et al. 2006;Cardinale et al. 2007), both over the long and short term, our results demonstrated that the relationship is highly dependent upon sowing density and the particular species involved. Therefore, results of this study emphasized that the species richness-productivity relationship needs to be viewed in the context of plant density. This confirmed the work of a growing number of studies that have found community density to influence the relationship between species diversity and productivity (He et al. 2005;Marquard et al. 2009;Stachov\u00e1 et al. 2012). We also tested the impact of increasing species richness of a community that already contains a dominant species, employing a realistic experimental design, given the likelihood that dominant species will persist for the longest in a community facing species loss (Smith & Knapp 2003;Isbell et al. 2013). Our results demonstrated that at low levels of diversity, increasing species richness reduced overall productivity but productivity increased at higher levels of diversity, and importantly, these trends could be negated if community density was sufficiently high. In order to determine whether the nature of the dominant species was important in shaping the species richness-productivity relationship, we tested three assemblages with functionally different dominant species; a Eucalyptus, an Acacia, and an Allocasuarina. Effects from both richness and density differed among assemblages, with none of the three assemblages tested here showing a consistently positive impact of species richness on productivity. However, as species were lost from the highest level of diversity, there was a negative relationship between species richness and productivity but again this trend depended upon density.",
        "9c47ca99-b7b0-4a4f-83fa-78a6341f1587": "Increases in productivity as a result of increasing species richness were found when species richness increased from 8 to 15 species at most densities in assemblages with target dominants Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata. It would appear that this increase was related most strongly to the inclusion of one or two highly productive species, as opposed to increases in species richness per se. These results contrasted with a large portion of published literature regarding diversity-productivity relationships (Di\u00e1z & Cabido 2001;Loreau & Hector 2001;Tilman et al. 2001), which argue for a positive effect of diversity on productivity. The different responses of the assemblages observed here indicate that species identity has an important influence on ecosystem function, confirming the findings of Li et al. (2011) who demonstrated that species composition influenced community productivity significantly. In fact, composition has been found to be a greater determinant of ecosystem process than species number and particular species can explain a substantial proportion of variation in community biomass (Hooper & Vitousek 1997;Tilman et al. 1997;\u0160pa\u00e8kov\u00e1 & Lep\u0161 2001). Thus, the traits of one or a few species in a community may dominate (Sasaki & Lauenroth 2011), such as observed in this study. Cassinia aculeata, which was only included at the highest richness level, contributed greatly to the high biomass of the communities with 15 species therefore providing a clear example of selection effects on productivity. Similarly, the impact on productivity of diluting the dominant species, by increasing species richness while holding density constant, particularly in assemblages B and C, indicated strongly that dominant species controlled initial productivity. Other studies have also found that variation in ecosystem properties is related to difference in functional characteristics of dominant plants and claimed there was no convincing evidence that ecosystem processes are dependent upon high levels of biodiversity (Grime 1997;Hooper & Vitousek 1997).",
        "b9983768-d340-48c7-8491-c0d94bdc4198": "Our results demonstrated that productivity was highest when a particularly dominant species, such as Eucalyptus globulus or C. aculeata, was included in a mixture, supporting this contention. Our results showed that increases in biomass associated with changes in species richness corresponded to increases in plant size, but little change in the total number of plants. However, this was strongly dependent upon the level of sown density.We have also shown density to prevent a decline in productivity as species are lost from a system. These results contrast with those of Marquard et al. (2009) who found that increased productivity at higher richness levels was associated with increased plant density but the size of the plants was constant. As density was not varied in their experimental design, their results indicate that survivorship increased with increasing species richness, emphasizing the different impacts of inter-and intra-specific competition. In addition, our experiment revealed a compensatory effect of sown density, similar to that demonstrated by He et al. (2005), who also included a specific density treatment in their study and found high density to compensate for low levels of species richness. Where He et al. (2005) found increases in biomass as richness increased, and even higher biomass when grown at high density, our results showed that reductions in biomass with increasing species richness did not occur at high density. Thus, high community density can prevent declines in productivity if diversity is lost. Further to this, density had some impact on preventing a decline in productivity from dilution of the dominant species. Sufficient numbers of the dominant present in assemblage A allowed E. globulus to maintain productivity of the whole community as their own density decreased with increasing species richness.Total biomass of E. globulus did not respond to species richness in assemblage A (data not shown), so the individual E. globulus seedlings were larger at lower population density. Thus, growth of E. globulus individuals was dependent upon population density and not community density and, hence, productivity was maintained by high density across all species richness levels.",
        "8611672b-cbc5-4167-b56b-f818883742f8": "In contrast, in assemblages B and C, increasing species richness led to a reduction in the total biomass of the dominant species and, in most cases, it was replaced with a less productive species, thereby reducing community biomass. Although we have determined the selection effect as a mechanistic explanation for the changes in biomass seen here, it is likely that other diversity effects may occur in the same communities under a different set of conditions. It has been suggested that in a more heterogeneous environment productivity will increase from both selection effects and complementarity; when a habitat is heterogeneous, a diverse community will use the habitat more efficiently than a single species will (Mouquet et al. 2002). As this was a glasshouse pot experiment, there was low environmental heterogeneity, both spatially and temporally, and this might explain the lack of complementarity observed here. A long-term observational study in the field would be complementary to any further synthetically assembled experiments, given the limited possibilities of short-term experiments in unveiling a comprehensive understanding of how diversity effects may change over time (Reich et al. 2012). Considering that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem processes is thought to strengthen over time (Hector et al. 2007), a longer term experiment may have found different results. It is predicted that selection effects are important initially, but that the mechanisms driving increasing productivity can change and the importance of complementarity effects increase over time (Cardinale et al. 2007;Li et al. 2011). This is unlikely in this system though, considering that work done in Eucalyptus forests from a longer set of observations (8 years) found similar results to our study, i.e. higher productivity of a site when species were present in a monoculture (Hunt et al. 1999). This would seem to be uncharacteristic, however, as a recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that in general, species mixtures are at least as productive as monocultures of their most productive component species (Hulvey et al. 2013).",

Although our focus has been on the functional traits of the most dominant organisms as they have the most impact in regulating ecosystem properties, it is also believed that relatively rare or low total biomass species can have large effects that may be seen over time (Yachi & Loreau 1999;Reich et al. 2012). This indicates that the effect of biodiversity in natural systems may be larger than currently thought (Flombaum & Sala 2008). This study has demonstrated that species richnessproductivity relationships are not universal, as there was no overall effect of increasing species richness on community biomass, at least in the initial growth period. While it is possible that the nature of this experiment, being a relatively short-term glasshouse trial with nutrients and water in abundant supply, reduced any effects of species richness on productivity, other similar studies have shown clear relationships between these factors. Also, the fact that density significantly influenced the species richness-productivity relationship and that the three assemblages reacted differently indicated that these factors were important influences on the nature of the relationship, as has been suggested previously (He et al. 2005;Marquard et al. 2009;Li et al. 2011). In this experiment, richness effects were dependent upon the composition of species, demonstrating that species identity was important and that the dominant species were key determinants of productivity. This conforms to a view held by many (e.g. Grime 1997;Hooper & Vitousek 1997), that the functional traits of particular species may drive productivity. The patterns revealed in this study were species-specific, as they were dependent upon the plant assemblage, and in the few instances where an increase in species richness led to an increase in productivity, it was dependent upon the contribution to biomass of a few highly productive species. These results must be viewed in the context of the realistic experimental design of this study; with an initial level of productivity based on that of a dominant forest species, the addition of other species does little to bolster productivity (Smith & Knapp 2003).",

However, this study was not able to assess the impor-tance of changes in diversity over time; so it is possible that positive species richness-productivity relationships may have emerged in the longer term (Isbell et al. 2009(Isbell et al. , 2011)). Future field-based long-term investigations might demonstrate the importance of temporal variation in this relationship. We also demonstrated that density had substantial impacts on productivity, and influenced the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in every assemblage of species. Communities that had low biomass at higher species richness achieved higher levels of productivity when planted at higher densities. Therefore, density had a compensatory effect at low richness.We believe this design contributes an alternative methodology useful for revealing the extent of species richness-productivity relationships in forest ecosystems, where mixtures assembled by random selection from a species pool that may not contain a dominant are not sufficient to capture the realities of forest structure.These results have for the first time, in a system previously unstudied, demonstrated that the species richness-productivity relationship is not universally positive, and density must be considered in order to fully understand and predict the behaviour of a plant community.",

Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics, and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.",

Climate mitigation is imperative to limit climate change and reduce its negative impacts on nature and humans (IPCC 2018). Reduction of climate-related risks depends upon efforts such as the Paris Agreement that aim to limit global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C, striving for 1.5 \u00b0C in relation to pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC 2015a; Manes et al. 2021;Warren et al. 2018). To achieve such goal, mitigation pathways cannot merely rely on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but also extensively promote carbon sequestration on land (Mackey et al. 2020;IPCC 2019). The protection of primary forests and efforts to recover degraded land through reforestations are indispensable to achieve such climatic stability (Grassi et al. 2017;Griscom et al. 2017). The need for reforestation is clear. Precisely, recent estimations suggest that current forested land would need to double in order to meet the 2 \u00b0C goal (Mader 2020) and reforestation of 1 billion hectares by 2050 to achieve the 1.5 \u00b0C goal (IPCC 2018), which has been indicated as an achievable target (Bastin et al. 2019). The great number of reforestation initiatives around the world reflects the international awareness towards the urgency of climate mitigation (Bustamante et al. 2019) (e.g. the Bonn Challenge, United Nations decade on ecosystem restoration, \"trillion trees by 2050\" goal from Plant for the Planet). In fact, two-thirds of countries' pledges on nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement explicitly mention such nature-based solutions as pathways to achieve this goal (Seddon et al. 2019(Seddon et al. , 2020)), especially nations with pronounced deforestation trends (Bustamante et al. 2019).",

Indeed, the greatest potential for reforestation is within such tropical less-developed nations with large forests (Brancalion et al. 2019;Bustamante et al. 2019). Brazil is one of the countries with the greatest reforestation potential in the tropics (Bastin et al. 2019). Brazilian intended nationally determined contributions include the reforestation of 12 million hectares of forests until 2030, in accordance with the national adaptation plan (iNDC-Brazil 2015). Indeed, it is the tropical country with the largest restoration-hotspot area (i.e. areas that can maximize benefits and feasibility of restoration), especially due to the Atlantic Forest (Brancalion et al. 2019). The Atlantic Forest has been severely deforested, reducing the biome to small forest remnants and fragmented landscapes (Ribeiro et al. 2009). However, reforestation initiatives, such as The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact, which aim to reforest 15 million hectares by 2050, have the potential to restore its forests concomitantly promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation (Crouzeilles et al. 2019;Scarano and Ceotto 2015;Vale et al. 2021;Pires et al. 2017). Reforestation debts in the Atlantic Forest in accordance to the national Forest Code would correspond to approximately half of Brazilian reforestation commitments to the Paris Agreement (Rezende et al. 2018). Thus, the Atlantic Forest has extensive reforestation potential, and efforts to reach mitigation goals are ongoing. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact has already recovered more than 1 million hectares of degraded forests (Crouzeilles et al. 2019).

To offset current human footprint on nature, ongoing extensive reforestation initiatives are needed, especially in tropical forests such as the Atlantic Forest. We demonstrate that these reforestations have great potential for carbon sequestration and provide valuable contributions to mitigation of unchecked climate change. Young reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates compared to un-assisted natural regeneration and oldgrowth forests. We found far greater potential in forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. The Atlantic Forest is the biome with the most number of studies on reforestations and ecological restorations in the country (Guerra et al. 2020). However, such studies focus on the effectiveness of reforestation initiatives but often disregard their carbon sequestration potential. We found few studies that evaluated biomass or carbon stocks in reforestations, and these were limited to those of young age. We reveal a great potential of sequestration in reforestation under initial ages, but such shortage of studies impairs a more detailed  estimation of how these rates could change in later ages. Hence, further studies are indispensable to enhance the predictive ability of carbon mitigation potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations under later successional stages. The literature on carbon sequestration in the Atlantic Forest is biassed towards estimations of un-assisted natural regeneration and oldgrowth forest remnants across a range of different ages. A recent assessment of the literature also corroborates our findings that the majority of studies assess Atlantic Forest reforestations of less than 10 years old, and estimations are scarcer within older ages (Guerra et al. 2020). The literature on reforestations range between 1-and 60-year-old forests, whereas un-assisted natural regeneration remnants go up to 120-year-old (Guerra et al. 2020).

First, the time elapsed since the implementation of a reforestation drives its effectiveness; thus, time is among the most important determinants of reforestation success (Crouzeilles et al. 2016). Second, carbon stock in a forest is a function of tree growth through time, enhancing carbon accumulation due to increases in tree size and biomass (Silveira et al. 2008). However, although older forests have larger amounts of carbon stored due to size and time, we demonstrate that reforestations have the highest sequestration rates. The biomass stock estimations from REGUA doubled between reforestation of 3 and 10 years old, and by 13 years old, they had almost half the biomass of 60-yearold ones. Indeed, average estimations from Atlantic Forest reforestations within protected areas match mean values of protected natural regenerations in medium succession stages and unprotected ones in advanced succession stages, amounting to almost half the stock of protected old-growth forests. Such great potential of these reforestations from a young age brings hope to the achievement of ambitious mitigation goals. In fact, it has been suggested that the rate of sequestration from young Neotropical reforestations (< 20 years old) is 11 times greater than rates from mature forests (Poorter et al. 2016). Without the contributions from such reforestations, global carbon concentration in the atmosphere would be at least 30% higher (Yang et al. 2010). Such higher potential of young reforestations is associated with a higher proportion of fast-growing species that can accumulate more carbon in the early years of reforestation (< 37 years old), whereas slow-growing species contribute more towards later succession stages (Shimamoto et al. 2014;Silveira et al. 2008). Thus, benefits from Atlantic Forest reforestations can increase exponentially during initial years (Shimamoto et al. 2014). Although the reforestations grant the greatest carbon mitigation potential, natural regeneration of Atlantic Forest remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation.",
        "b0c7ea78-c7e5-4b0b-a57b-18b58e4a7c0e": "Reforestations are highly costly undertakings (~ US$4,000 per hectare; Benini et al. 2017), so there is great advantage in concomitantly increasing the potential of cost-effective natural regeneration (Crouzeilles et al. 2020). The identification of priority areas for both reforestation and natural regeneration could maximize benefits and reduce its costs of implementations (Di Sacco et al. 2021;Strassburg et al. 2019), especially because some areas might present unfavourable conditions for such strategies (e.g. severe soil degradation, areas with difficult access such as steep slopes; Benini et al. 2017). Noteworthy, the proximity of abandoned forests with other forest fragments can assist dispersal and buffer degradation, accelerating recovery and speeding rates of growth, as well as essential ecological interactions (Rodrigues et al. 2009). Thus, implementing reforestations near abandoned forests undergoing un-assisted natural regeneration can be an interesting strategy to increase carbon sequestration in both. In the Atlantic Forest, natural regeneration is a valuable strategy alongside reforestations to contribute to the achievement of restoration and mitigation targets (Rezende et al. 2018;Strassburg et al. 2016). Recent estimations indicate that 2.72 million hectares of the Atlantic Forest has been recovered through natural regeneration and that this amount could double until 2035 (Crouzeilles et al. 2020). Reforestation and natural regeneration have pronounced roles in carbon sequestration in the Atlantic Forest. However, the biome's historical deforestation trends have not ceased yet (Scarano and Ceotto 2015). The Atlantic Forest is losing large amounts of carbon due to deforestation, fragmentation, selective logging and edge effects (P\u00fctz et al 2014;Maxwell et al. 2019). Thus, protected areas are indispensable buffers of human footprint and global changes, especially regarding the effects of land-use change (Watson et al. 2014;Vaz et al. 2021). Although protected areas are not exempt of deforestation, they significantly reduce its magnitude (Vaz et al. 2021).",
        "de5c2a8f-e240-4d8c-9ee9-b1b566efd592": "2021). We found higher carbon sequestration for all types of forest fragments within protected areas than for unprotected sites. Reforestations' stock was 26% higher, and natural regeneration's stock was 48% higher inside protected areas than outside. Although reforestations do not hold the same benefits for biodiversity as primary forests (Gibson et al. 2011), they are extremely needed to offset current deforestation trends in the Atlantic Forest and have earth-shattering contributions to mitigation of global climate change (Manes et al. 2022). Reforestations are able to recover many components of biodiversity and ecosystem services lost because of land conversion and degradation (Chazdon 2008;Crouzeilles et al. 2016;Benayas et al. 2009). Associated co-benefits of recovering forests beyond carbon sequestration have already been identified in the Atlantic Forest (Matos et al. 2020). A recent study estimated that recovering forests were able to produce 20% of carbon sequestration, concomitantly increasing > 75% of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity in comparison to values found in primary forests (Matos et al. 2020). Climate change is projected to be an additional source of pressure on ecosystems, even potentially compromising carbon sequestration itself (Zhao et al. 2020). Thus, climate action is urgent. Ambitious efforts must be taken to meet the large-scale forest restoration goals from the international agenda (Holl 2017) and towards limiting unchecked 1 3 climate change. The Atlantic Forest has indispensable contributions to achieving both of these goals.",

The small extent and high biodiversity of indigenous forests in South Africa make them particularly important. Yet, relatively little is known about their rates of use and change. From analysis of past aerial photos we quantified rates of forest cover change in the Matiwane forests of the Wild Coast, South Africa, between 1942 and 2007, as well as quantified above-and belowground (to 0.5 m depth) carbon stocks based on a composite allometric equation derived for the area. Rates of forest conversion were spatially variable, with some areas showing no change and others more noticeable changes. Overall, the net reduction was 5.2% (0.08% p.a.) over the 65-year period. However, the rate of reduction has accelerated with time. Some of the reduction was balanced by natural reforestation into formerly cleared areas, but basal area, biomass and carbon stocks are still low in the reforested areas. The total carbon stock was highest in intact forests (311.7 \u00b1 23.7 Mg C ha -1 ), followed by degraded forests (73.5 \u00b1 12.3 Mg C ha -1 ) and least in regrowth forests (51.2 \u00b1 6.2 Mg C ha -1 ). The greatest contribution to total carbon stocks was soil carbon, contributing 54% in intact forests, and 78% and 68% in degraded and regrowth forests, respectively. The Matiwane forests store 4.78 Tg C, with 4.7 Tg C in intact forests, 0.06 Tg C in degraded forests and 0.02 Tg C in regrowth forests. The decrease in carbon stocks within the forests as a result of the conversion of the forest area to agricultural fields was 0.19 Tg C and approximately 0.0003 Tg C was released through harvesting of firewood and building timber.",

The majority of indigenous forests occur in the Eastern Cape province, with a considerable proportion along the Wild Coast. There are approximately 50 000 ha of indigenous forest along the Wild Coast, largely made up of numerous fragments smaller than 100 ha within a grassland matrix (Rutherford et al. 2006;Berliner 2011). This forms part of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot characterised by high species richness and endemism (CEPF 2011) and consequently there is much interest and responsibility to ensure that forests in the region are in good health and are used sustainably. In common with savannas and forests elsewhere in the country, the Wild Coast forests have been, and continue to be, shaped by local people in pursuit of their livelihoods (Wigley et al. 2010;Shackleton et al. 2013). There are several human-mediated local-level pressures affecting the structure, composition and functioning of the forests. First is the clearance of forests to create arable fields and to a lesser extent built infrastructure. The second is the cutting and harvesting of timber and non-timber forest products from the forests to provide a wide array of livelihood needs (Timmermans 2004;Shackleton et al. 2007). Third is the extensive use of fire as a management tool in the surrounding grasslands (Kepe 2005), but which also may burn forest fringes and, if intense, at times burn into forest. Fourth, livestock are an important part of the local culture, identity and economy (de Klerk 2007) and their browsing and grazing pressures can influence forest structure and hinder recruitment of some forest species. Lastly, in the last few decades, several invasive alien species have proliferated in the region (Berliner 2011), with undoubted, albeit little studied, impacts on forest dynamics and composition (e.g.",
        "bf608575-7b0b-456b-9e46-1e1a427d47d4": "Jevon and Shackleton 2015). Cognisant of these anthropogenic pressures and an increasing human population, the health and sustainability of the Wild Coast forests have been debated for some time. Rates of loss through clearing of forest to arable fields have, on the one hand, been mooted as excessive, certainly in the past, but on the other hand large areas of forest regrowth have been reported by the likes of Chalmers and Fabricius (2007), de Klerk (2007) and Shackleton et al. (2013). Some have argued that such regrowth is largely acacia invasion into grasslands and that it rarely progresses towards a greater species mix and biomass in comparison to indigenous forest (e.g. Berliner 2011). However, Shackleton et al. (2013) recently dispelled this argument, showing accumulation rates of approximately three woody species per decade after abandonment of former arable fields and basal area increments averaging 0.34 m 2 decade -1 . The rate of forest succession depends upon the duration of the previous cultivation and once the field has been abandoned, the frequency and intensity of disturbances such as fire, harvesting and browsing. Debate about the extent of forest reduction in this region have been largely at the local scale and driven by concerns about biodiversity loss. Internationally, interest in forest loss (or gain) is driven also by climate change concerns regarding the gains or loss of carbon through different land uses and land-use changes. Given their high biomass per unit area, forests store a considerable proportion of the world's terrestrial carbon (Back\u00e9us et al. 2005), and significant changes in forest biomass can affect atmospheric carbon levels. For example, during the period 2000-2005 approximately 4 million ha of forest was transformed annually in sub-Saharan Africa, with the conversion of forests to agricultural lands being the main contributor (approximately 59%) to such loss (FAO 2007). This forest conversion resulted in 0.29 Pg C y -1 of carbon emissions from Africa alone (Shvidenko 2008).",

Nonetheless, Rahlao et al. (2012) argue that there is considerable scope for South Africa to participate in REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation). However, initial steps require detailed forest inventories of carbon stocks, as well as mapping of degraded areas for potential restoration. As yet, there are relatively few assessments of above-and belowground carbon in South African wooded biomes, such as thicket (e.g. Mills et al. 2005;Stickler and Shackleton 2015), savanna (Scholes and Walker 1993) and indigenous forests (Glenday 2007). Within this context, this study sought to (1) determine the rate of forest reduction or gain in the central section of the Wild Coast and (2) translate the changes in forest abundance (areas and biomass) to changes in terrestrial carbon stocks.",

This study aimed to evaluate the soil carbon stock in various land uses at different depths in the hilly terrain of Mizoram, Northeast India. Soil samples at 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm soil depths were collected from Rubber plantation (RP), Oil palm plantation (OPP), Teak plantation (TP), Bamboo Forest (BF), 5 years fallow (5YF), 10 years fallow (10YF), Tephrosia candida plantation (TCP), Horticulture garden (HORT), Homegarden (HG) and Natural forest (NF). Soil carbon stock varied significantly (p <0.05) across the land uses and depths. The soil under Tephrosia candida stand had significantly (p <0.05) higher values of C stock (73.66 Mg ha -1 ) which may be due to high biomass, dense vegetative cover and high C in root exudates. The minimum C stock estimated in Horticulture garden (43.28 Mg ha -1 ) is probably due to reduced soil organic matter. Soil carbon stock in Homegarden, Teak plantation, Bamboo forest and Rubber plantation ranged from 46.82 Mg ha -1 to 59.34 Mg ha -1 whereas 5 years and 10 years fallow land, Natural forest and Oil palm plantation ranged from 61.35 Mg ha -1 to 73.35 Mg ha -1 .

The aim of this study was to provide allometric equations for total above-and below-ground biomass and total root biomass and length for eight common evergreen conifer and broadleaved species.Methods: In a plot-based field trial, growth metrics of conifers Prumnopitys taxifolia (matai), Agathis australis (kauri), Prumnopitys ferruginea (miro), Podocarpus totara (totara), Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea) and Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu) and broadleaved species Alectryon excelsus (titoki) and Vitex lucens (puriri) were measured annually. These species were selected based on their potential role as a long-term solution for mitigating erosion in areas of marginal land proposed for new afforestation/reforestation and as an important carbon (C) sink.Results: Root collar diameter (RCD) provided the best fit for tree height, total above-ground biomass (AGB) and total below-ground biomass (BGB), and all regressions were highly significant (P = 0.001). Most species showed significant increases in annual growth and, by year 5, the BGB ranged between 21 and 42% of total biomass and decreased with increasing plant age. Of the conifers, Podocarpus totara had the greatest mean maximum root spread (2.2 m) exceeded only by the broadleaved Vitex lucens (2.5 m). For all species, and in each year of the trial, 100% of the BGB remained confined to within 0.5 m of the ground surface.

Conclusions: Inter-species differences in the allocation of BGB and AGB appeared to be age dependent. The root-growth metrics of these common indigenous forest species, as candidates for erosion control, have improved our understanding of their potential usefulness for stabilising marginal land.

Abandoned pastures are frequently reforested by planting monoculture timber plantations, resulting in reduced aboveground diversity and changes in soil characteristics compared to primary forests. In this study, we evaluated differences in soil properties (litter layer thickness, pH, water content, and C-to-N ratio) between degraded primary montane forest and monoculture pine (Pinus patula) and alder (Alnus acuminata) plantations and their effects on density, diversity, and community structure of litter and soil-living mesofauna, with focus on oribatid mites (Acariformes). The study was performed in a montane region in the southern Ecuadorian Andes (2,000-2,600 m a.s.l.). C-to-N ratios in the litter and upper 5 cm soil layer were higher in pine plantations, while other soil characteristics were similar between vegetation types. Surprisingly, microbial biomass and density of soil mesofauna in the litter layer did not differ between vegetation types, while density and species richness of oribatid mites were higher in pine plantations. Community structure of oribatid mites differed between vegetation types with only a few species overlapping. The results indicate that quality and diversity of litter were not the major factors regulating the mesofauna community. Instead, soil animals benefited from increased habitat structure in thicker litter layers and potentially increased availability of root-derived resources. Overall, the results suggest that from a soil animal perspective, monoculture plantations are less detrimental than commonly assumed and enrichment of abandoned plantations with native tree species may help to restore tropical montane forests.",

However, anthropogenic pressures such as aquaculture development threatened this highly susceptible ecosystem. Thus, the need to rehabilitate abandoned aquaculture ponds is a must to offset the ecological losses over the economic gains derived from these mangrove land-use changes. Thus, we chose a reforestation site of a once heavily utilized fishpond devastated by a tsunami in the late 1970s in Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. We then established a similar study plot in a nearby natural mangrove forest as a point of reference. We determined the heterogeneity in vegetation and estimated the aboveground and soil carbon storage capacities.

As a whole community, mangroves can thrive in a wide range of harsh environmental conditions and share unique adaptive traits such as salt excreting leaves, exposed breathing root system, and the production of viviparous propagules [1]. Mangrove ecosystems provide livelihoods, essential sources of protein, and coastal protection. Compelling evidence suggests that mangroves play an important role in climate stabilization, possessing carbon storage and sequestration potential greater than that of tropical forests [2]. Mangroves stores up to 455-856 Mg C ha -1 of forest and 6.2-11.0 Pg C ha -1 in the world [3][4][5]. Mangroves are important in the context of climate change [6]. They protect the coastal communities from frequent typhoons and storm surges [7] and provide tidal belts against the rising sea level [8]. However, mangrove forests are one of the most severely threatened and undervalued ecosystems. They are highly susceptible to climate change impacts and anthropogenic activities [9,10], resulting in a 30-50% decline globally [2]. Statistics reveal an alarming global rate of destruction of 3500 ha yr -1 [8], with 0.16%-0.39% annual losses [11,12]. The rate of disappearing mangroves in this century is up to 50% in countries such as India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In the Americas, they are being cleared faster than tropical rainforests [11,12]. The Philippines is an archipelagic country made up of more than 7107 islands located along the tropical band where mangroves thrive and has one of the longest coastlines in the world, extending up to 36,289 km [13,14]. Hence, the diversity of mangroves is relatively high due to their geographical location.",

The country holds at least 50% [9] of the world's approximately 65 mangrove species [15]. It is one of the top-15 most mangrove-rich countries in the world [1]. In 1920, there were 400,000-500,000 hectares of mangroves in the Philippines, but by 1995, there were only about 117,700 hectares [14,16,17]. The decline may be attributed to overexploitation by converting mangroves for aquaculture farming, pollution, human encroachment, and climate change during the last century [18]. Among these factors, aquaculture remains the major cause, as mangroves declined at 5000 ha yr -1 in the 1950s through the 1970s when the government promoted a pro-aquaculture policy [19]. According to Janssen and Padilla (1997) [20], 261,400 ha of formerly mangrove area had been converted to brackish water fishponds. When the mangroves are converted for aquaculture, various ecosystem services are traded for a single use. These changes can lead to further deterioration and decrease of diverse floral and faunal communities leading to drastic changes in species composition [20]. The mangrove forest cover in the Municipalities of Pitogo and Tabina, Zamboanga del Sur, Mindanao Island, Philippines, are among the largest mangrove areas on the Zamboanga Peninsula. However, these mangrove areas significantly declined from 640 hectares in 1947 to 462 hectares in 2000 and further down to 403 hectares in 2010 [21]. The mangrove forest cover in these two towns has declined by around 37% during the last 63 years. This is a significant deviation from the national trend of growing mangrove coverage [17].",

This corresponds to an average of 3.8% domestic loss per year, which is 1.8 times higher than the estimated loss worldwide at 2.1% per year (UNEP, 2006). If the mangrove forest cover continues to decline at the current rate, which may further be exacerbated by the conversion of mangrove areas for other uses such as aquaculture, human settlement, and development, the mangrove forest cover in the two municipalities will definitely be lost in less than 26 years [17]. To combat mangrove losses, rehabilitation is highly regarded as an essential management tool [18,22,23]. Management plans to replant abandoned aquaculture lands will make a difference in ameliorating climate change [20]. Having seen the dire condition of abandoned aquaculture ponds in Zamboanga del Sur, mangrove reforestation efforts were initiated in the early 1990s. However, there was no follow-up monitoring and assessment made on the planted mangrove species' survival and mortality, making it difficult to elucidate how these efforts have improved the ecosystem's functionality. Mangrove researchers worldwide appeal to an updated status of the last remaining mangroves, especially on their carbon dynamics, due to their ability to store carbon [24,25]. In an attempt to augment the limited reports on the status of mangrove-reverted abandoned fishponds in the Philippines, we heeded this call by assessing the carbon storage potential of these important mangrove habitats in the Zamboanga Peninsula, 30 years after reforestation. In this study, we established sampling plots around the rehabilitated abandoned fishpond. This is to determine how rehabilitation efforts improved the above-and-belowground carbon storage capacity. We also established a similar study plot in a nearby natural mangrove forest as a point of reference. We determined the heterogeneity in vegetation in both sampling sites and estimated the aboveground and soil carbon. We also examined the changes in carbon stocks from the landward to seaward zones.",

Our study supports the broader call for abandoned aquaculture rehabilitation and protection of mangrove forests from further destruction to sustain their roles in mitigating the impacts of climate change. We especially highlight the carbon sequestration and storage potentials of mangrove-reverted abandoned fishponds by generating a pool of reliable data and information for sound mangrove forest management interventions.",

Species Composition R. mucronata and R. apiculata were widespread in all identified zones of both natural and reforestation sites from seaward to landward. In the natural forest site, these Rhizopora species account for about 73% of the total number of individuals (Figure 3), while together, they constitute 49% in the reforested site. The distribution of R. mucronata and R. apiculata all over the sampling zones in both sites suggests their tendency to thrive well, survive, and dominate the mangrove area. Their widespread distribution indicates that they can survive high currents and tidal fluctuations. The high frequency of these Rhizophora species can be attributed to the viability of their fruits, which can last for months and may eventually grow as it reaches a suitable site. These species produce single-seeded fruits that germinate while still on the tree [17,39]. These findings are consistent with the study, which found that the Rhizoporaceae family was abundant in their study sites, with R. apiculata having the highest count per unit area [40]. In the reforestation site, R. mucronata is the most common species. When the abandoned fishponds were rehabilitated, R. mucronata was used because this species can grow anywhere in the mangrove area. R. mucronata species is widely distributed from the seaward to landward zones, although these species favor soft mud with tidal water. The high survival of the R. mucronata species that can survive high currents and tides makes these species abundant in all mangrove areas in the Philippines and even in other countries [41]. Moreover, the recruitment of propagules of the genus Rhizopora is very fast. Hence, this species is highly preferred in any mangrove reforestation effort. The abundance of R. mucronata in our study site was consistent with other studies in Imelda, Dinagat Island [40], and in Tacloban City [42], both in the Philippines.",

This case study in the Panama Canal Watershed explores the viability of enrichment planting for rehabilitating underperforming teak (Tectonia grandis) plantations, which are common in the area. Two high-value timber species native to the neotropics, Dalbergia retusa and Terminalia amazonia, were underplanted in an established teak plantation at the Agua Salud research site in the province of Colon, Panama. Seedling survival, basal diameter, height, total biomass and relative growth rate were assessed for the two years following planting. In contrast with the widespread belief that teak is a poor nurse tree, both species achieved promising early growth with low mortality in plantation understory conditions. Neither understory light availability nor combined above-and below-ground effects of crowding pressure from teak strongly predicted growth of either species. D. retusa, thought to be more shade-tolerant, performed equally across a range of intermediate light levels whereas T. amazonia, thought to be more heliotropic, performed best at the highest light levels, though light relationships explained little variation in seedling growth. These early findings support the suitability of either species for use in enrichment plantings in established, underperforming teak plantations in the Panama Canal Watershed. Longer-term research is needed to evaluate the potential of enrichment planting to increase profitability and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water resource management in these plantations.",
        "b9a68b20-3a7a-4aed-ac74-d58b94d30df2": "As natural forests continue to decline worldwide, forest landscape restoration (FLR) and plantation forestry are increasingly important for maintaining tree cover (Paquette et al. 2018;Paquette and Messier 2010;Keenan et al. 2015). This is especially true in tropical forests, which are the most threatened by anthropogenic forest removal and offer the largest potential gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services if restoration is implemented (Benayas et al. 2009). Conservation efforts should directly address the economic pressures driving deforestation, and financial incentive can greatly improve the participation of private landowners in FLR programs (Wunder et al. 2008). To this end, plantation forestry has been heralded as an ecological-economic \"win-win\" as an opportunity for rural landowners to generate income while preserving the ecosystem services provided by natural forests (Indufor 2012;Kissinger et al. 2012). However, in practice, the ecological and economic benefits of plantations are equivocal and largely depend on management and species selection. Insecure land rights and long return times on initial financial investments constrain the social and economic benefits of plantations for low-resource producers (Brown et al. 2008). Plantations are often established by large corporations that purchase land from locals and provide minimal long-term benefits to rural communities (Sloan 2008). The majority of tropical plantations, and especially large corporate projects, are planted with exotic species, which may not provide the same ecosystem services as native forests (Davis et al. 2012;Trujillo-Miranda et al. 2020). On a landscape scale, plantations can contribute to a heterogeneous mosaic of land uses and increase per-area productivity to facilitate conservation and minimize over-harvesting of natural forests in other areas (Parrotta et al. 1997;Paquette and Messier 2010), as well as enhancing benefits of natural forests by buffering edges and increasing connectivity amongst forest fragments (Brockerhoff et al. 2008).",
        "31d74645-c2eb-4843-a7bd-bea6fea1203a": "2008). However, studies of understory plant biodiversity and wildlife habitat within plantations present mixed findings (Cusack and Montagnini 2004;Barlow et al. 2007;Bremer and Farley 2010;McFadden and Dirzo 2018). Plantation establishment and management practices are critical factors in determining ecological benefits (Aubin et al. 2008;Paquette and Messier 2010), and active management of plantation understory may be necessary to encourage a future forest trajectory that is similar to reference plant communities in natural forest (Parrotta et al. 1997). There is increasing interest in incorporating native timber species in FLR and plantations to increase productivity and provision of ecosystem services, but, despite a long history and rich local knowledge of forest stewardship in many areas, a lack of silvicultural information is a major barrier preventing the utilization of a greater diversity of species (Hall et al. 2011;Davis et al. 2012). There is strong evidence across biomes for Enrichment Planting (EP) as a low-risk strategy for incorporating native species and increasing both ecological and economic value of timber plantations (Paquette et al. 2006;Millet et al. 2013;Ou\u00e9draogo et al. 2014). In enrichment planting, valuable species are introduced to the understory of already-established plantations or natural forests, increasing structural complexity and species diversity and providing a more sustained harvest through the incorporation of later-successional trees (Paquette et al. 2006). The partially-shaded conditions of an EP setting can improve seedling survival of later-succession species when compared with full-sun conditions (Ashton et al. 1997;Cole et al. 2011), but light availability can also limit growth of understory seedlings (Rappaport and Montagnini 2014). EP in existing plantations minimizes establishment costs and can increase long-term economic value through the introduction of slower-growing species (Keefe et al. 2012).",
        "5502032d-859e-4643-9f80-a2fca5d6b685": "2012). However, outcomes of mixed-species plantings are difficult to predict due to unique and understudied light and other site requirements of native tropical species (Redondo-Brenes and Montagnini 2006). Poor performance can greatly reduce or negate financial benefits for land managers (Keefe et al. 2012). EP success is therefore contingent on an appropriate matching of species with both abiotic site conditions such as fertility and the preexisting biotic neighborhood, which has limited the broad application of this technique (Paquette et al. 2006). Here, we present a case study of EP in the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW), where the viability of this strategy for enriching the area's exotic timber plantations has not yet been experimentally tested. The vast majority of PCW plantations are monocultures of teak (Tectona grandis)-an exotic timber species that is highly valuable but ill-suited to the area's infertile, poor-drainage clay soils (Hall 2013;Stefanski et al. 2015). Panama has the third highest proportion of planted teak coverage of any country worldwide (Kollert and Cherubini 2012), though it accounts for less than 1% of estimated 4.35 to 6.89 million ha of teak plantations worldwide (Kollert and Kleine 2017). In the PCW traditional cattle ranching has been found to provide similar or greater net profitability than teak plantations on an area basis (Stefanski et al. 2015), and the lack of financial gain from teak may be contributing to the slower-than-projected progress of reforestation efforts in the area (Dale et al. 2003). Additionally, there is evidence that these plantations are not achieving other desired forest functions such as water resource balancing, soil conservation and carbon sequestration (Kraenzel et al. 2003;Fern\u00e1ndez-Moya et al. 2014).",

Critically, teak plantations may not provide the hoped-for \"sponge effect\" of tree cover: increasing infiltration during periods abundant rainfall, then slowly releasing stored water over drier periods (Pe\u00f1a-Arancibia et al. 2019). Teak's low transpiration efficiency and high water use (Cernusak et al., 2007;Sinacore et al. 2019) may counter the benefits of enhanced groundwater infiltration from planting trees (Hassler et al. 2011;Ogden et al. 2013). The hydrological function of forests can be important for erosion prevention, flood mitigation and year-round fresh water supply in many regions and across spatial scales (Adamowicz et al. 2019;Noordwijk et al. 2017;Zhang et al. 2017), and is especially crucial in the PCW, where seasonal high-and low-flows routinely threaten Canal operations (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. 2002). One study comparing hydrological services in different forest types of Costa Rica found that topsoil hydraulic conductivity, a key factor in determining peak flow rates and dry-season water availability, was significantly lower in teak plantations versus natural forests, though authors note that plantation age and management were also important sources of variability (Fern\u00e1ndez-Moya et al. 2013). While EP has proven to be a successful strategy for increasing ecological benefits of plantations in many contexts (Lamb et al. 2005;Davis et al. 2012), there is some doubt that teak can serve as an appropriate nurse crop for EP seedlings. A number of studies have put forth both chemical and physiological explanations for the widespread idea and observation that teak overstory impedes understory growth (Healey and Gara 2003).",

In addition to chemical components, teak leaves have a large surface area that may create excessively shaded conditions (Healey and Gara 2003) and increase raindrop size which can ultimately reduce infiltration rates (Calder 2001).",
        "dcdcdb19-1b7a-4a69-956e-1c7d7397a968": "The results of this study suggest that, contrary to popular belief and findings from previous studies, teak plantations can provide suitable conditions for EP establishment and early growth. D. retusa and T. amazonia responded similarly to crowding pressure from teak overstory, and these effects appear to be driven primarily by competition for resources other than light. When light conditions were considered on an individual seedling rather than plot level, there were slight among-species differences in growth response. The high survival of EP seedlings in this study provides no evidence that teak overstory impedes early survival of either T. amazonia or D. retusa. The low mortality we observed for both species is consistent with findings in full-sun plantation conditions; Mayoral et al (2017) recorded < 2% mortality after 5 years in Agua Salud's native species plantations, and Hall and Ashton (2016) found < 10% mortality in a wet, infertile site for both study species. These longer-duration studies give no indication that the high survival we observed should be expected to decrease significantly in future years. Past studies attribute findings of an inhibitory effect of teak on understory establishment to the species' heavy water usage, large leaf size and alleliopathic chemicals (e.g., Biswas and Das 2016;Healey and Gara 2003;Leela and Arumugam 2014). The transplanted seedlings in our study were already past the germination and early growth stages evaluated in other studies so may have been better able to overcome the possible presence of inhibitory chemicals. Our study species are also known to perform well on acidic, low-fertility soils (Mayoral et al. 2017), so may not be affected by lower pH due to acidic teak leaf litter in the same way as annual crop species used in other experiments. Furthermore, native species from areas of wet/dry climate cycling may be adapted to periodic water stress and therefore resilient to amplified dry season water shortages due to plantation uptake.",
        "e96d3d6e-0808-4dcd-8332-6ef0e617f670": "While D. retusa is known to be drought-tolerant, T. amazonia is associated with wetter areas (Craven et al. 2011); historic drought conditions over the duration of this study (Bretfeld et al. 2018) may have contributed to the slightly higher, though still low, mortality observed in T. amazonia seedlings (Sinacore et al. 2019). Without direct evaluation, it is important not to over-generalize plantation effects on water availability, fertility and other soil characteristics; this depends on many factors including age, species, level of diversity, and management (Delagrange et al. 2004;Fern\u00e1ndez-Moya et al. 2013). In contrast to common assertions, Fern\u00e1ndez-Moya et al. (2014) 1 3 found no evidence that teak plantation establishment lowers pH and increases soil erosion; the authors suggest that management is more important in determining plantation effects on soil than any intrinsic quality of teak. These findings align with a recent Agua Salud study comparing decomposition and below-ground microbial activity among plantations of teak, D. retusa and T. amazonia (Kerdraon et al. 2019). These authors found similar nutrient content and pH in T. amazonia and teak plantations (though higher for D. retusa, which is expected given its nitrogen-fixing activity). Dry-season soil water content was similar in D. retusa and teak plantations (though higher for T. amazonia, which forms a denser canopy and is not deciduous in the dry season). The potential effect of overstory trees on EP seedling performance ranges from facilitation, by amelioration of harsh growing conditions, to suppression, through competition for resources such as light, water and nutrients. The slight, negative relationship between the growth of both EP species in this study and localized (plot) teak BA, a distant-independent metric of crowding pressure (Kuehne et al. 2019), does not suggest any facilitative effects and indicates slight suppression of EP growth with increasing teak density.",
        "7f9db6fd-f9c2-4f93-9f28-08405fd05272": "This finding aligns with past EP studies of different target species that have identified a tradeoff between growth and survival at varying overstory densities; survival is higher in more shaded conditions, but growth is slower (Millet et al. 2013). In a similar EP study of native seedlings in an exotic timber plantation in Sri Lanka, the greatest EP seedling growth was achieved with the highest levels of overstory removal (Ashton et al. 1997). A meta-analysis of EP studies across biomes found that in tropical systems growth was much greater in intermediate-versus high-density overstory, while further thinning reducing overstory from intermediate-to light-density had only slight growth benefits (Paquette et al. 2006). The weak relationship between crowding pressure and EP performance in our study could be due to a low to intermediate overstory density in Agua Salud; these data do not allow for the evaluation of high-density overstory. Though teak in the Agua Salud plantation were planted in a triangular format with 3-by-3 m spacing, thinning and pruning combined with poor growth provide less-crowded conditions than in similarly-spaced but better-performing or differently managed plantations. Studies in older and more densely-growing plantations could provide further insight into how crowding by teak affects EP performance. Our sequential (Type I) ANOVA approach allowed us to partition the effects of light availability (transmission coefficient) from overall crowding pressure (teak BA), which includes competition for belowground as well as aboveground resources. Though only slightly over half of the variation in light availability was explained by crowding pressure, crowding pressure accounted for all of the effects of light availability on seedling growth. The significant negative effect of crowding pressure not explained by the effects of light availability suggest that belowground dynamics may be important in understanding and predicting EP performance. Further partitioning of crowding pressure to assess nutrient and water availability as separate factors could provide additional insight into the observed suppression of EP growth at increasing overstory densities.",
        "dbf2b18e-8a84-4208-b6e9-e6027e2decad": "From a management perspective, our findings support the usefulness of distant-independent crowding metrics, which are far less labor-intensive to obtain than spatially explicit measures, in predicting EP performance. While not a significant predictor of seedling growth on a plot level, among-species differences in response to light emerged when assessed on a finer spatial scale. T. amazonia achieved maximum growth near the highest light levels (96% transmission coefficient) tested in this study, and growth decreased slightly but significantly at lower levels. D. retusa achieved equivalent growth across the broad range of intermediate light levels this species was exposed to (12-78% transmission coefficient). T. amazonia is categorized as a long-lived pioneer species that performs well in typical full-sun plantation establishment conditions (Nichols 1994), and a previous study found that first-year growth and survival were lower in understory light conditions versus small-gap conditions of higher light availability (Augspurger 1984). In contrast, Craven et al. (2011) found that T. amazonia maintained constant growth with decreased spacing, suggesting that early performance is not affected at low levels of light competition. In our study system seedlings tolerated light availability lower than 25% transmission with only a minor decrease in growth relative to higher-light seedlings, supporting the Craven et al. (2011) observations. Some prior studies noted an increase in T. amazonia aboveground growth rates after the first 2 years (e.g. Mayoral et al. 2017), suggesting that initial growth may not be indicative of longer-term trends. Continued monitoring in this study system will provide insight into whether light availability affects height or BD growth beyond the early seedling stage. The lack of any significant relationship between light availability and D. retusa performance, even when non-linear (quadratic) models were explored, aligns with D. retusa's classification as more shade-tolerant relative to T. amazonia. Future EP studies involving denser overstory would be useful in assessing whether D. retusa growth is related to light availability at lower ends of the spectrum.",
        "26da126a-b9a8-4450-bf4f-fb93ef945604": "It should be noted that even the lowest light levels in this study are still substantially higher than typical tropical rainforest understory conditions. Measurements of relative irradiance, comparable to this study's transmission coefficient, in the understory of tropical moist forest on Panama's Barro Colorado Island and in Agua Salud primary forest averaged less than 2% (Wirth et al. 2001;van Breugel et al. 2013), which aligns with other past studies (e.g. Baraloto et al. 2006;Gustafsson et al. 2016). Given that planting year and specific site conditions can greatly influence seedling growth, directly comparing growth rates across different studies does not provide an accurate assessment of performance in full-sun versus EP. However, considering results and patterns from past trials involving our study species can provide potentially important insights. In Agua Salud's native species plantations adjacent to this study site (established in 2008 in full-sun but otherwise nearly identical site conditions), Mayoral et al. (2017) found that D. retusa seedlings were taller and thicker in the initial 2 years, but in subsequent years T. amazonia growth rates increased significantly. Seven years after planting, T. amazonia had far surpassed D. retusa and all other study species by every measure of growth. This is consistent with the current study's finding that, while D. retusa seedlings outperformed T. amazonia in all absolute growth measures after the second year, the RGR of seedlings calculated between year 1 (2016) and two (2017) was not significantly different. Craven et al. (2011) andvan Breugel et al. (2011) also evaluated the first two years of D. retusa and T. amazonia growth planted in full-sun in Panama. Craven et al.",

(2011) observed similar trends as the present study in a study site near Agua Salud with similar climate but more fertile soils: D. retusa seedlings had lower mortality and more rapid growth (height, BD and RGR) than T. amazonia. In contrast, van Breugel et al. (2011) found that in 2 years T. amazonia grew taller on-average than D. retusa in a wetter site characterized as infertile, though with much higher nutrient availability than Agua Salud soils. A study in the Darien region of Panama evaluated teak, T. amazonia and D. retusa, among other species, for use in the \"taungya\" system of cultivating annual crops within timber plantations (Paul 2014). Here, seedlings were planted in full-sun conditions in a similar climate but with different and more fertile soil characteristics than our study site. In the Darien site two-year growth (height and DBH) was higher for T. amazonia than D. retusa, though teak outperformed both native species. In three of the four aforementioned studies, average heights were taller for both species than in our EP study. In contrast, on soils very similar to our study, Mayoral et al. (2017) found that D. retusa grown in full-sun at Agua Salud were shorter and thinner on-average than EP seedlings in our study while full-sun T. amazonia grew larger on-average than the EP seedlings. The superior relative performance of D. retusa in a partially-shaded EP setting versus full-sun is consistent with the species' greater shade tolerance compared with T. amazonia, though there was not a significant interaction between light availability and species in either our plot-level or individual seedling EP growth models. Overall lower seedling growth in our study compared with prior results is not surprising given the historic drought conditions of 2015 and 2016 and more productive soils of the other study sites.

Drought tolerance may additionally explain this species' achievement of stronger growth in drought conditions compared with the earlier Agua Salud study during wetter years (Mayoral et al. 2017). A controlled experiment with treatment groups for both full-sun and EP would allow for a more accurate comparison of growth rates between the different establishment and early growth conditions. The Agua Salud teak that provide the overstory for this study were first measured 4 years post-planting, so data is not available for a direct comparison with early growth rates of the native species in this study. However, even with considerable post-planting fertilization and liming to raise soil pH, Agua Salud teak is underperforming and economic projections suggest that this plantation will not be financially profitable within the planned 20-year rotation (Hall 2013; also see Stefanski et al. 2015). In contrast, the EP of native species in the same site achieved promising early growth despite historic drought conditions and without the extensive investment in site preparation for teak establishment. Our findings support past studies suggesting that selected native species may outperform exotic species such as teak, which continue to dominate timber plantations in the PCW and across Latin America (Lam Bent et al. 2011;Davis et al. 2012;Sinacore 2018).",

Excavation to a level of 25 cm below the existing ground level increased the inundation time of tidal water from 463 to 7,597 hours per year, resulting in a significant increase of survival/growth rates for planted mangrove species, Rhizophora mucronata (RM) and Bruguiera cylindrica (BC), and of carbon stocks as well. RM showed high rates of standing biomass accumulation with 98.7 ton/ha while 28.8 ton/ha for BC was measured over 10 years in the excavated area. In contrast, the unexcavated area showed low rates of biomass accumulation, 1.04 ton/ha for RM and 0.53 ton/ha for BC in the same period.

The high carbon sequestration potential of coastal ecosystems and the growing interest for exploring its potential in existing and emerging climate change frameworks, have been intensively argued [3][4][5][6][7]. Signatory countries of the United Nations Climate Change Framework (UNFCCC) are obligated to submit annual National Inventory Submissions (NIS) to record the country's greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activity, as well as sequestration from land use and forestry [8]. The section of Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) in NIS, accounts for the carbon budget on the terrestrial ecosystem management including forests. However, this section solely includes the carbon budget relating to direct human management of ecosystems. Blue Carbon ecosystems, whether managed or not, are not accounted for under LULUCF and thus, not included in the UNFCCC. In order for Blue Carbon ecosystems to be accounted for in the LULUCF process, an important step would be to accumulate knowledge regarding the fate of blue carbon associated with land-use change and with vegetation recovery. There is still considerable uncertainty regarding these estimates, therefore multi-year measurements are necessary to improve our understanding, especially to determine human disturbance to carbon (C) storage, to assess the amount of C entering long-term storage. Blue Carbon sinks are lost at a rate of 0.7-7% annually; four times faster than the rate of rainforest loss [9][10][11][12][13]. Several decades of coastal exploitation, such as shrimp pond construction, led to a significant amount of soil carbon loss [14,15].",

As a consequence, large areas of abandoned shrimp ponds currently remain in an unproductive condition. This extraordinary abandonment is attributed to the fact that the majority of shrimp farms in Thailand are abandoned after five years because of drastic declines in yields resulting from shrimp viral disease [17]. There have been several attempts to restore abandoned aquaculture ponds back to mangroves. Rehabilitation of mangroves through restoring a natural hydrology was emphasized by Lewis [18,19]. Moreover, successful restorations of mangroves were achieved through restored hydrology alone [20], by hydrologic reconnection to the river [21] and by reopening obstructing banks [22]. However, these antecedent studies did not fully examine the effectiveness of hydraulic restoration for enhancement of C stocks. Understanding carbon changes due to these treatments is important in terms of carbon management against global warming.

Land degradation hotpots cover about 29% of global land area and are affecting about 3.2 billion people (Le et al., 2016). Land degradation takes many forms and affects forests, soils, water, biodiversity and economics and social services derived from the ecosystem (Nachtergaele and Petri, 2008). Land degradation is occurring in almost all terrestrial biomes and agroecologies, in both low and high-income countries (Nkonya et al., 2016). However, the impact is especially severe on the livelihoods of the poor who heavily depend on natural resources (Lal, 1995;Nellemann et al., 2009;Obalum et al., 2012;UNCCD, 2013;Jones et al., 2013;MacDicken et al., 2016). Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has experienced the most severe land degradation in the world, and accounts for the largest share at 22 percent of the total global cost of land degradation (Nkonya et al., 2016). Like other SSA countries, land resources in Ethiopia are facing intense degradation due to proximate drivers such as deforestation, soil erosion, agricultural land expansion and overgrazing (Tekle, 1999;Paulos, 2001;Nyssen et al., 2004), as well as other underlying drivers, such as weak regulatory context and institutions, demographic growth, unclear user rights to land, low empowerment of local communities, and poverty generally (Kirui and Mirzabaev, 2014).

For example, about 2.6 million hectares of the Amhara National Regional State (i.e., where this research is conducted) is considered as degraded with about 200,000e300,000 hectares of land covered by gullies (Lakew and Belayneh, 2012). About 70% of the region experiences moderate (>15 tons ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ) to very high erosion rates (>30 tons ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ); the regional forest resource has diminished (Meseret, 2016). Restoring degraded lands can be an effective solution for improving vegetation composition, sequestering carbon in vegetation and soil, and improving hydrological cycles and micro-climate (Mekuria et al., 2011b;Chirwa, 2014;Bortoleto et al., 2016;Dagnew et al., 2017).

During this same period (i.e., 2010e2015), SWC measures have been introduced in more than 3000 watersheds and more than 12 million hectares of land have been rehabilitated through implementing physical and biological conservation measures, including exclosures (Lemenih and Kassa, 2014;Seyoum, 2016). Exclosures are common land areas, which are traditionally 'open access,' where wood cutting, grazing, and other agricultural activities are forbidden or strictly limited as a means to promote the restoration and natural regeneration of degraded lands (Tesfaye et al., 2015). Restoring degraded ecosystems through the establishment of exclosures has become a common practice in the Ethiopian highlands (Mekuria et al., 2017). Also, the use of exclosures has gained widespread acceptance as a means to restore degraded rangeland ecosystems in many of the world's semiarid rangelands (Verdoodt et al., 2009). For example, Young-Zhong et al. (2005) have shown that excluding grazing livestock is considered as an alternative to restore vegetation in the semiarid Horqin sandy grassland of northern China. Rehabilitation of degraded rangelands has also been fostered through establishment of exclosures in Tanzania (Barrow and Shah, 2011), Kenya (Wilkerson et al., 2013;Mureithi et al., 2014), South Africa (Siebert et al., 2010), and Pakistan (Qasim et al., 2017).

The expansion of area under exclosures could therefore contribute to improved livelihoods over the medium-to long-term. Although there are encouraging results, the magnitude of the current scale of land degradation underscores the need for evidence-based restoration (Abiyu et al., 2017), as the drivers and costs of land degradation, as well as the effectiveness of exclosures to restore degraded landscapes, differ across localities due to the heterogeneity of local communities and management approaches (Mekuria et al., 2017). Also, existing case studies cannot adequately represent the diversity in soil, slope, exclosure management, climate, and topography in the Ethiopian highlands (Mekuria et al., 2015).",

To restore degraded communal grazing land, an exclosure was established in Aba-Gerima watershed, located in North-Western Ethiopia in 2012 (WLRC, 2012). This study was conducted in the region to investigate changes in vegetation composition, aboveground woody biomass and soil properties after the establishment of the exclosure on degraded communal grazing land. The key research questions that this paper addressed is that how do exclosures influence the restoration of native vegetation, enhancement of aboveground biomass and improvement of soil properties.",

Also, it is an indication that exclosures could contribute to both peoples' livelihood and environmental quality. In this line, several studies in eastern and horn of Africa (e.g., Metzger et al., 2005;Yayneshet, 2011;Chirwa, 2014;Wairore et al., 2015;Selemani, 2015), China (e.g., Park et al., 2013;Rong et al., 2014) and elsewhere in the world (e.g., Al-Rowaily et al., 2015) have shown that degraded semi-arid vegetation can be restored in relatively short time following the establishment of exclosures on communal grazing lands. Chirwa (2014) elaborated that halting deforestation and forest degradation rates in Africa is key to improve the livelihood of rural communities and adapt to climate change. The considerable (49%) difference between the exclosure and adjacent grazing land in aboveground biomass (Table 4) and vegetation composition (Table 2) could be explained in two ways. First, exclosure land management improves soil properties (Table 6), which consequently supports the restoration of native vegetation and accumulation of aboveground biomass. Second, free grazing in the adjacent communal grazing land aggravates soil and vegetation degradation. This in turn negatively affects vegetation restoration and accumulation of aboveground biomass. A study in Pakistan (Qasim et al., 2017) has shown that aboveground vegetation biomass significantly increased in 16-year old exclosures when compared to grazed site. Similarly, a study in Ethiopia (Yayneshet, 2011) reported a two-fold increase in aboveground biomass after 8-years of exclosure establishment. A study in China (Rong et al., 2014) has shown that excluding sheep grazing from desert steppe for 8 years approximately tripled the biomass of standing vegetation, especially the shrub component.",

The maintenance, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystems therefore form the basis of \"nature-based approaches\" to climate change mitigation and adaptation (Naumann et al., 2014). A study in south Africa (Petz et al., 2014) highlighted that the provision of ecosystem services is related to land management as unmanaged, pristine ecosystems provide a different mix of ecosystem services than ecosystems recently restored or managed as grazing lands. This study further elaborated that nature conservation and restoration is the best for the sufficient provision of multiple ecosystem services. In this line, the considerable (49%) increases in aboveground biomass following the establishment of exclosures indicates that exclosure land management could be a viable option to mitigate of and adapt to climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, restoring degraded vegetation through long-term conservation approaches such as exclosures leads to increased carbon absorption or sequestration (Powers et al., 2011;Mekuria et al. 2011bMekuria et al. , 2015)). Also, the improvement in species richness, diversity, and evenness (Table 4) is key to fostering other important ecosystem services, such as the conservation of native species, which in turn supports nutrition and building of the livelihood of local communities. The results demonstrated that landscape position influenced the restoration of vegetation and aboveground biomass (Table 5). The better vegetation composition and productivity at foot slope position in exclosures compared to mid-and upperslope positions (Table 5) could be attributed to the influence of landscape position in restoring soil properties and the existence of big size trees. For example, the foot slope receives overland flow and deposition from the upper and mid slope positions (Mekuria et al., 2009), which leads to the accumulation of fertile topsoil. This in turn support the fast growth of trees and grasses. However, upper slope position displayed better vegetation composition and biomass in communal grazing land compared to the mid-and foot-slope positions (Table 5). This could be attributed to the easy access of livestock in foot slope position, which results in vegetation and soil degradation.",

A study in Kenya (Mureithi et al., 2014) demonstrated increases in the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and microbial biomass contents and stocks following the establishment of exclosures. This study further explained that exclosures can have the potential for the restoration of soil quality through range rehabilitation. Similarly, a study conducted in east African savannah ecosystem (Yusuf et al., 2015) has shown that soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen stocks (TSN) are affected by grazing, but the magnitude is largely influenced by woody encroachment and soil texture. This study suggested that improving the herbaceous layer cover through a reduction in grazing and woody encroachment restriction are the key strategies for reducing SOC and TSN losses and, hence, for climate change mitigation in semi-arid rangelands. Our results have shown that exclosure land management can support to diversify the livelihood options of local communities, as most of the regenerated woody species are economically important (Fig. 4), and once vegetation is restored, income generating activities can be integrated. In this line, a study in Kenya (Nyberg et al., 2015) indicated that the adoption of exclosures as degraded land restoration option has enabled agricultural diversification, e.g. increased crop agriculture, poultry production and the inclusion of improved livestock. According to this same study, following the use of exclosures, livelihoods have become less dependent on livestock migration, are increasingly directed towards agribusinesses and present new opportunities and constraints for women. Experiences of seven different African countries (Kumar et al., 2015) demonstrated that the restoration of degraded landscapes support the local communities to harvest diverse products, ranging from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) used for food to non-edible forest products, fodder for livestock, small wildlife, and crops including cereals and legumes.",

Finally, three species were not important in the RE 13 and were not selected at this first stage of our restoration project. The high number of tree 14 species found in the RE suggests that the pool of species for ecological restoration is wide. 15 However, sampling in both ecosystem types helped us to reduce the number of species that will 16 require active restoration.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of the system, and the specific objectives of each project.",

Most notable of these are the 2011 Bonn Challenge and the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests, which aim to restore 150 million hectares of forest worldwide by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030, respectively [3]. These goals align with the Aichi target of restoring at least 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020 [4]. Restoration decision makers need guiding principles regarding how to invest limited resources for large scale forest restoration to achieve these goals [5]. A comprehensive global analysis of forest recovery is timely given the substantial resources being invested in forest restoration globally and regionally. Previous analyses have mostly focused on specific forest types (e.g., tropical), restoration approaches (e.g., secondary succession), and/or restoration outcomes (e.g. biodiversity or carbon accumulation) [6][7][8][9]. Predicting the rate and degree of forest recovery is challenging as both can be affected by a number of factors, such as past land use type, forest region, landscape context, and restoration approach [10][11][12]. In some cases, forests recover quickly when the impeding past land use (e.g., agriculture, logging) ceases and natural succession can proceed [13,14] (hereafter, passive restoration, Table 1; Fig 1a and1b). Meanwhile, in areas with extensive deforestation, a combination of limited seed dispersal, aggressive exotic vegetation, microclimatic extremes, and/or soil degradation can result in slow or no recovery [15]. Thus people often intervene in various ways to accelerate recovery, such as planting trees, amending soil, and recontouring topography (hereafter, active restoration; Table 1; Fig 1c and1d). Past studies have reported that the rate of forest recovery may vary substantially depending on the type of variable measured (e.g., biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling) [9,12,16].",

In other cases, active forest restoration can negatively affect natural regeneration [20], result in less diverse forests [21,22], produce 'disservices' such as reducing soil moisture [23], or may not be cost-effective [24]. Here, we compiled a large database of forest restoration studies globally to make robust conclusions about factors that affect forest recovery and, specifically, evaluate the value added of active forest restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative importance of several context-dependent factors underpinning outcomes of forest restoration. We analyzed restoration of floral and faunal abundance and diversity, and biogeochemical functions related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus compared to reference conditions (Table 1) and asked three main questions: (1) To what degree do floral and faunal abundance and diversity, and biogeochemical Active restoration: a range of human interventions in an effort to accelerate and influence the successional trajectory of recovery [10]. Degradation level: the degree to which the degraded conditions differ from the reference level. Degraded conditions: measurements taken soon after the prior land use ceased. Ecological restoration: the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed [25]. Passive restoration: ending the prior anthropogenic land-use type to allow the forest for natural or unassisted recovery [10]. Recovery completeness: the degree to which a metric type (i.e., abundance, diversity, and biogeochemical functions) measured in the restored site attains the reference level.

Studies on the dynamics of such restored forests are missing, and the evidence of restored forests with respect to their recreation value is also sporadic. To study the dynamics and management of restored forests-both replanted and recovered by spontaneous succession-on spoil heaps, we used a matrix growth model, which accounts for harvest, artificial and natural regeneration, and recreation value of these forest stands. The model calibration was performed on data from 250 inventory plots distributed across the Velk\u00e1 Podkru\u0161nohorsk\u00e1 spoil heap and the Maty\u00e1\u0161 spoil heap in the Sokolov brown-coal mining area.

The ecosystems in the whole mining area, not just in the mine, are covered up with overburden material excavated from the mine. During the operation of open-cast coal mines, the overlying spoil material above the coal layer is removed and deposited in spoil heaps. Therefore, the rehabilitation of the post-mining landscape is crucial not only for restoring biomass production, but also for the restoration of both the ecosystem structure and functions of such areas [1,2]. Extensive areas where mining activity terminates are usually transformed into forests, agricultural land, and artificial lakes. A technical reclamation is a traditional approach to restoration, which is focused on the restoration of soil productivity and production functions of the landscape (forestry, agriculture), or in the case of hydric reclamation, to the landscaping importance of water bodies [3]. From an ecological perspective, reclamation should enable the restoration of original ecosystems, as well as their functions and services. In this way, there is a strong relation between reclamation and ecosystem services [2,4]. The concept of ecosystem services can be used as an evaluation framework and for identification of the appropriate methods of landscape restoration in order to achieve targets related to both ecosystem health and the provision of ecosystem services to society [5,6]. In recent decades, a number of studies have looked at reclamation from a broader perspective, Forests 2022, 13, 1519 2 of 38 taking into account one or more aspects of ecosystem services. In addition to restoring productivity, they also consider other functions and important ecosystem services that the restored sites are to perform, in particular soil protection, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, water retention, biodiversity, or cultural functions such as recreation [4,[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. Especially when post-mining areas are located in the immediate vicinity of human settlements, the recreation functions of the restored ecosystems become more important.",

Because afforestation has been a popular reclamation practice for almost six decades, there are abundant reclaimed forests in the vicinity of several towns and villages in the Sokolov mining area that are particularly suitable for short-term recreation. However, many of these restored forests were left to grow without appropriate forest management, therefore, they are little used for recreation. As found by Braun Kohlov\u00e1 et al. [18,19], the attractiveness of the restored forests on the Sokolov spoil heaps for recreation is significantly lower than conventionally managed forest stands. As implied by Braun Kohlov\u00e1 et al. [18], to increase the recreation value of restored forest ecosystems, it is necessary to implement suitable silvicultural treatment at a young and middle age of these stands. An appropriate way to address this problem is to develop a forest growth model -and calibrate it using empirical data-that allows the study of the dynamics of restored forests and the evaluation of the thinning management alternative, including the effect of harvesting on the recreation value of these reclaimed stands. Although Frouz et al. [16,20] carried out the vegetation surveys with the basic dendrometric measurement at the largest Sokolov spoil heap-Velk\u00e1 Podkru\u0161nohorsk\u00e1 heap-in 2006 and in 2015, respectively, the small sample of plots-28 sampling plots in 2006 and 8 plots in 2015-was not sufficient for the parametrization of the growth model.

A matrix model of forest growth-firstly elaborated in the seminal works of M.B. Usher [22,23]-is a common approach when the stand-level dynamics on a size-structured population is simulated. Matrix growth models with the Usher matrix are among the empirical dynamic models that are widely used in forest growth modeling because of their ability to provide accurate and detailed simulations of forest stand dynamics structured according to tree-size distribution [24]. Compared to the stand-level and size-structured models, individual-based models are applied when the trajectories, spatial heterogeneity of individual trees, and inter-tree competition are accounted for [25]. However, individual-based models require a lot more data than stand-based models [26]. On the contrary, the shortcomings of matrix models are seen in the arbitrary division of size classes and the inability to incorporate the variability between trees of the same size class [27]. Detailed comparison and classification of growth models can be found in Liang and Picard [28] and Vanclay [29]. Many different types of matrix growth models were developed-with a wide range of forestry applications and across various types of forest ecosystems-and their linear and non-linear specifications from constant-parameter matrices to matrix models with stochastic vital rates or a geospatial dependence [30][31][32]. More recently, matrix growth models, due to their accuracy in predicting forest population dynamics, have been adjusted to account for climate variability, various forest management practices, and environmental disturbances (see [28]). An example of natural or anthropogenic disturbances are wild or managed fires. A matrix model was used in several applications to study forest restoration and dynamics of forest stands subject to fire [33,34].

Subsequently, we used the growth model to evaluate various management options (initial planting, thinning regime) and investigate how the respective management regime affects the recreation value and aboveground biomass of restored forest.

Interestingly, the significantly lower recreation value of early-stage restored stands was observed for spruce plantation compared to spontaneous succession [19]. This can be explained by a lower density of successional stands in their initial phase, while the spruce is planted in high seedling densities (10,000 seedlings per hectare). The level of shrub and herbaceous understory and ground deformations are among other stand-level attributes that affect peoples' preferences towards recreation in restored forests. While the effect of shrubs-the presence of shrub layer detracts from visual attractivity of restored stands-was taken into account in the model on recreation value (Equation ( 20)), the cover of the herbaceous understory was not measured on the inventory plots, and therefore, the presence of herbaceous vegetation was not considered in the model. This may result in higher estimates of the recreation value of restored stands, especially those with a thick herbaceous vegetation. This is particularly problematic in alder stands with a high fixation of natural nitrogen that supports the spreading of grasses such as Calamagrostis epigejos or Arrhenatherum elatius [36]. It was alder stands with a large understory vegetation of C. epigejos that were perceived as less attractive than other restored forest stands [18]. Ground deformations caused by the conveyor belt dumping and layering of overburden material into 1-2 m high waves during the technical reclamation of the spoil heap are a suitable place for the development of spontaneously emerging ecosystems and the growth of succession tree species [10,17]. However, visible ground unevenness present at unreclaimed places left to spontaneous succession detract from the attractiveness of successional stands for recreation, as proven by Braun Kohlov\u00e1 et al.

Pendula, P. sylvestris, P. abies) or middle (S. caprea) growth phases. In part, this may be influenced by less visible geomorphological irregularities in high growth stage stands due to geophysical processes. This might partially overestimate the predicted recreation value of successional forests in their early and middle growth stages. From the long-term perspective, we can, therefore, recommend the formation of numerous ridges and depressions when a spoil heap is created, supporting the emergence and growth of successional forests. At suitable places on the spoil heap, strongly deformed terrain with spontaneous succession can be carefully combined with a phytotoxic surface. This will create future open areas with scenic landscape views and a habitat for rare plant species [10]. Deeper deformities give birth to ponds and pools suitable for amphibians. After opening these locations with spontaneous succession to visitors, we can inform the public about the importance of habitats for biodiversity and its origins. This information can take many forms, such as information boards or natural trails. Furthermore, the findings of the current study indicate that thinning of different intensities increases the recreation value of restored forests, but at the same time the aboveground tree biomass significantly decreases, except on pine plantations. AGB and recreation value-measured as mean probability of a person's choice of a given forest type for a one-hour walk-of a 65-year-old pine stand is 84.9 t\u2022ha -1 and 0.49, if thinning management is regularly realized. On the other hand, larch plantations at the same age reach 35.6 t\u2022ha -1 AGB, but recreation value amounts to 0.61. In comparison to unmanaged stands, the AGB of 65-year-old larch stands due to thinning operations is decreased by Forests 2022, 13, 1519 22 of 38 61%, while recreation value is increased by 26%.",
        "5db1862b-ee03-4f8e-859f-dde74e219333": "The similar values and dynamics in AGB and recreation value as for larch stands are observed for alder plantations. Deciduous and spruce stands at the age of 65 reach 61.8 and 59.2 t\u2022ha -1 AGB, and their recreation value is 0.52 and 0.58, respectively. The regular thinning and, thus, subsequent decrease in AGB by 35% in both types of plantations will increase recreation value by 12% for deciduous stands and by as much as 20% for spruce stands. The highest increase in recreation value by 27% is observed for successional stands, which is accompanied by a 54% decrease in AGB. A 65-year-old successional stand reaches 42.5 t\u2022ha -1 AGB with recreation value at 0.60. From the timber production perspective of the individual forest types of restored stands, pine forests (usually P. sylvestris or P. nigra) created by plantation have an aboveaverage wood yield, especially if the thinning interventions are regularly realized in the middle and high growth phase. This is consistent with the findings of the study by Vacek et al. [53], which proved high productivity and stand volume of P. sylvestris on the reclaimed forest site at the Anton\u00edn spoil heap in the Sokolov mining area, even though the pine restored stand was insufficiently thinned out. At the same time, P. sylvestris was found to be very adaptive towards climate change. However, pine forests have worse pedogenetic characteristics than alder or succession forests, as confirmed by Melichar et al. [54] at the Velk\u00e1 Podkru\u0161nohorsk\u00e1 and Maty\u00e1\u0161 spoil heaps. The successional forests have an average wood yield, as was also confirmed by Vacek et al. [55] at the Anton\u00edn spoil heap.",

The mean stand volume of successional stands (Populus tremula, S. caprea, or B. pendula) were significantly lower than on afforested stands by Q. robur, B. pendula, or Alnus glutinosa. However, the reclaimed sites colonized with successional trees are significant for their pedogenetic process and tree and herbaceous diversity [54]. The higher species richness and total stand diversity of successional sites compared to replanted stands were also proven by Vacek et al. [55] for the Anton\u00edn heap. Forest plantations predominantly with alder have a lower-than-average wood yield; wood volume per hectare is less than for successional forests. This was confirmed at the Velk\u00e1 Podkru\u0161nohorsk\u00e1 heap by Frouz et al. [56], when woody biomass was significantly greater on successional sites (P. tremula and S. caprea) than on replanted sites by A. glutinosa at their high growth stages. Nevertheless, woody biomass was greater for alder stands than for successional sites at their early and middle growth stages. The stand volume of alder plantation at the high growth stage was also lower compared to replanted stands with Q. robur and B. pendula and the successional stand with P. tremula at the Anton\u00edn heap [55]. However, successional forests with S. caprea, or B. pendula had a lower stand volume than the alder plantation. Nonetheless, alder planting at spoil heaps is mainly motivated by its suitability as a preparatory tree species. The pedogenetic role of alder stands is crucial, even though natural conditions on soil heaps are less favorable for alders and, thus, cause its premature aging [54]. The species diversity of alder stands is also relatively high compared to spruce, pine, long-term deciduous, or silver birch plantations [36,55].",
        "bc0f2c9c-7e06-47d0-b709-afa074f7fd7a": "One of the limitations of the matrix growth model is the fact that the model is calibrated on the inventory data of the restored forests from early to high growth stage up to the age of 60 years at maximum, because older forest reclamations are absent in the Sokolov mining area and also in other coal mining areas in the Czech Republic. Therefore, we have used the model to simulate the forest dynamics and evaluate the effects of the thinning interventions for a period of 65 years. Beyond this time horizon, we would not be able to evaluate the errors between the predicted and actual stand states. The possible improvement of the model would be to establish the inventory system of permanent plots capturing a wide range of restored forest types, soil, and geomorphological conditions in the study site and to extend the simulation period beyond the current time horizon of 65 years. In addition, the vital rates including the diameter growth, mortality, and both artificial and natural recruitment rates were parametrized with one-time inventory plot data. Second forest inventory with dendrometric measurements on the same inventory plots as in 2018 could greatly enhance the validity of the estimated parameters of the matrix growth model (Equation ( 1)). Finally, in addition to the biomass production and recreation function, the restored forest ecosystems positively influence the properties of reclaimed soil, store carbon in AGB and in soil organic matter, and create the habitat conditions favoring herbaceous species diversity. Given the availability of data from pedological and phytocenological surveys [36,57] realized at the Sokolov spoil heaps in recent past, the opportunity exists to further extend the matrix model with the soil properties, carbon storage, tree and herbaceous diversity, and to study the stand dynamics from the perspective of the multifunctional use of restored forest ecosystems.",

Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under-investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrated the importance of soil indicators most commonly reported soil pH (71%, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66%, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5%, n = 40), while the least reported indicator was water retention (6.5%, n = 4). Only 40% of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of the Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content, and aboveground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analyzed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximize the successful outcomes of restoration.",

In response to land degradation and the need to recover services that ecosystems provide, such as biodiversity (Latawiec et al. 2016;Crouzeilles et al. 2017), carbon (Porter et al. 2009), or water (Ferraz et al. 2013), restoration has gained increased interest and has been promoted globally and locally (Aronson et al. 2011). For instance, the Bonn Challenge sets a goal to restore worldwide 150 million hectares of disturbed ecosystems and the 20x20 Initiative aims to bring 20 million hectares into restora-tion, both by 2020. The New York Declaration on Forests, endorsed by 190 countries and companies, establishes a global timeline to halve natural forest loss by 2020, and to end it by 2030. In Brazil, according to the National Plan for the Recovery of Native Vegetation (Planaveg 2016), approximately 12.5 million hectares will have to be recovered in the next 20 years. Regionally, the Pact for the Restoration of the Atlantic Forest aims to restore 15 million hectares in the biome by 2050 in an attempt to recover ecosystem services compromised by historical deforestation for coffee and sugarcane plantations that caused dramatic modification and degradation of this biome (Calmon et al. 2011). Currently, more than 80% of Atlantic Forest remaining is composed of forest fragments smaller than 50 ha (Ribeiro et al. 2009) and this biome suffered degradation to more extent than any other Brazilian biome. Restoration in this biome therefore faces great opportunities and challenges. Soil has been studied to lesser extent in the context of restoration than biodiversity, carbon, or water (Ohsowski et al. 2012) wherein both active planting and natural regeneration have been shown to impact the provision of these ecosystem services (Porter et al.",

Lack of adequate soil consideration has also been pointed out in the context of conservation, ecology, and carbon balance (Wardle 2002). Good soil quality promotes plant growth, regulates water distribution, and attenuates environmental degradation (Larson & Pierce 1991), and deforestation often leads to negative changes in soil chemistry, structure, and biota, impacting plant productivity and composition (Doran & Zeiss 2000;Centurion et al. 2001;Eviner & Hawkes 2008). Soil organic carbon affects important functional processes in soil like the storage of nutrients (mainly nitrogen), stability of aggregates, and water holding capacity (Silva & S\u00e1 Mendon\u00e7a 2007). Nitrogen in soil is a key nutrient and the most required by plants and it is essential in assessments of soil quality. Soil texture is an important physical indicator and it is correlated with hydrological process such as run-off, erosion, infiltration rate, and water holding capacity. It is an indicator very stable through time, mostly independent of the soil management. To assess whether forest restoration projects are feasible, monitoring of environmental quality, including soil analysis, and baseline assessment prior to monitoring are fundamental (Rocha et al. 2015). Soil chemical indicators are important when considering soil capacity to maintain nutrient cycling, plant biomass, organic matter, and for sustaining forest production and sustainability (Schoenholtz et al. 2000). The most important chemical indicators to be assessed are pH, available P, K, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn (Idowu et al. 2008). In addition, different native species often present symptoms of deficiency, if certain nutrients are not present in the soil (Sorreano et al. 2012). However, despite the importance of soil for the provision of crucial ecosystem services and although restoration efforts may fail if they do not consider the limitations of soil conditions, soil data are rarely reported in restoration projects (Ehrenfeld et al. 2005).",

Some authors claim that restoration is \"phytocentric\" and underestimates belowground environment and soil ecological knowledge (Callaham et al. 2008;Kardol & Wardle 2010;Ohsowski et al. 2012). Our systematic literature review investigates to what extent soil indicators are assessed within restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In addition, we analyzed a case study to explore the relationship between soil indicators and vegetation structure (basal area and tree height) within two areas restored in the Atlantic Forest. The overarching aim of this study was to verify whether a soil data gap exists in restoration projects. The results of this study may ultimately help scientists and decision-makers to plan restoration more effectively.",

The general objective of this work is to study the mid-term effects of thinning intensity on forest floor and soil properties after 13 years following the intervention. The experimental design consisted of a randomized block design with four thinning treatments (3 thinning intensity plots plus a control or unmanaged plot) and three blocks or replicates. Several determinations, such as total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, or basal respiration, were performed for characterizing forest floor and mineral soil by considering three random sampling points per experimental plot. Thirteen years after thinning, total organic content, the different organic carbon fractions studied, and basal respiration were higher in the forest floor of the unmanaged plot. These results, however, were contrasted to those obtained for the mineral soil, where significant differences between the treatments were only observed in basal respiration and C/N ratio, while the different organic carbon fractions were not affected by thinning intensity. Our results suggest better soil quality where biological activity is enhanced as a consequence of improved environmental conditions and also litterfall input. The latter is especially important in forests with tree leaves of low biodegradability, where new understorey species promoted by thinning can provide higher nutrient availability for the remaining trees and, therefore, better forest resilience.",

Carbon sequestration by forest soils has become a key mechanism for offsetting the greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel burning [1]. This is being clearly translated into national and international actions for mitigating climate change impacts, such as the plantation of 3 billion trees in the EU by 2030, following the new EU forest strategy (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/forest-strategy_en, accessed on 14 December 2021). Apart from planting new trees, thinning is a common silvicultural practice that may affect several aboveground and belowground processes by changing environmental conditions as well as stand structure and composition and soil properties [2]. The reduction in tree density normally decreases litter production and C content in the forest floor when the short-term effects of thinning are evaluated [3,4]. Conversely, thinning can increase Forests 2022, 13, 255 2 of 14 forest floor C content when a sufficient development of understorey biomass is capable of offsetting the decrease in tree litter production [5][6][7]. Mineral soil is less sensitive than forest floor to changes in aboveground biomass and requires longer recovery periods when soil carbon has been significantly changed by thinning [7,8]. James and Harrison [8] reviewed the role of harvesting on C in forest floor and mineral soil and observed significant reductions in both compartments but a much smaller reduction (-3%) in the 0-15 cm soil depth. For their part, Nave et al. [7] also found a higher reduction in the C of forest floor (-30%) but a non-significant harvest effect on mineral soil in their meta-analysis for temperate forests, and they discussed the complex role of soil type, species composition, and time as possible drivers of variation. Ruiz-Peinado et al. [9] found that thinning did not significantly affect soil organic carbon in a Mediterranean maritime pine forest 5 years after the last silvicultural intervention. Lull et al.",
        "a16027b6-56d3-4959-8bb2-b218c562053a": "Lull et al. [10] observed that selective thinning and shrub clearing did not negatively affect soil carbon pools and biological activity when woody debris was left on the forest floor in a Mediterranean Holm oak forest 7 years after intervention. These results are in accordance with Nave et al. [7], who observed that carbon loss is temporary and recovers over a period of 6-20 years after harvesting in similar soil types to the ones studied here. As stated in Zhang et al. [11], thinning intensity, time elapsed from thinning, and forest type are key aspects when evaluating forest thinning on soil carbon stocks and dynamics. Soils contain a variety of organic carbon fractions with different residence times and different sensitivity to environmental and management changes [12,13]. The dissolved fraction (water-soluble organic carbon) is likely the most labile and active form of soil organic carbon and, thus, the first available source for soil microorganisms and chemical conversion reactions [13,14]. This active fraction plays an important role in determining the structure and function of the soil ecosystem by acting as an energy source for heterotrophic organisms and as a reservoir of the dissolved fraction and plant nutrients [14]. In contrast, the passive fraction interacts with mineral surfaces, preventing organic matter decomposition through biochemical reactions [15]. The easily oxidizable carbon fraction can be considered as an intermediate kind. Most of the thinning studies have focused on changes in total soil organic C or the fraction that is easily oxidizable, and little attention has been paid to differentiate the role of thinning on the different soil organic carbon fractions (see [10,15] for exceptions). In addition, as thinning is expected to increase net rainfall water input [16] and soil temperature [11], complementary measurements of soil biological activity such as soil microbial biomass carbon or basal soil respiration can help to improve our understanding of the role of forest management on soil carbon fractions and dynamics [13,17]. In Spain, Pinus forests are the most extended forest type, occupying 32.6% of the total forested area in the country [18].",

In the case of the Valencian community, Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) forests are the most representative forests and account for 72% of the wooded area [19], and most of them are plantations characterized by high tree density because of low timber profitability. Aleppo pine residues are poor in nitrogen and highly recalcitrant and resistant to biodegradation in Mediterranean ecosystems [20]. Unmanaged Aleppo pine forest stands in southeastern Spain show values for carbon accumulation in litter and dead matter aboveground storage of 19.9 t ha -1 [21]. The accumulation of stable soil organic matter also increases the stock of organic carbon and nitrogen, thereby improving soil fertility, since, in mature forests, the main supply of nitrogen comes from the biogeochemical cycle (litterfall and decomposition) [22]. This study is carried out in a mature, overstocked Aleppo pine plantation established over 60 years ago in abandoned agricultural fields. Different thinning treatments were performed in 12 experimental units in 2008. Several results about the effect of thinning intensity on aboveground processes have been reported; the most recently published study focused on evaluating the mid-term effects on tree and stand-water relationships [23]. However, the impacts of thinning intensity on forest floor characteristics and soil organic matter stock remain unclear. In this sense, the general objective of this work is to study the effects of thinning intensity on forest floor and soil properties after 13 years following the intervention. To this end, the specific aims of this study are to: (1) determine the influence of thinning intensity on forest floor mass, carbon fractions, and basal respiration; (2) compare the thinning effects on soil carbon fractions, basal respiration, and organic N and C/N ratio; (3) study the relationships between forest floor and soil properties.",
        "31ec6879-896f-4267-9f3c-166f51497a9a": "Thirteen years after experimental thinning intensity treatments in a mature overstocked Aleppo pine plantation, significant differences between thinned plots and the Forests 2022, 13, 255 control plot were only observed in the forest floor compartment as a consequence of reduced litterfall. Our work highlights the important carbon sequestration role of this forest type, accounting for a total of 35.8, 41.6, 39.7, and 48.9 t C ha -1 for T10, T30, T60, and T100, respectively, when both the forest floor and the upper soil layer compartments are considered. Apart from local variations, both forest floor and soil compartments have been exposed to the same litter production for more than 55 years in our forest plantation, while the cumulative effect of tree removal has only happened for 13 years. Despite this long common time period for all the experimental plots, thinning significantly reduced forest floor fraction when at least approximately 50% of trees were removed (1289 versus 688 trees ha -1 for T100 and T60, respectively), and this reduction in both total organic matter and organic carbon has shown to be proportional to thinning intensity. Although forest cover was higher in T60 and the remaining trees showed better growth rates [23], this improvement in forest structure is not enough to compensate for the litterfall depletion. Our results are consistent with those obtained in another Aleppo pine plantation where all the thinning intensity treatments reduced total litterfall production and nutrient returns 12 years after intervention [3] and also in other types of conifer forests where long-term effects of thinning have been evaluated [30,31]. Lower forest floor quantity in the thinned treatments may be explained by lower litter inputs and/or by higher outputs (e.g., basal respiration, leaching of dissolved organic matter, mixing into the mineral soil by fauna, photodegradation) [30].",
        "b261cda5-9b20-4d28-8957-dff025765d4f": "Our measurements indicated a clear linear reduction of dissolved organic carbon fraction (WOC) in the forest floor with thinning intensity, higher basal respiration in the control treatment (T100) than in the most thinned one, and non-significant differences between T100 and the rest of the thinning treatments (see Table 2). Higher activity of microorganisms in T100 can be partly explained by the higher fraction of the most labile and mobile form of organic carbon, as WOC is the first carbon pool that is available to be consumed by microorganisms [10]. Needles of Aleppo pine have been identified as the most recalcitrant litter type in Mediterranean ecosystems [20], posing stronger resistance to microbial breakdown, and, thus, litter decomposition may become more strongly dependent on abiotic processes than on biotic ones [32]. In this sense, Almagro and Martinez-Mena [32], when comparing two Mediterranean ecosystems with different tree densities of Aleppo pine trees, observed higher decomposition in the plot with lower aboveground biomass but also with lower basal respiration in the forest floor. The authors explained this fact by the effects that a higher canopy cover may have when decreasing physical decomposition processes such as photodegradation or fragmentation of litter by raindrop impact and splash. In addition, Zhang et al. [11] observed that thinning significantly increased soil respiration in both broadleaved and mixed forests but not in coniferous forests due to the lower litterfall quality of the latter. Our results can thus be explained by lower litter inputs and also higher abiotic decomposition in the thinned plots, but especially in the T10, where effective rainfall and forest structure clearly differed with the rest of the thinning treatments [16,23]. In this respect, higher abiotic decomposition in T10 may be offsetting the higher basal respiration of T30 and T60.",
        "b367794c-02b1-40ae-ace7-ac4328554333": "We obtained mean values of 7094, 4815, and 2650 kg ha -1 (1.71, 1.10, and 0.65%) for the SOC fraction for the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm soil depth intervals, while a mean value of 35,160 kg ha -1 (4.7%) was found when considering total organic carbon (TOC) for the 0-10 cm soil depth interval. These values are in the range of other studies on Pinus species growing under Mediterranean conditions; for instance, Bautista et al. [29] reported a range of 1.1-5.4% for TOC in a Pinus halepensis plantation with different thinning treatments, while a mean value of 4.84% for SOC was reported in a plot with an intermediate forest cover dominated by Pinus pinaster [33]. Thirteen years after thinning, all the organic carbon fractions analyzed decreased with thinning intensity, but significant differences were not observed between the experimental plots. In this respect, when comparing the mean values between the most intense thinning treatments (T10 and T30) and the rest of the treatments Forests 2022, 13, 255 10 of 14 (T60 and T100), it can be observed that relative differences are of low magnitude, and they account for approximately 5%, 20%, and 10% for TOC, WOC, and SOC, respectively. Our sampling intensity is slightly lower than those observed in other studies [10,[34][35][36]. Thus, a significant effect of thinning is especially expected on WOC as a consequence of an increased sampling effort and, therefore, reduced data variability among experimental plots. In any case, these results are not consistent with the general findings obtained in the review work of James and Harrison [8] but are supported by the other reviews by Nave et al. [7], Zhang et al. [11] and Zhou et al. [37], who observed that thinning did not have significant effects on either total soil carbon or SOC.",
        "c8ef8038-20a4-4402-89c0-6ac323c0fc8e": "It is important to remark that these general results had a high number of sources of variability, and they also considered different data sources. When comparing our results to other studies with similarities in terms of thinning (intensity and time elapsed), forest structure and composition, and environmental conditions, TOC for the 0-10 cm soil depth interval was not significantly enhanced 13 years after thinning (light and heavy thinning interventions) in an Aleppo pine plantation very similar to ours [29]. In addition, other thinning experiments, conducted in the Mediterranean area for Pinus pinaster Ait. [9] and P. sylvestris forests [38,39], have found no differences when the mid-term effects of thinning intensity on soil carbon stock were evaluated. Nave et al. [7] found that thinning slightly reduced soil organic carbon, but it recovered over a period of 6-20 years after thinning due to changes in aboveground biomass and, therefore, in litter production. The organic carbon fractions in the forest floor were higher in the control treatment; thus, similar litter input quantities between the treatments is not a plausible explanation in our case [15]. A possible explanation may be related to the higher production of fine roots in the thinned plots [40,41], normally located in the 0-10 cm soil depth interval in forest soils. Lopez et al. [42] observed very similar fine root density dynamics between the heavily thinned plot (79% of basal area removed) and the control one in a Mediterranean holm oak forest 5 years after thinning, and root elongation was clearly explained by soil water content. The higher soil water content promoted by the thinning intensity in our case [23] may promote higher tree root formation and, therefore, higher colonization of the upper soil horizon. On the other hand, complementary measurements taken in our experimental plots clearly indicated the higher plant cover and density of understorey species, especially in the T10 plots [23]. In this sense, it is important to highlight the role of thinning may have on improving soil quality and, therefore, on nutrient availability for the remaining trees.",
        "80953dd2-d4a4-45d7-84f7-93e8ba8b02e5": "Lower C/N ratios for the treated plots in both forest floor and mineral soil, especially when comparing T10 and T100, may indicate a positive effect of thinning in microclimatic conditions and microbial substrate, therefore increasing N mineralization rate [29]. Better conditions, but also better quality (bio-degradability) C, in the leaves of the understorey species, as compared to P. halepensis needles [32], are expected to promote higher microbial activity, thus reducing the C/N ratio. As in the case of forest floor, WOC was linearly related to thinning intensity, indicating higher availability of this labile carbon fraction in T100. WOC is greatly affected by climatic conditions, and the highest value during the year is expected to occur in summer, when leaching is at a minimum [10]. At the moment of sampling, soil water content was very close to field capacity in all the treatments as a consequence of antecedent periods with high rainfall input (mean volumetric water content of 0.25 cm 3 cm -3 ). However, the cumulative effect of higher soil water content in the treated plots during the entire year is expected to promote higher WOC leaching [10,43]. Therefore, our results on C/N ratios in both forest floor and mineral soil indicate that, although higher carbon fractions in the soil promote a higher presence of microorganisms, this is not necessarily translated into a higher carbon decomposition rate. Most of the correlation results between forest floor and mineral soil properties were as expected, especially those indicating the role of the forest floor as a source of soil organic carbon, both the total and the soluble fractions. WOC in soil is composed of WOC leaching from litterfall, root exudates, and carbon from microorganism biomass [44]. A correlation between WOC from forest floor and mineral soil is thus expected as the former represents the main labile carbon input to the latter [10]. In addition, C stored in the soil is not only controlled by the carbon input from the forest floor but also by the potential of soil to stabilize organic carbon [43].",
        "9e1d5634-1ed1-49a0-b5ed-64a6f960fa7b": "In a study where the effect of thinning on different carbon fractions was tested in beech forests, the higher litter input in the control plots was not clearly reflected in increases in the carbon fractions [45]. The authors obtained clear positive relationships between clay and Fe contents with both fractions of organic carbon studied (light and heavy). In contrast, Cheng et al. [15] obtained opposite correlations, similar to ours, but the authors did not further discuss the role of thinning intensity or soil composition. We observed a negative effect of clay content on WOC and SOC (results not shown); thus, a plausible explanation for this effect remains open. On the other hand, the C/N ratios from forest floor and soil were clearly positively related. This indicates that environmental factors controlling organic carbon decomposition by microbial activity were affected in a similar way, highlighting the simultaneous effect of thinning on these two compartments. Finally, the results on soil quality through an index developed for soils from Mediterranean forests [27] revealed very similar values between our treatments, although this result should be taken with caution as we considered enzymatic activities that were not directly measured in our study site. In addition, as our results and also other works considering C/N as a key variable related to soil quality [46] suggest that the effects of other soil properties that are expected to be highly affected by understorey evolution should be considered when evaluating the mid-to long-term effects of thinning on soil quality.",

Above-ground biomass, nutrient concentration of above-ground tree tissues, and soil nutrients were examined in two young plantations of eight indigenous tree species grown in pure and mixed designs in a low fertility site in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica. The goal was to assess the role of nutrient accumulation in above-ground biomass on potential site nutrient decline, and to draw recommendations to conserve site nutrients in the long term.In Plantation 1, Jacaranda copaia pure stands had higher above-ground tree N, P, and Mg than the other treatments, while Vochysia guatemalensis had the greatest accumulation of K and Ca. For J. copaia, stem harvest would remove about 54% of total above-ground tree N, but about 80% of P, K, Ca and Mg. For V. guatemalensis, stem harvest would remove less than 30% of N but from 50 to 60% of total above-ground tree Ca, K, Mg and P. Branches and foliage summed together were 25 to 35% of total above-ground tree biomass, but they generally represented about 50% of above-ground tree nutrients. In Plantation 2, the mixed stands had the highest above-ground nutrient content for all nutrients, and both the mixture and Terminalia amazonia pure stands had the highest stem P and Mg.Five years after planting, decreases in soil P, K and Ca were apparent in pure plots of the fastest growing species with the largest accumulation of nutrients in above-ground biomass, such as J. copaia and V. guatemalensis. However, in other cases, bene\u00aecial effects on some soil nutrients were noted: for example, increases in soil Ca under T. amazonia and Virola koschnyi, both species with high Ca content in foliage and high rates of annual litterfall. The mixed plots showed intermediate values for the nutrients examined, and even improved soil conditions, as for P in Plantation 1.",

The calculation of whole-stand nutrient budgets can help in the selection of tree species and plantation management strategies to favor nutrient recycling mechanisms and site nutrient conservation.",
        "4588c8fd-e0ef-4e5a-af87-a70eedac1f28": "Tropical tree plantations incorporate considerable amounts of nutrients in their biomass over a relatively Forest Ecology and Management 134 (2000) 257\u00b1270 short period of time (Bruijnzeel, 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994;Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997;Gonc ,alves et al., 1997). Soil nutrients may be generally abundant early in stand growth as a result of low plant uptake, stimulation of nutrient mineralization, and low immobilization in plant biomass, but as plantations grow, decreased nutrient availability can result from immobilization into woody biomass and detritus pools, and decreased mineralization (Binkley, 1986;Binkley et al., 1997). Site fertility declines can limit sustained plantation forestry in tropical regions, especially on soils that are inherently nutrient-poor: soil fertility can be decreased through excessive removal of living biomass, particularly if nutrients in tree crowns are lost through harvest or site preparation (Jorgensen and Wells, 1986;Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997;Wadsworth, 1997). Alternatives to conserve site nutrients may include preferential planting of tree species that do not place high nutrient demands on the site (Bruijnzeel, 1984;Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994). Bruijnzeel (1984) found, for example, a higher production of wood per unit of N or P in the wood in plantations of Pinus merkusii compared with nearby plantations of Agathis damara in Java. Large differences may exist in nutrient use ef\u00aeciency among tropical tree species (Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini, 1994a). For example, in Puerto Rico, Wang et al. (1991) found that Casuarina spp. was twice as ef\u00aecient as Leucaena spp.",

To design viable tropical plantations, focusing on ef\u00aecient use of nutrients on a stand level may be as important as considering production rates (Wang et al., 1991). Mixed plantations yield more diverse forest products than monospeci\u00aec stands, helping to diminish farmer's risks in unstable markets. If planned with consideration for each species' response to mixed conditions, mixed designs can be more productive than monospeci\u00aec systems (Smith, 1986;Binkley et al., 1992;Burkhart and Tham, 1992;Kelty, 1992;Wormald, 1992). In addition, a mixture of species, each with different nutrient requirements and different nutrient recycling properties, may be overall less demanding on site nutrients than pure stands (Binkley et al., 1997;Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997). In this article, above-ground nutrient accumulation and soil chemistry are compared among eight native species growing in young plantations in mixed and pure stands in the Atlantic humid lowlands of Costa Rica. In previous reports, it was shown that the growth of dominant species was faster in mixed than in pure plantation, and that mixed plantations had high volume and biomass production in comparison with pure stands (Montagnini et al., 1993(Montagnini et al., , 1995;;Montagnini and Porras, 1998). In other plantations of the same experiment, the mixed plantations had intermediate values of soil N, P and K, but lower soil Ca and Mg relative to pure plantations (Stanley and Montagnini, 1999). Although the young age of these plantations precludes proper extrapolation over a whole rotation, the results can suggest design and management options of tropical plantations to conserve nutrients in the long term.",

Proper design and management of plantations can increase biomass accumulation rates, making them more effective C sinks. However, fast-growing plantations can extract large amounts of nutrients from the soil, and site fertility declines may limit sustained plantation forestry after a few rotations. We measured aboveground biomass accumulation, carbon sequestration, and soil chemistry in three young plantations of 12 indigenous tree species in pure and mixed designs in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica. Annual biomass increments for the three mixed plantations ranged from 10-13 Mg/ha. The mixtures of four species gave higher biomass per hectare than that obtained by the sum of one fourth hectare of each species in pure plots. At this early age of the plantations, estimated annual C sequestration values were comparable to other reports from young plantations of exotic species commonly grown in the tropics. Four years after planting, decreases in soil nutrients were apparent in pure plots of some of the fastest growing species, while beneficial effects on soils were noted under other species. The mixed plots showed intermediate values for the nutrients examined and, sometimes, improved soil conditions. A mixture of fast and slower growing species yields products at different times, with the slower growing species constituting a longer term sink for fixed carbon. Examination of the role of tropical plantations as C sinks necessitates integrative approaches that consider rates of C sequestration, potential deleterious effects on ecosystem nutrients, and economic, social, and environmental constraints.",

If the trees in the upper canopy are not too dense, they grow more rapidly in diameter than if crowded into the single canopy of a pure plantation; lower-stratum species can influence stem form and self-pruning of upperstratum species in ways similar to that of a pure stand (Burkhart and Tham 1992). In the present research, the dominant species of each plantation grew larger when grown with other species compared to singlespecies plantations. Apparently in the mixtures, the dominant species, with less intraspecific competition, can attain larger diameters, as reported in earlier research (Montagnini and others 1995). Only two of the 12 species tested were seemingly suppressed by the dominant species and thus grew better in pure plots: C. brasiliense (plantation 1) and G. americana (plantation 3). Except in the two cases noted, the other species associated with the faster growing dominants apparently shared resources with the dominant species and had higher biomass of plant parts in mixed than in pure plots. Farmers may prefer species diversification for financial reasons or because of uncertainties about species' performance, scarcity of seedlings, or risks from potential pest damage. Species diversification could be achieved by planting species mixtures or planting a set of monospecific plots. In the three plantations tested, the mixtures always had greater biomass accumulation rates than the sum of each of the component species in pure plots. These results suggest that mixed designs, if planned with consideration for each species' response to mixed conditions, may result in greater production than using the same area of land for pure species stands. The inclusion of faster and relatively slower growing species in a mixture has the additional advantage of providing harvestable products at different rotation times, with the slower growing species (e.g., C. brasiliense, V. ferruginea) producing relatively more valuable wood.",

Additionally, because the different species of the mixture have different rotation lengths, the land is in use for a longer period than if planted with just one fast-growing, short-rotation species (such as J. copaia). This diminishes incentives for changing to other land uses, keeps a vegetative cover that protects the soil, and serves other environmental purposes as well.

In particular, tne plantations and tree-crop combinations represent productive alternatives for uses of deforested lands that have poor regeneration of natural forests due to long distance to sources of propagules or intense site degradation. As the area of degraded lands expands, there is increasing emphasis on the planting of tree species which can grow in such conditions and yield potentially profitable products (timber, fuelwood and other) as well as environmental benefits (soil conservation, watershed protection) (Evans 1987).

(2017) have recently suggested that conversion of native vegetation to agriculture globally has generated a loss of over 100 Pg of SOC. There are, however, large variations in the magnitude of change in SOC. Powers et al. (2011) collated data from 80 studies examining the effect of land-use change in the tropics on SOC and showed that there were significant increases or decreases in 8 of the 14 change categories. The change from forest to pasture resulted in an average increase in SOC mass in the top 10 cm of ~13.7% (standard deviation 28.2, n = 118) and the increase averaged ~4.8% (s.d. 24.1, n = 27) when pasture was converted to plantation. Powers et al. (2011) suggested that mean annual precipitation and clay mineralogy were important controls on the magnitude of the change. Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma (2013) have also demonstrated the very varied response of SOC to land-use change to plantation and successional forests in the tropics, and identified a similar range of variables influencing the SOC. In another meta-analysis, Don et al.

This change in land-use promotes C sequestration in the vegetation, but may decrease or increase the SOC. Silver et al.",

Most of the increases in SOC occurred after 22 years. The changes in SOC result from differences in the input and decomposition of plant litter and roots. Where land-use change involves pastures and trees, identification of changes in the SOC \u03b4 13 C value (based on the 13 C/ 12 C ratio) can be used to calculate the gain and loss of the grass and tree derived SOC. The strong separation of \u03b4 13 C value in forests (dominantly C 3 plants, ~-28\u2030, SOC 3 ) and pastures (dominantly C 4 plants, ~-13\u2030, SOC 4 ), has been successfully used calculate gains and losses. In the Puerto Rico study, for example, Silver et al. (2004) found that in the top 10 cm, the pasture SOC was derived dominantly (83%) from C 3 plants, while after 61 years for tree growth, this was reduced to 29%. Changes in the proportion of C 3 and C 4 -derived SOC can be used to estimate decomposition rates and thus turnover times (e.g. Balesdent and Mariotti 1996). Evaluation of the changes in soil properties brought about land-use can be made either through following the change at one location through time or by substituting space for time in a chronosequence which assumes soil properties were similar before the land-use change (e.g. Davidson and Ackerman 1993;Veldkamp 1994). In both approaches, the large spatial variability in soil properties restricts the attribution of a difference in soil properties to the land-use change (Allen et al. 2016). Thus, some knowledge of the characteristics of the spatial variability of soil properties is needed to adequately define a sampling strategy.",

Its aim was to compare the productivity of mixed-species plantations with monocultures to test whether diversity would enhance productivity and hence C storage (Potvin et al. 2011). This provided an opportunity to examine changes in soil properties, particularly the SOC and soil nitrogen (SN) content and mass, and \u03b4 13 C value associated with land-use changes from pasture to plantation and the effect of plantation species and mixture. In nearby Barro Colorado Island (BCI), an undisturbed forest provided an opportunity to estimate the surface soil properties of a site that may have been similar to the precursor of the Sardinilla pasture. To meet these objectives, we intensively sampled the 0-10 cm layer of the Sardinilla pasture soil in 2001 to establish spatial variability and sampled 7 soil profiles to a depth of 100 cm. We repeated the 0-10 cm sampling in the plantation in 2011 within the experimental diversity design of 7 treatments, at locations close to those sampled in 2001. We also sampled the 0-10 cm layer in the tropical forest soil. Analysis of vegetation from the pasture, the plantation and the tropical forest provided \u03b4 13 C values which combined with the \u03b4 13 C values of the soil allowed an estimate of the contribution of C 3 and C 4 plants in trees and pasture, respectively, to the SOC and the calculation of SOC turnover time.",
        "c435e7b5-c59c-42cc-a4dd-b57ff49bb423": "As anticipated, our study has shown the high degree of spatial variability in soil properties that can occur within short distances even where land use was constant, such as the Sardinilla pasture. Much of the variability occurs at small distances, as shown by the comparison of variability within 1 and 9 m 2 (Table 1) and at a broader scale, the range values are large (Table 2). This is a common phenomenon in soils (e.g. Webster and Oliver 1992) limiting our ability to detect changes associated with variations in land-use across landscapes, in substituting space for time in chronosequences and in conducting longitudinal studies at the same site, as at Sardinilla (e.g. Allen et al. 2016;Powers and Schlesinger 2002). Thus, to be able to detect significant differences in soil properties, a substantial number of replicate soil samples are needed: Allen et al. (2016) suggest 4 to 8 replicates per treatment in a study of land-use change effects in Indonesia. In our study, we took 4 soil samples per 30 \u00d7 30 m treatment plot and each treatment was replicated between 2 and 6 times. The small nugget values across sampling dates and soil properties suggest minimal random measurement errors and smooth spatial continuity between neighbouring points (Vieira and Gonzalez 2003). A low nugget/sill ratio indicates strong spatial correlation. In general, between 2001 and 2011 the variance of the characteristics decreased (except \u03b4 13 C) and range values increased, suggesting an increase in uniformity of the characteristics through time. Changes over time in range values can be attributed to different processes, parameters or structures affecting the soil characteristics (Korres et al. 2015). In this case, the change in the range parameter for N% from 29 to 51 m could reflect an homogenization of the soil, possibly associated with the change from variable grazing in the pasture to a more uniform tree cover.",

(2011) and Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma (2013) for tropical clay-rich forested and plantation soils. The 10 to 17 kg m -2 SOC stored within the 100 cm deep profiles is also similar to the averages of 12 and 16 kg m -2 reported by Powers et al. (2011) and Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma (2013). The shallow rooting in the heavy textured Sardinilla soil prevents large accumulations of C at depth. Several meta analyses have shown the large variability in response of soil organic matter to changes in landuse in the tropics (e.g. Guo and Gifford 2002;Don et al. 2011;Powers et al. 2011;Mar\u00edn-Spiotta and Sharma 2013), resulting from differences in input of plant litter above-and below ground and rates of decomposition in the soil. Variables such as climate, type of land-use change, soil type and duration of change influence the direction and magnitude of changes in SOC. Our estimates of SOC mass change in the change from forest to pasture and pasture to plantation fall within the range of published observations. There are two caveats to our results, however. First, the difference in clay content between the surface BCI forest and Sardinilla soils (35 and 65%, respectively) means that the SOC mass in the former is probably an underestimate of what it would be if the clay content had been 65%; thus the change in SOC mass from forest to pasture (gain of 1.14 kg m -2 ) is likely an overestimate. Second, differences in bulk density of the top 10 cm soil entails the possibility of errors in extracting the same amount of soil under the varying land uses.",

(2011). As noted by Ellert and Bettany (1995), an increase in bulk density when sampled to the same depth could increase the SOC mass. Sampling to a common soil horizon would avoid this problem, but in these tropical soils there is no strong horizon development. The difference in bulk density between the Sardinilla pasture and plantation soils is 0.03 g cm -3 (or 5% of the pasture value) and this may contribute to the observed loss of 18% of SOC. Similarly, the difference in SOC mass between BCI and pasture soils (and increase of 52%) may partially arise from the difference in bulk density of 0.07 g cm -3 (or 14%). While the \u03b4 13 C value in the uppermost layers of the pasture soil is associated with the change of input from forest to pasture (Table 5), the variable increase in \u03b4 13 C value with depth (from averages of -17.5 \u2030 at 0-10 cm to -21.7\u2030 at 90-100 cm) is similar to that reported for pasture soils in BCI (Schwendenmann and Pendall 2006) and Puerto Rico (Mar\u00edn-Spiotta et al. 2009;Silver et al. 2004). There are several possible causes, including differences in the input of C 3 and C 4 plant roots and the root-derived legacy from the forest, as well as differences in the rate of decomposition of organic matter leaving a residue richer in 13 C with a larger \u03b4 13 C value, and DOC percolating down through the profile and being adsorbed on to clay surfaces (see Bostr\u00f6m et al. 2007). However, in none of the pasture profiles does the \u03b4 13 C value increase with depth, as commonly observed under forested soils, nor reach a value associated with organic matter derived from the forest.",

Schwendenmann and Pendall (2006) estimated 69 and 123 yr (0-5 and 5-10 cm depths, respectively) for a 90yr old conversion of forest to pasture in a well-drained soil on BCI, and also demonstrated that the turnover time varied with aggregates in the soil. In Costa Rica, Huth et al. (2012) reported that conversion of forest to pasture resulted in about half of the SOC in the top 40 cm turning over in 40 to 50 yr. Depending on the \u03b4 13 C value ascribed to litter input, Mar\u00edn-Spiotta et al. (2009) estimated turnover times of 40 to 80 yr in the 0-10 cm depth of soils undergoing conversion from pasture to forest in Puerto Rico, and also noted that the turnover time varied among density fractions in the mineral soils. Although considerable attention has been given to the role of biodiversity on litter decomposition (e.g. Handa et al. 2014;H\u00e4ttenschwiler et al. 2005), our results suggest that the litter in the Sardinilla plantation, after 10 years, reflects primarily the speed of decomposition of the leaves of the 5 tree species, especially the fast rate of H. crepitans (Table 5). The biodiversity plots had litter amounts similar to those found under A. excelsum and L. seemanii, which had the slowest rates of litter decomposition (Scherer-Lorenzen et al. 2007). Silver et al.

It may take longer for a soil pattern to develop; we observed significant differences in fine root biomass among the plantation treatments and this may be a major source of SOC and SN, in addition to leaf litter decomposition and incorporation into the soil. Guerrero-Ram\u00edrez et al. (2016) measured rates of root decomposition (over 1.3 yr) at a depth of 20 cm in Sardinilla with k values ranging from with varying from 0.4 to 1.1 yr -1 , considerably slower than the values of 1.3 to 7.3 yr -1 for tree litter (Scherer-Lorenzen et al. 2007). However, the root decomposition rates were unaffected by tree species richness, either by species manipulation within litter bags or as a function of varying tree overstory richness. In 2009, the aboveground biomass in the Sardinilla plantation was estimated to be between 1.8 and 2.3 kg C m -2 , with an increase from mono-specific to 3-and 6-species plots, dominated by the tree cover (Potvin et al. 2011). This contrasts with an estimated aboveground biomass of 10-15 kg C m -2 in the BCI forest (Chave et al. 2003;Leigh et al. 1996) and 0.2 kg C m -2 in the pasture (Wolf et al. 2011).

Soil carbon sequestration following afforestation of agricultural land ranges from losses to substantial annual gains. The present understanding of the controlling factors is inadequate for understanding ecosystem dynamics, modeling global change and for policy decision-makers. Our study found that planting agricultural soils to deciduous forests resulted in ecosystem C accumulations of 2.4 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 and soil accumulations of 0.35 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 . Planting to conifers showed an average ecosystem sequestration of 2.5 and 0.26 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 in the soils but showed greater field to field variability than when planted to deciduous forest. Path analysis showed that Ca was positively related to soil C accumulations for both conifers and deciduous afforested sites and played a significant role in soil C accumulations in these sites. Soil N increases were closely related to C accumulation and were two times greater than could be explained by system N inputs from atmospheric deposition and natural sources. Our results suggest that the addition of Ca to afforested sites, especially conifers, may be an economical means to enhance soil C sequestration even if it does not result in increasing C in aboveground pools. The mechanism of N accumulation in these aggrading stands needs further investigation.",

The evaluation of pool sizes and fluxes, relative to sequestration calculations, requires an understanding of the rates of input and loss from soil systems. It also requires knowledge of the factors controlling soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. Historically, SOM has provided large contributions to atmospheric CO 2 through increased decomposition as a consequence of conversion of native lands to agriculture. The total contributions of CO 2 to the atmosphere from land use change were greater than that from fossil fuels until nearly 1980 (Houghton et al., 1983). Conversion of currently C-depleted soils to CO 2 sinks by afforestation has the potential to mitigate high CO 2 levels for a long enough period for other actions to be taken. Sequestering additional soil C can be achieved through improved management techniques on current agricultural lands and by the transformation of cultivated soils to forest or grassland ecosystems (Guo & Gifford, 2002;Kimble et al., 2003). The C sequestration rates reported for soils following afforestation of agricultural land vary. Post & Kwon's (2000) review of afforestation research on a global basis suggested that the average increase in soil C following afforestation was 0.32 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , but there was a very large range of accumulation rates for temperate forests (\u00c00.141 to 0.617). A review of 43 studies, representing multiple countries, by Paul et al. (2002) also found variable rates of loss or accumulation, with stands younger than 30 years generally losing C and older than 30 gaining minimal amounts in lower horizons. Guo & Gifford (2002) used meta-analysis to evaluate the data available from 74 publications across four countries on soil C stocks associated with a number of different types of land use change.",
        "fbc0d549-edb5-41c5-b009-38b2e5188471": "Their results suggested that conversion of native forest to pasture may increase soil C stocks likely as a consequence of increased root inputs, however, conversion to plantation or agricultural crops decreases soil C. Returning land use from crop to plantation tended to increase C stocks unless the species planted were pine. Most importantly, their study suggested that processes that altered soil C stocks could be reversed if the land was returned to its former use. There is also evidence that even without land use change, old growth forests accumulate C in soils under specific conditions (Zhou et al., 2006). The majority of studies on changes in soil C stocks following land use change have shown relatively small changes to soil C pools, were inconclusive, or showed large gains under a few specific circumstances. Mechanisms for C gain have also been found to vary across sites. Studies have shown increases in aggregation following afforestation to contribute to soil C sequestration (Six et al., 2002). There is also sequestration independent of this mechanism (Del Galdo et al., 2003). There are few solid explanations for the large disparity in results suggesting that our current understanding of C sequestration following afforestation of agricultural land is not adequate (Scho \u00a8ning & Ko \u00a8gel-Knabner, 2006). Belowground resources and storage capacities can be difficult to measure and are, therefore, poorly understood. Understanding the degree to which soils can act as sinks for atmospheric CO 2 necessitates an understanding of both the levels of SOC currently present and the effect of future management and global change such that the C storage dynamics can be predicted. Improving sink status of afforested soils requires elucidation of the control mechanisms for C storage in soils. One key mechanism that may control C storage in forest soils is tree type. Pregitzer & Palik (1997), Richter et al. (1999), Guo & Gifford (2002), Paul et al. (2002), and Paul et al.",
        "e0863141-f2bb-46ec-8f08-59f94d98bf30": "(2002), and Paul et al. (2003) found that afforestation of agricultural land to pine forests resulted in accumulations of C in aboveground biomass but decreases in soil C. However, other studies have found coniferous native sites to have higher soil C levels than associated agricultural land (Johnson, 1992;Ellert & Gregorich, 1996). Hooker & Compton (2003) found increases in aboveground, litter, and deep soil (20-70 cm) C following afforestation with Pinus strobus, yet with no accumulations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Bellamy et al. (2005) found C losses from all soils, suggesting that climate change was already also having an effect on soil C storage. Another key, mechanism that may control C storage in forest soils is nutrient availability. Many plantations, established as a consequence of owner abandonment, erosion control, and other forms of land improvement, were likely established without evaluation or improvement of nutrient status. Soil C accumulation is dependent on organic inputs. Plant production and the rate at which those materials become incorporated and stabilized in soils are a consequence of nutrient availability. Nitrogen availability is essential to maintain high photosynthetic rates. It has multiple controls on decomposition and SOM formation (Fog, 1988). Low tissue C:N ratios increase cellulose decomposition rates, but available N can retard the genetic expression of peroxidase enzymes required for the degradation of aromatics such as lignin (Agren et al., 2001). Nitrogen is also a constituent of SOM and is required for the formation of humic components (Haider, 1992). Other nutrients such as soil cations are important for stabilizing SOM, once it is in soil, against loss through microbial acquisition or leaching (Baldock & Nelson, 2000). The amount of C sequestered depends not only on the maximum capacity of the soil to retain C based on vegetation, climate, and parent material, but also upon the flux into and out of soil pools.",

Many studies have found that site preparation or preplanting management, species composition, and/or site fertility can have interactive effects on SOC dynamics (Johnson, 1992). To evaluate these factors, our research has been designed to compare related sites of differing fertility, soil type, and management history (afforested deciduous, afforested conifer, native deciduous forest, and agricultural fields) to determine both the potential for sequestration and the controls affecting SOM dynamics. The site evaluated in this study is one of an extensive transect of long-term, afforested sites being extensively characterized with physical and biological tests (Six et al., 2002;Paul et al., 2003;Rillig et al., 2003). Its texture, cropping history, and tree growth characteristics make it a near-ideal site for such comparisons. Few studies have conducted the intensive soil, vegetation, bulk density, and soil depth analysis required to evaluate these differences on a landscape basis to determine specific management tools likely to improve C accrual in afforested soils. We examined soil C stocks from an agricultural forest landscape in southern Michigan. Soil C stocks from deciduous and coniferous plantations established on agricultural soils 50-60 years ago were compared with soil C stocks from adjacent, present day, native forest sites and agricultural fields. Soil N and other nutrients were determined so that the controls affecting SOM dynamics could be evaluated. Based on similar agricultural history across our sites, our overall hypothesis was that reestablishing trees on agricultural fields would affect soil C across all sites. We predicted that soil C would increase on all afforested sites when compared to the agricultural site but that different tree species and their associated soil biota would result in different levels of soil C sequestration.",

This is a yearly storage of approximately 0.35 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 in the deciduous and 0.26 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 in the conifers, which is similar to the average of 0.32 Mg ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 found by Post & Kwon (2000) in their review of C storage of afforested sites. It is estimated that US agricultural soils can store 75-208 Tg C yr \u00c01 through improved management practices (Lal et al., 1998). Land-use change and land restoration are estimated to contribute to 20% or 15-42 Tg C yr \u00c01 of the soil C storage under this model. Williams (1989)    of the predicted C gains through changes in agricultural practices (Lal et al., 1998). Ecosystem N also increased in each of the afforested areas studied. It increased from 5.01 Mg N ha \u00c01 in the agricultural fields to 5.58 in the conifers and 6.77 Mg N ha \u00c01 for the afforested deciduous. The conifers represent an increase of 26 kg N ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , whereas the deciduous afforested plots increased by 44 kg N ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 . Average depositional rates of N were determined for this site using precipitation N data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) between 1983 and 1998 at the two stations closest to Russ Forest (NADP, 2000). Total yearly inorganic N deposition in precipitation averaged 6.24 kg ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , 40 miles southwest of Russ Forest, and 7.06 kg ha \u00c01 , 70 miles northeast of Russ Forest. There was a significant increase in NH 4 1 at the southern site over the last 20 years, and trends suggest that deposition rates at Russ Forest were slightly higher than the southern site.",
        "27bd865a-07f1-4134-9f75-38ff3d16cd67": "The overall result is that, even taking these patterns into account, the deposition rates are not nearly high enough to explain the large increases in ecosystem N in these systems. Nonsymbiotic N fixation likely explains at most 5 kg N ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (Knowles & O'Toole, 1975), suggesting that there is an important source of N input and mechanism of N retention operating in the afforested systems that is not operating in the native forest systems. Nitrogen plays a direct role in C sequestration and increased N retention may be increasing C sequestration potential in terrestrial systems. Melillo (1996) predicted that increased N deposition would result in an additional C sequestration of 0.9 Pg C for boreal and temperate system forests. This prediction was based on an N retention efficiency of 100%. Our research suggests the accumulation of N in the deciduous afforested ecosystem (soils 1 biomass) at Russ Forest is much greater than can be accounted for by our estimates of wet deposition alone. Estimates of dry deposition in the United States are usually less than wet deposition (Boyer et al., 2002) so even doubling N deposition rates at this site does not account for N accrual. This suggests that there is additional N available to an aggrading system that is not accounted for by total deposition numbers alone, either because local scale N availabilities differ from broader scale NADP values or because wet deposition cannot be used to adequately predict total wet and dry deposition for a given area. These are important results as the amount N-stimulated C sequestration on deciduous afforested sites is likely a great deal higher than that predicted by Melillo (1996). There are a number of sources of N in a predominantly agricultural setting. We found no indication in the available planting records of fertilizer application at time of planting; however, application would have likely balanced removal of available N by the previous years crop. As there were few obvious contributors to N fixation in the deciduous vs.",
        "09966be3-3145-4a61-9815-ce31407fede4": "As there were few obvious contributors to N fixation in the deciduous vs. coniferous afforested sites, such as N-fixing plants, we postulate that the N we measured came from absorption of inorganic N in such forms as ammonium or NO x from industrial and agricultural atmospheric sources. These data support the findings of Bormann et al. (2002) that suggest unexplained N additions likely occur, however, Binkley et al. (2000) found few studies that provide data to support 'occult inputs of N' and suggested that studies that better control for inputs and losses from systems should be undertaken. That our sites currently have greater N in deciduous afforested sites than adjacent agricultural soils, and significant aboveground biomass was produced over the last 50 years, suggest significant N inputs. As greater N retention was detected only in the deciduous afforested soils, these soils likely have a greater overall sequestration potential than the afforested coniferous sites on this landscape. Mechanisms for large amounts of N accrual should be further investigated on these and other aggrading sites. The Russ Forest study represents a detailed study of C and N storage at a single site. Extensive studies of other sites, using the same methodologies, also showed increases in N content following land-use change (Paul et al., 2003). At these sites the C:N ratio of the afforested deciduous soils was more similar to that of agricultural fields than that of the adjacent deciduous native site. Nitrogen is required for plant growth and increased residue inputs. It is a constituent of both labile and stable SOM and is required for SOM stabilization. The availability of N in the soil has been linked to both increased and decreased SOM decomposition rates (Fog, 1988). This is likely a consequence of two factors. First, although available N will increase cellulose, decomposition it can inhibit lignin decomposition (Boominathan & Reddy, 1992).",
        "7bcad280-e39d-4ca1-b457-45b6550d32e6": "Secondly, N is a component of SOM, which in its humified form can have a C:N ratio of 8 : 1, suggesting N availability will help build stable organic matter (Haider, 1992). Studies that examined N additions to forest soils suggested that 50-83% of the N additions accumulated in the long-term, recalcitrant pool (Magill et al., 1997). There is also a concern that N saturation may eventually occur in the afforested systems resulting in the ecosystem health problems described in the acid forest soil literature resulting from concomitant soil acidification and Al solubility problems in areas of excess N deposition (Aber et al., 1991). Changes to soil C pools across the landscape at Russ Forest are dependent on N acquisition and on use by plants and microbes. The low C:N ratio of the afforested deciduous site suggests C sequestration will continue; however, long-term additions on the native site may have detrimental long-term effects. Differences in total profile C and N detected among the farms sampled in this study demonstrate that management has large impacts on C and N sequestration in agriculture. These differences also impact our C and N sequestration estimates for afforestation. We are likely underestimating the amount of C and N stored since afforestation. The assumption was made that present agricultural land was representative in SOM contents of the land that was planted in the 1940s. Soil C losses from agriculture have stabilized since the 1960's higher yielding crops, increased plant residue return, and better tillage practices (Flach et al., 1997). It is probable that soil C and N contents were lower in all farms in the 1940s when these areas were replanted. Afforestation of agricultural lands implemented as part of a policy for C sequestration should increase terrestrial C storage. Agricultural practices alter soils and this historical legacy affects tree establishment and ultimately soil C sequestration. The agricultural soils in our study had greater cation content than the native or afforested sites. Nutrient status at the time of planting is important for tree growth and may have important consequences for soil C stabilization.",
        "17e366ad-d694-4f23-9ec7-8fa3097d0b73": "On our sites, Ca content varied greatly across the afforested sites. While the conifers appeared to have greater Ca content than the deciduous sites, this reflects the influence of one high Ca stand. It is likely that the Ca content on this site was much larger at the time of tree establishment than on other conifer or deciduous sites. The relationships of C to soil cations, N and P detected in this study suggest that additions of Ca even at the moderate levels used in agriculture and fertilizing at time of tree planting can have large impacts on C sequestration. Management recommendations for species and fertility levels should be included as part of policy recommendations to maximize C sequestration. Our data indicate that for areas such as Russ Forest, it should not be necessary to fertilize with N. Deposition and absorption rates for this site should provide ample N for accrual in biomass. Cation additions, however, may be necessary. Carbon storage in the conifers was particularly sensitive to soil nutrient status and soils with low calcium had low soil C content (Fig. 2). While the relationships detected for conifers were driven by the high Ca site, Paul et al. (2003) also showed strong Ca to C interactions on a number of other coniferous sites using similar analyses. The afforested deciduous sites also had increases in C with Ca; however, overall they had more consistent accumulations in C across sites compared to pines. While we have detected relationships between Ca and C, it is not possible to demonstrate causality. There is a great deal of support for the concept that the availability of Ca in soils alters C accumulation and stabilization. The role of Ca in ecosystem dynamics and soil C storage and turnover (Fig. 3) has long been discussed in classic soils literature (Jenny, 1941;Kononova, 1966). More recent work on SOM dynamics (Baldock & Nelson, 2000;Clough & Skjemstad, 2000) further highlight, the importance of Ca in stabilization of SOM. Reich et al.",
        "3473d91b-5779-46a6-806e-48fc0c1775bd": "Reich et al. (2005) demonstrated that tree species differentially affect soil Ca content through differences in litter Ca and these differences are apparent within 30 years of tree establishment. Calcium is therefore important to include in management strategies designed for forest plantations on disturbed soil systems. A literature review of 18 experiments with Ca additions of 5-10 ton CaCO 3 ha \u00c01 (Popovic & Andersson, 1984) showed a general decline in aboveground tree growth during the initial 10-15 years after liming with slight (non-significant) increases thereafter. Liming caused more root growth but less mycorrhizal abundance in the humus layer. This was thought to possibly decrease tree growth due to enhanced moisture stress during dry periods. (Persson, 1988a). Further experiments on the biology of liming (Persson, 1988b) found greater N immobilization in needle litter materials with liming. It was suggested that increased N was incorporated into SOM either as NH 3 or as N-rich microbial products that also stabilized soil C. Afforestation of agricultural soils can provide a very large sink for atmospheric CO 2 , both in the vegetation and in the soil. Good estimates of soil C change resulting from afforestation are difficult to acquire and necessitate an understanding of the changes that land-use change has on the ecosystems studied. Agriculture alters bulk density, horizon depth, and movement of C, N, cations and P throughout the soil profile. Understanding changes in soil C dynamics with land-use change requires an incorporation of bulk density and horizon depth information and requires reporting values on an aerial basis to depth. Reporting C and N changes without incorporating this essential informa-tion will obscure real changes in ecosystem dynamics. Extrapolating from our site to estimate C accrual in the eastern deciduous region is not as valuable as the identification of the key controls on C accumulation in these sites. Evaluating key controllers of C dynamics and estimating both the total greenhouse gas balance and the economics following land-use change are essential for determining the benefits of afforestation for policy decisions.",
        "bdb08587-7046-4b97-8f1b-71e55dbf92ee": "Tropical forests are expected to play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change and achieving the global temperature rise target set as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Indeed, tropical forests are crucial systems for regulating the climate and mitigating climate change (Baccini et al., 2017;Griscom et al., 2020;Sullivan et al., 2020). These forests can sequester up to 30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and represent at least 59% of global carbon stocks (Yguel et al., 2019). They store approximately 470 billion tonnes of CO 2 in above and below ground biomass (Pan et al., 2011, Huntingford et al., 2013;Pugh et al., 2019). Interest in tropical forests specifically is therefore thoroughly justified since they are the ecosystems with the most potential for storing additional terrestrial carbon (Griscom et al., 2020). On the other hand, one of the greatest sources of greenhouse gas emissions stems from the tropical deforestation (Griscom et al., 2020). These ecosystems display greater and more rapid changes in land use than any other ecosystem, as a result of anthropogenic deforestation and degradation (Chazdon et al., 2016;Poorter et al., 2016;Mitchard, 2018). Net decreases in the area of tropical forests were enormous during the decade 2010-2020, mainly in Africa (3.9 million ha) and South America (2.6 million ha) (FAO, 2020). Deforestation leads to numerous sources of emissions as well as cryptic sources that occur more gradually and include the edge effect in fragmented forests (Maxwell et al., 2019). Newly accessible forests will be earmarked for a first selective conventional logging, which could result in substantial carbon emissions (Pearson et al., 2014;Maxwell et al., 2019).",
        "c74c8438-06bb-4afe-bda7-9185f2ca9c32": "Conventional selective logging in tropical forests for timber and/or fuelwood is usually a source of forest degradation, since the loss of live biomass as a result of harvesting practices is, in general, greater than the accumulation of biomass through regrowth over many years (Pearson et al., 2014). The loss of biomass is mainly related to damage caused by the felling of harvested trees, incidental damage to neighbouring trees and damage caused by unplanned log extraction (Pearson et al., 2014). This study, therefore, focuses on how selective logging affects the mitigation potential of tropical production forests. More specifically, we are interested in sustainable logging and its impact on biomass storage in tropical production forests. Various improved reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques have been developed. They seek to balance environmental protection with timber production in tropical production forests. RIL, in addition to mitigating the damage caused by log extraction reduces the loss of carbon stocks in the remaining vegetation, thereby providing a natural climate solution (Ellis et al., 2019). Natural climate solutions are made up of discrete and quantifiable actions that avoid the emission of greenhouse gases or increase carbon sequestration in forests, savannah, agricultural lands and wetlands (Griscom et al., 2020). In this context, many studies have reported that RIL in tropical forests could eventually reduce carbon emissions equivalent to 29-50% of the net emissions caused by tropical deforestation and changes in land use (Cerullo and Edwards, 2019;Sasaki et al., 2016). Moreover, the relatively small net emission of CO 2 by RIL hides the high potential for CO 2 storage in the form of biomass (Houghton et al., 2015). Our research seeks to contribute knowledge about the potential of sustainable management for maintaining carbon storage in timber production forests. We specifically study above-ground biomass (AGB) storage in timber production forests submitted to sustainable logging techniques.",
        "0a3f9a6a-d51e-4dc0-be2b-bc7e314695ef": "Knowing more about AGB storage in timber production forests will enable sustainable logging to be promoted as a natural climate solution in the tropics, where only a small area of forest is currently subject to sustainable management (FAO, 2020). Comparing biomass stocks in recovering timber production forests with those of primary forests (forests with no known recent human intervention) makes it possible to demonstrate how logging impacts carbon storage. The current research applies to primary rain forests in Costa Rica, where sustainable forest management and forest conservation take place on private farms within a landscape matrix that is highly fragmented (e. g. Schedlbauer et al., 2007;Morse et al., 2009). Costa Rica is one the rare, if not the only tropical country that reports a net gain of forest cover, mainly through natural regeneration. Forest cover represented 52.38% of the national territory (REDD/CCAD-GIZ Program, 2015;Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez et al., 2017). However, as more generally in Central American countries, between the 1950s and the 1990s, Costa Rica went through an intensive process of deforestation, during which land suitable for forestry was stripped of its forest cover, with as much as 18,000-42,000 ha reportedly deforested annually. The country reached its climax of deforestation in the 1980s. Deforestation was mainly caused by land use changes following conversion to agricultural and pastoral uses. Non sustainable logging activities were also an important degradation factor, opening up tropical primary forest and leading to deforestation. To encourage forest recovery, from the 1990s the Costa Rican government established various incentives for natural forest management. To this end, Forestry Law No. 7575 was passed in the late 1990s to \"safeguard the conservation, protection and management of natural forests as well as the production, exploitation, industrialisation and stimulation of the country's forestry resources to that end\" (Costa Rica, 1996). In Article 19, the Law establishes that in areas declared as forest, conversion to agriculture, livestock or other uses is prohibited.",
        "d887cd3e-3a91-451e-9f6e-40e591066794": "This prohibition discouraged deforestation. Moreover, the law introduced sustainable forest management in Article 20, with the aim of mitigating degradation from logging activities. The law therefore stipulates that natural forest can be exploited for timber production but only when there is a management plan that curbs the impact that logging may cause to the environment. Therefore, in Costa Rica, any natural forest (outside of protected areas) which is exploited for timber production is subject to forest management, with the condition that it must follow a strict legal framework focusing on forest integrity and ecological sustainability, which is defined in a detailed management plan. The management plan must be submitted and approved by the National System of Conservation Areas (Sistema Nacional de \u00c1reas de Conservaci\u00f3n, SINAC), an institution of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy (Ministerio de Ambiente y Energ\u00eda, MINAE). The management plan will be approved if it meets sustainable management criteria, and therefore must include an assessment of the possible impact of logging, with specific reference to the impact on residual mass and soil, as well as the corresponding mitigation measures (MINAE, 1997). In this paper, the term sustainable management therefore refers to the criteria for sustainability established in Costa Rica's forestry legislation, which include appropriate planning of trunk extraction routes, training of workers in tree fall directionality, and also a methodology for calculating felling intensity based on forest censuses. Under this scheme, the Costa Rica Forest Ecosystems Observatory (Observatorio de Ecosistemas Forestales de Costa Rica, OEFo) was set up, with its main aim to evaluate the status and dynamics of forest ecosystems according to their level of disturbance and to build knowledge about the ecosystem services that they provide. In pursuit of these aims, the member institutions of the OEFo network established permanent sampling plots in experimental management units of tropical primary forest, both managed for timber production (following sustainable forest management as defined by Costa Rica's forestry legislation) and intact (not subjected to any forest management plan), in various locations throughout the country.",

For this paper, the estimate was calculated from data collected for the period 2000-2015 (Appendix 1). We also examined the relationship between AGB stock and i) the spatial distribution of the plots, ii) climate variables, and iii) soil variables. To conclude, we discuss the results, focusing on the potential of sustainable management as a natural climate solution, through potential for storage of AGB in forests managed for timber production.",

They act as a carbon sink that varies from year to year and can revert, becoming a source of carbon in drought years or as a result of anthropic disturbances. Monitoring and evaluation of current carbon stocks in biomass in disturbed tropical forests is important for understanding their contribution to climate change mitigation. Several studies involving monitoring of field plots show large variations in carbon sequestration and storage which could be related to the degree of previous disturbance (Poorter et al., 2016, Mitchard, 2018). The objective of our study was to characterise the AGB of Costa Rican forests, determine whether AGB in production forests is different from that in primary forest, and to determine the effects of spatial and environmental variables on AGB. We found that plot spatial distribution was the factor that best explained variability in biomass, followed by soil fertility. Climate variables were shown to have no effect. These results are based on 290,000 measurements of trees from 141 plots which were enumerated up to seven times in a period of 15 years. The quantity of biomass in a forest determines the potential quantity of carbon (1 Mg of biomass = 0.5 Mg of carbon) (Brown and Lugo, 1992) that has been sequestered from the atmosphere and stored. On this basis, between 2000 and 2015 the intact primary forests studied in this research would have stored on average 148.15 Mg ha -1 C and production forests, 164.65 Mg ha -1 C.",
        "3a2e11d7-9d90-4e95-ab10-2268a8055554": "Andean alder (Alnus acuminata) is a tree species often used in revegetation programs in the Colombian Andes, because it is native to the area and grows rapidly even in nitrogen-poor soils. Previous work implied that Andean alder plantings might not lead to as rich a diversity of native vegetation as would natural regeneration. At Ucumar\u0131 \u00b4Regional Park in the Central Andes of Colombia, 30-year-old alder plantations are juxtaposed to naturally regenerated forests of the same age. This study quantifies the impact of Andean alder on plant species composition and forest structure, compared to natural regeneration. Plantations and naturally regenerated forests differed in physiognomy, species composition and in some structural aspects. Alder plantations produced an even 20 m tall canopy. The foliage was vertically stratified into two distinct strata separated by a gap that exposed the boles. The naturally regenerated forest had an uneven 16-18 m tall canopy, vertically continuous foliage cover and significantly higher canopy cover. In both forest types, basal area and stem density were equivalent and distributed among size classes in the same way. Snags in naturally regenerated forests were thicker, perhaps offering a better resource base to organisms using this resource. Plantations had up to one-third fewer species per unit than naturally regenerated forests. Plantations showed a low alpha and beta diversity, with lower species turnover from plot to plot. Qualitatively, the vegetation in the plantations was distinct from that in naturally regenerated forests, as it was composed of a particular subset of species. Approximately one-fourth of species in plantations were exclusive to that forest type. The same patterns were found in the understorey vegetation (1.3-10 m high), where alder is not recruited. This suggests that these patterns are not an artifact of numerical abundance of alder, but rather that alder actually has an effect on species composition. Although alder may create a forest cover in a shorter time, natural regeneration might be a better strategy for the recovery and conservation of biodiversity as long as a propagule source is available. Presence of both forest types, however, may increase species richness and spatial heterogeneity at the landscape level.",
        "1b15e908-77d3-4cfb-afe3-39ab1bf92238": "The transformation from forest to pastures usually takes a few weeks. Reversing that process, however, may take several decades (Saldarriaga et al., 1988). To that purpose, two basic strategies may be followed. The simplest involves removing the agent that is causing the perturbation (fire, cattle, crops) and allowing natural succession to run its course. This requires certain minimum conditions to be successful, i.e. a little disturbed or weathered soil and a soil seed bank and/ or proximity to a seed source such as a nearby forest. The alternative strategy consists of artificially sowing seeds or planting seedlings of one or more species that would ideally act as catalysts of succession (Uhl, 1988). These catalyst species rapidly create favorable conditions for the establishment of seedlings and attract seed dispersers that might bring propagules from nearby seed sources (McDonnell and Stiles, 1983;Parrotta, 1993). Planting trees might be the best strategy when the soil has been severely disturbed (Parrotta et al., 1997) or requires stabilization, and when the seed bank has been completely exhausted and seed sources are distant. Andean alder (Alnus acuminata) is a tree frequently used for restoring vegetation cover of slopes and watersheds in the Colombian Central Andes. Several traits make Andean alder an ideal species for this purpose. Alnus acuminata (hereafter referred to as Andean alder) is native to the Colombian Andes. Its wind-dispersed seeds germinate rapidly. It grows rapidly, up to 8 m in the first 2 years (Carlson and Dawson, 1985). Because of their association with nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes (Frankia sp.), Alnus species establish readily under nitrogen-poor conditions (Larcher, 1977), such as waterlogged, acid, young, or arid soils (Etherington, 1982). Finally, Andean alder has been shown to increase crop production when planted as an overstorey tree (Peden et al., 1993).",

These characteristics would make alder ideal as a catalyst of secondary succession and forest recovery. A previous study showed that a 0.1 ha plot in a 15year-old Andean alder plantation had one-half the species of an equivalent plot of the same age in a nearby naturally regenerated forest (Cavelier, 1993). These preliminary results raise two questions. (1) Is Andean alder an appropriate catalyst for accelerating the recovery of a forest for the purpose of conserving biological diversity? (2) Is the difference between alder plantations and naturally regenerated forests maintained over time? In this paper the species composition and structural complexity of 30-year-old alder plantations and adjacent naturally regenerated forests of the same age are compared. The differences between the two forest types are quantified, some factors that may determine these differences are explored and some implications for forest recovery and conservation of biological diversity are discussed. The final objective is to assess the potential value of Andean alder as a catalyst species for forest restoration in the Colombian Andes.",

Commitment to various global obligations like UNCCD and SDG-15 to achieve land degradation neutrality, sustainable land management and enhanced resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems requires concerted efforts at national, regional and local levels. In view of strengthening the efforts towards achieving the land neutrality the present study attempts to provide the status of 8 restoration sites located across sub-tropical to temperate region of Pithoragarh and Champawat districts in west Himalaya, which now contributes to ex-situ and in-situ biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil conservation and sustenance of local inhabitants, etc. The results of survival percentage revealed that most of the species planted at Jajut site showed better survival with an average of 69% as compared to Digtoli (59%) and Naikina (62%) after 3 years of plantation. Quercus leucotrichophora showed maximum survival percentage (72%) at all the sites followed by Q. glauca (63%), whereas minimum survival (49%) was observed in Zanthoxylum armatum at Naikina site. At Champawat site, height of all planted species increased significantly (p < 0.05) in 2021 as compared to 2011. The carbon stock value increased from 40.02 Mg ha -1 in 2011-65.53 Mg ha -1 in 2021. Increase in carbon stock and carbon sequestration in restoration areas over past 10 years shows higher potential of native species for carbon storage and prospective role of restoration sites in long term carbon sink. The study also attempts to bring the results of restoration activities, implications and benefits to draw some prescription to support the policy and practice interface.

Multiple International initiatives such as United Nations Framework for Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Convention on Biological diversity (CBD), Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) has been started with the aim to address climate change mitigation, landscape degradation and biodiversity conservation (Parrotta et al., 2012;Stanturf et al., 2015;Mansourian and Parrotta, 2019;Stanturf, 2021). However, degradation is not being stopped and this has serious consequences on the land use change, and thereby habitat destruction. This has also been highlighted in the IPBES global report 2019 (D\u00edaz et al., 2019), where land use change has been considered a major driver for the biodiversity loss. It has been estimated that during the past 300 years, the terrestrial ecosystem has transitioned from mostly wild to anthropogenic (Ellis et al., 2010), agriculture expansion has been increased and considered leading cause of land use change, and this has directly impacted on the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services (Davison et al., 2021). In addition, various other factors such as invasion of alien species (Pathak et al., 2019;Rai, 2021), unsustainable felling (Pandey, 2008;Bawa et al., 2020), climate change (Talukder et al., 2021), developmental activities such as infrastructure, hydropower dams, road network etc. further accelerated land degradation. Estimate suggest that the biodiversity of terrestrial communities has declined on average by more than one-fifth (Hill et al., 2018) and the global biomass of vegetation has halved (Erb et al., 2018).

Land use change can have a remarkable effect on ecosystem carbon contents. Such changes are important from the viewpoint of soil fertility and long-term sustainability, and their influence on atmospheric CO 2 and global warming (Bouwman, 1990). Reforestation can capture significant amounts of atmospheric carbon, and it is expected to contribute to soil quality and conservation (Schroeder, 1992). However, the effects of tree species composition, developmental stage, soil type, and management practices on forest ecosystem carbon storage should not be neglected (Cannell, 1982;Harmon et al., 1990;Dewar and Cannell, 1992;Grigal and Ohmann, 1992;Yang et al., 2005). To understand the effects of tree species composition on forest carbon storage, it is necessary to examine carbon pools and their allocation patterns in different ecosystems to determine the most appropriate reforestation species.

The difference is believed to result from species selection during reforestation. M. macclurei is a broadleaved species and the carbon dioxide fixing capacity of a deciduous forest is generally higher than that of a coniferous forest (Zhou et al., 2000). There exists no significant difference for the carbon storage of understory between the M. macclurei and C. lanceolata plantations. However, the biomass of understory and forest floor in M. macclurei plantation is significant high than that in C. lanceolata plantation. Soil was the main carbon pool for the two forest types. The difference in soil carbon storage in the different forest ecosystems are believed to result from the root biomass and litter production. Root biomass and litter production constitute important factors affecting the soil organic carbon. The large root biomass and litter production in M. macclurei plantation enhanced its soil organic carbon contents. Broadleaved tree species increase litter production and nutrient returns, and are helpful to restore soil fertility of degraded monoculture forests (Wang et al., 2008). The changes in the carbon stocks of the soils in the different forest types might also reflect the differences in quantity and quality of above-and below-ground litter inputs, litter carbon decay (Mo et al., 2002), and root biomass carbon. Yang et al. (2004c) noted that the leaf-litter of Chinese fir possesses higher lignin concentration and lignin/N ratio than that of broad leaf tree.",
        "775528e7-9c83-4cba-b930-da93130b8d1c": "In addition, broadleaved trees may allocate more biomass to their roots, especially the fine roots at the shallow soil horizons, which can fix a greater amount of carbon and transfer more root detritus to the top soil (Yang et al., 2004a(Yang et al., , 2004b)).",

Despite the importance of tree size distribution to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone restoration for between 16 and 53 years after planting tree seedlings and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests presented 83% greater abundance of large trees (> 20 cm DBH), 41% lower abundance of saplings (1 \u2264 DBH < 5 cm) and 43% lower abundance of small trees (5 \u2264 DBH < 10 cm). The abundance of smaller individuals (DBH < 1 cm), however, did not differ between restored and reference forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low mortality in the large class (DBH \u2265 20 cm) results in excess of big trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes. 2018), the provision of ecosystem services (Chaves et al., 2015), and more generally the extent of ecosystem sustainability (Ruiz-Ja\u00e9n and Aide, 2005a).Planting nursery-raised tree seedlings has been the most widely used technique for forest restoration (Holl, 2012;Lamb et al., 2005).",

Restoration of tropical forests is particularly challenging because of their high diversity (Garcia et al., 2016) and the complexity of the interactions within their communities (Souza and Batista, 2004). Recovering the resilience and self-sustainability of ecosystems depends on re-establishing features such as vegetation structure, which has been considered a good indicator of restoration success (Ruiz-Ja\u00e9n and Aide, 2005;Wortley et al., 2013). Forest structure reflects successional trajectories (Ruiz-Ja\u00e9n and Aide, 2005;Suganuma and Durigan, 2015), other ecological processes (Trujillo-Miranda et al., 2009;Holl and Aide, 2011). Planting tree seedlings in high densities has been recommended to promote rapid canopy closure (Holl, 2012). Despite the benefits of this technique, its long-term consequences for forest structure, especially tree size distribution, has received little attention. It is assumed that high-density planting will lead to a selfthinning process that ultimately establishes the canopy structure of reference forests, compatible with the carrying capacity of the site (Begon et al., 2006). However, there is a risk that high-density planting leads to a persistent excess of canopy trees that has long-term consequences for tree populations and habitat structure through asymmetric competition with the midstorey and understorey (Begon, 1984;Weiner and Thomas, 1986;Jones et al., 2015). Monitoring and identifying differences in stand structure between restored and native forests are crucial for re-thinking restoration techniques that have been widely applied, and also for adaptive management (Holling, 1978;Walters, 1986;Williams, 2011) of forests undergoing restoration.",

We aimed to answer the following question: does the size structure of restored forests match that of reference native forests? We aimed specially to assess if there are enough young trees recruiting in the understory to replace the planted ones in the future, ensuring self-sustainability of these forests (Zambrano et al., 2014). On the basis of previous studies in the Atlantic forest showing tree basal area, biomass and carbon storage of the oldest restored forests surpassing by far the reference ecosystems (Melo and Durigan, 2006;Miranda Neto et al., 2012;Suganuma and Durigan, 2015), we expected an excess of big trees and a lack of juveniles in planted when compared to native forests, an issue that has not been addressed.",
        "61990daf-d764-455a-81f2-80e30097e338": "The size-class distribution of trees has an important role in successional processes in forests. Thus, comparing size structure of restored and reference forests is crucial for assessing restoration success, as well as for the identification of possible factors driving restored forests to undesired trajectories. The restored forests in our study were old enough to have an abundant and diversified understorey, resulting from seed dispersal through the landscape and reproduction of the planted trees (Butler et al., 2008;Sansevero et al., 2011). Indeed, we found a high density of young trees regenerating in the smaller size class, not differing from the reference forests. Large and bidirectional differences were observed, however, in larger size classes, with strong implications for forest dynamics. Our findings shed light on the structural attributes of restored forests and point out a new perspective about barriers impairing succession and self-sustainability of these ecosystems. We found no differences among the three reference forests in any size class. The absence of differences in this case shall be seen with caution, because it can be related to the low number of replicates and, at least for the smaller size class, variance is large. We did not find difference either in total abundance of individuals (all size classes together) between restored and reference forests and this overall comparison leads to the hasty conclusion that the target structure was reached. Striking size-class differences emerged, however, when we compared restored and reference forests. While the abundance ratio between classes 1 \u2264 DBH < 5 cm and DBH \u2265 20 cm in restored forests is 5:1, in the reference forests it averaged 16:1. The ratio between individuals in classes DBH < 1 cm and 1 \u2264 DBH < 5 cm in restored forests is 3:1, whereas in reference forests it is 2:1. This means the stock of young trees available to replace overstory trees in restored forests in the future is lower than expected. There is an excess of large trees in old restored forests, despite substantial time since planting and high planting densities, which we expected to lead to density-dependent mortality.",
        "5292fb98-7e6a-4c4c-8d5b-5ba8f39140be": "Tree density of planted individuals in restored forests is expected to decrease over time (Sansevero et al., 2011) due primarily to self-thinning (Osawa and Allen, 1993;Jones et al., 2015;Norden et al., 2015). However, our findings suggest self-thinning has not occurred or it has occurred at rates lower than expected in the restored forests. Planting slow-growth and long-lived species in high density is likely the explanation for both absence/delay on gap dynamics and the excess of basal area and biomass in old restored forests when compared to reference forests, as has been observed also in other studies (Melo and Durigan, 2006;Miranda Neto et al., 2012;Suganuma and Durigan, 2015). Our results suggest that a lack of saplings is widespread in old restored forests. The largest disparity in abundance is in the 1 \u2264 DBH < 5 cm class, but we did not observe significant differences in the smallest size class. This is evidence that competition posed by overabundant large trees is not hampering colonization or establishment of seedlings from the planted trees, but rather that it is hindering recruitment to larger size classes. Seeds arrive, germinate and form the seed and seedling bank, which wait for gap openings to develop, just like in native tropical forests (Brokaw, 1985). The factors impairing recruitment are those driving the size structure of these restored communities instead of those limiting seeds arrival and germination. We suggest that low light availability is the major factor behind the low abundance of saplings and young trees in old restored forests (Dupuy and Chazdon, 2008), but other essential resources such as water and nutrients might also be limiting (Lewis and Tanner, 2000;Poorter, 2005). The excess of big trees is the most plausible barrier for recruitment in the restored forests, what characterizes asymmetric competition (Weiner, 1990). High density at planting (above 2000 individuals ha -1 in most of our study sites), reinforced by low mortality, probably have intensified asymmetric competition.",

Although this relationship can be the opposite for young Difference estimates are presented at model scale (log-link) and significant differences (\u03b1 = 0.05) are presented in bold. stands of Atlantic forest undergoing restoration (Brancalion et al., 2019), which are still far from reaching the biomass of reference forests in the same region (Melo and Durigan, 2006), our study corroborates the pattern which has been observed for old restored-forests. In fact, plant-plant interactions are expected to change over time in ecosystems undergoing restoration. Facilitation drives the community assembly in the first years, under abiotic stress, but competition becomes the major filter long term, after the stress filter being surpassed (Wagner, 2004). Though our study encompassed a large number of restored and reference sites, comparison of our results with those from other studies has been limited due to the lack of standardization in tree size classes. We argue that a standardization of division in size classes for monitoring structure of ecosystems undergoing restoration and comparing with the whole range of reference sites would provide basis for a broad and inclusive understanding of restoration outcomes and evidence-based solutions for widespread problems. The empty midstory has been noticed by policy makers, scientists and practitioners, all in search for self-sustainability of restored forests. In sites where density and/or richness of the understory are below the expected, enrichment planting has been recommended as a possible solution (Bertacchi et al., 2016;Yeong et al., 2016). However, enrichment can be not effective in sites where elevated tree biomass and overstory density are constraining recruitment. In such cases, cutting trees is likely to be a better solution (Olson et al., 2014), since it reduces competition and increases availability of resources (Huffman et al., 2017).",
        "06d6704c-a2f3-41f9-9731-27e15766efd4": "As part of an adaptive management plan, careful thinning of the overstory may enhance recruitment and understory development and accelerate the recovery of desired stand structures. How to avoid the negative consequences of overstory trees in excess should be considered also when planning forest restoration. Despite the advantages of planting trees in high density to control weed infestation (Holl et al. 2017), the negative consequences long term should not be disregarded. Planting in low density or increasing the proportion of short-lived species could potentially minimize the structural differences between restored and reference forests in the future. Regarding the future of these forests undergoing restoration without management intervention, we cannot predict how long self-thinning will take to start. Gap opening turnover ranges from 80 to 136 years in tropical forests (Denslow, 1987;Hartshorn, 1978), so a long wait might be expected. When self-thinning occurs, mortality of large trees will result in carbon emissions by decaying dead trees larger than carbon storage by recruitment, creating a temporary negative carbon balance (Lewis et al., 2011;Sist et al., 2014). Over this period, therefore, restored forests can function as carbon sources instead of carbon sinks until they reach the carbon steady state of the native forests in the same region (Houghton et al., 1983).",

This study assessed the performance of an important indigenous species, Khaya grandifoliola, in pure and in mixed stands, and compared its performance to the exotic tree species, T. grandis. The results from the study indicated that after 4 years, there was a significant difference in the diameter of K. grandifoliola (P = 0.001) between pure and mixed stands with the pure stands having an average diameter of 9.15 \u00b1 0.19 cm compared with 7.81 \u00b1 0.33 cm for mixed stands.

K. grandifoliola wood is exported from West African countries (e.g. Ghana) in mixed consignments with other Khaya spp., particularly Khaya anthotheca (Welw.). Until the 1950s Khaya timber formed up to 70 % of the total export from Ghana, with an annual volume of approximately 100,000 m 3 (Opuni-Frimpong 2008), but since then its export has steadily declined (Opuni-Frimpong 2008). The high demand for Khaya spp. resulted from its appealing characteristics, including its pinkish to dark brown colour and physical properties which make it fairly easy to work with, and the fact that the wood finishes well and takes polish (Dunisch and Ruhmanm 2006;Hung and Trueman 2011) which resulted in the over-exploitation of these species, consequently contributing to deforestation in Ghana. The Ministry of Lands and Forestry (1996) reported that one of the priorities of the government of Ghana was to curb the high rate of deforestation by establishing 200,000 hectares of forest plantations of fast growing indigenous and exotic species in pure and in mixed stands. Since then, successful plantations in Ghana have been limited to exotic trees species with vast majority of the plantations as monocultures, despite efforts towards establishment of indigenous species plantations (Agyeman 2004;Foli et al. 2009). The lack of interest in the use of indigenous species for large scale plantations establishment in Ghana has been attributed mainly to high vulnerability to pest infestations and diseases (Foli et al. 2009). Increasingly fewer valuable native tree species are being used in plantations, including mahogany species, even to the point of their elimination as the exotic species appeal as candidate species for plantations soar.",

Elliot and Pleydell (1992) reported that despite the decline of mahoganies in West Africa, demand for African mahogany is anticipated to increase further as a result of reduced supply of native mahogany timber from Southeast Asia and South America. An increase in demand will threaten the viability and sustainability of mahoganies in areas where significant volumes of these species are still found. There is therefore a growing interest in mahogany plantation development on areas where significant portions of forest cover have been lost, with interested stakeholders including the government, NGOs, farmers and other research institutions. In the wake of plantation development, Kanowski et al. (2005) and Piotto et al. ( 2004) have reported that there is continued interest in mixed-species plantations amongst landowners and researchers in tropical and subtropical regions. This shift of interest may be due to benefits from the use of mixed plantation; better site use, improved tree nutrition, less insect pest damage, and accumulation of aboveground biomass and carbon sequestration at rates better than monocultures. However, Forrester et al. (2005) indicates that due to a limitation in the number of studies on mixtures, it is difficult to accurately predict success of mixed-species combinations for all site types, especially with regards to growth dynamics. In order to ensure sustainable production of the mahoganies (Khaya spp.,) into the future, a research program is being carried out by the Forestry Research Institute of Ghana in collaboration with timber industries in Ghana investing in plantations with the aim of improving the successful establishment of mahogany in plantations either in pure or mixed plantings.

In plantations, K. grandifoliola may suffer seriously from H. robusta shoot borers that kill the main stem of young trees, causing excessive branching and contributing to mortality (Opuni-Frimpong 2008). While monocultures are perceived to be very prone to pest attack, mixed plantings have been suggested as a silvicultural technique that can reduce damage by shoot borers (Floyd and Hauxwell 2001;Speight and Cory 2001;Griffiths et al. 2005). Like other studies (Menalled et al. 1998;Jactel et al. 2006;Sobek et al. 2009) that reported lower damage by pests in mixed stands, this study revealed that K. grandifoliola seems more tolerant to Hypsipyla in mixed stands than in pure stands. Perhaps the principal reason for K. grandifoliola being tolerant of Hypsipyla in the mixed stands is the provision of shade by the companion trees. Swietenia macrophylla seedlings in a high light environment were found to be more susceptible to oviposition by Hypsipyla, and therefore to attack (Mahroof et al. 2002). Opuni-Frimpong et al. ( 2008) also found that overhead canopy shade reduced the attack levels in K. ivorensis and K. anthotheca. In addition, the better tolerance to Hypsipyla by K. grandifoliola in mixed stands may be attributed to insect repellant characteristics of C. odorata, a companion tree highly susceptible to Hysipyla grandella in Central America (Floyd and Hauxwell 2001) but completely free from Hypsipyla robusta attacks in Africa (Bosu and Nkrumah).",

The land-use-land-cover change sector is the second most important source of CO 2 emissions (IPCC, 2001) as forest areas are rapidly changing into agriculture, livestock, and other man-made vegetation and degraded areas (Lambin, 1994). Additionally, studies at the regional level are needed to improve national greenhouse gas inventories, and could be developed as a basis for regional baselines of carbon sequestration projects in the forestry sector (Brown et al., 2007). Deriving more accurate estimates of emissions from LU/LC change processes is particularly important for Mexico as this sector constitutes the second largest source of CO 2 emissions after fossil fuel emissions (Ordo \u00b4n \u02dcez and Masera, 2001). Emissions from the land-use, land-cover and forestry sector (LULUCF), estimated at 43 GgC/yr (Masera et al., 2000), come mostly from deforestation and forest degradation. Annual deforestation rates in Mexico are among the highest in the world, and were estimated at more than 500,000 ha per year in the 1990s (Vela \u00b4zquez et al., 2002).

Moreover, those that have compared aboveground carbon offset potential of naturally regenerating secondary forests and plantation forests have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of the latter to attain carbon offset additionality, thus limiting broad adoption of carbon-driven forest restoration interventions. We assessed woody species diversity, stem density, stem diameter and wood specific gravity of secondary and plantation forests in Kakamega Forest in western Kenya to identify determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality in plantation forests. Secondary forests comprised old-growth, middle-aged and young vegetation stands. Plantation forests consisted of mixed indigenous, Maesopsis eminii indigenous monoculture and Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus patula and Bischofia javanica exotic monoculture stands. Assessment was carried in 135 sample plots in three forest blocks using stratified systematic sampling in nested plots. Analysis of variance indicated that there was no significant difference in woody species diversity between secondary and plantation forests due to natural forest succession in both forest types. Mixed indigenous plantation had more aboveground carbon stock than secondary forest stands of comparable stand age due to its greater proportion of tree species with high wood specific gravity and large tree diameter. Old-growth secondary forest had more aboveground carbon stock than monoculture forest plantations due to its relatively higher wood specific gravity. Middle-aged secondary forest had relatively lower aboveground carbon stock than plantation forests of comparable stand age because of its smaller tree diameter. The results suggest that stem diameter and wood specific gravity are the most important determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality. Thus, forest managers and investors in carbon offset projects can achieve aboveground carbon offset additionality in forest restoration interventions by planting tree species with relatively higher wood specific gravity and manipulating them to attain large stem diameter through silvicultural management.",

They account for only 37% of the estimated 1150 Gt of carbon that resides in forest ecosystems, but have the greatest impact on the terrestrial carbon balance (Malhi et al., 1999;Lewis et al., 2004;Lewis, 2006;Chaturvedi et al., 2011;Martin et al., 2013). This is because most of the carbon in tropical forests is stored in standing vegetation unlike the case of boreal and temperate forests where a greater proportion of the carbon is stored in the soil and in peat bogs (Malhi et al., 2002). Global wood utilization trends also indicate that wood supply in developing countries, most of which occupy the tropical zone, is driven primarily by the demand for fuel wood (Siry et al., 2005). Thus, most of the 5.6-8.6 billion tons of carbon, which is emitted annually into the atmosphere through deforestation and forest degradation (approximately 18% of present greenhouse gas emissions), originates from tropical forests (Glenday, 2006;Brickell, 2009;Keenan, 2009;Verburg et al., 2009;van der Werf et al., 2009;Orihuela-Belmonte et al., 2013). Despite such a huge contribution of deforestation and forest degradation to global greenhouse gas emissions, forest restoration efforts hold a great potential to significantly offset atmospheric carbon emissions (Brown et al., 2000;Laurance, 2007). However, large scale adoption of carbon-driven forest restoration strategies has been hampered by poor understanding of the aboveground carbon offset potential of passive and active forest restoration interventions (Lewis, 2006;Gibbs et al., 2007;Holl and Zahawi, 2014;Kinyanjui et al., 2014).",

A number of studies have indicated that natural forest regeneration accumulates significantly more aboveground carbon stock than restoration planting (Glenday, 2006;Ch'ng et al., 2011), while other studies have reported that the latter sequesters significantly more aboveground carbon stock (Zheng et al., 2008;Baishya et al., 2009;Chaturvedi et al., 2011). Other studies have indicated that plantation forests are only marginally superior to secondary forests in aboveground carbon accumulation (Omeja et al., 2012;Bonner et al., 2013). However, ITTO and FAO (2009) and Kanowski and Catterall (2010) state that plantation forests also differ in aboveground carbon accumulation potential due to variation in tree species mix and stand structural attributes and are therefore not expected to give the same results. Since the findings of each of these studies are considered accurate, it is likely that there exist specific variables that determine the aboveground carbon accumulation potential in both naturally regenerating secondary forests and planted forests. For instance, Baishya et al. (2009) attributed superior aboveground carbon accumulation potential in plantation forests over secondary forests to good silvicultural management. It was unclear, however, whether the aboveground carbon accumulation potential of naturally regenerating secondary forest stands would also increase if they were subjected to similar silvicultural treatment.",

The situation is attributed to the fact that many actors in carbon offset schemes are apprehensive of engaging in restoration efforts whose aboveground carbon sequestration potential is inferior to natural forest regeneration. It is prudent, therefore, to provide a clear picture on the determinants of aboveground carbon offset additionality in order to inform forest managers and investors in carbon offset schemes of the best forest restoration approaches to employ. In this paper, we assess the aboveground carbon offset potential of different secondary and plantation forest types using a chronosequence study in Kakamega Forest in western Kenya. The forest is an eastern relic of the African equatorial rainforest and one of the forest ecosystems that have been subjected to a great deal of degradation for close to a century (Lung and Schaab, 2006;Schaab et al., 2010). It has lost about 75% of its primary forest cover as a result of a series of disturbance events that occurred between 1930s and 1990s (Wass, 1995). Whereas most of the degraded forest sites regenerated naturally and ended up as secondary forests, some of the sites were placed under plantation forests of both indigenous and exotic tree species (Glenday, 2006;Otuoma et al., 2014). Other sites were subjected to repeat incidences of disturbance and degenerated into open fields that are presently used for grazing. The study analysed possible variation in woody species diversity, stand structural attributes and wood specific gravity in relation to aboveground carbon stock in order to identify variables that determine superiority in carbon offset potential between secondary and plantation forests in moist tropical forests. Secondary forest types comprised old-growth, middle-aged and young vegetation stands, while plantation forests consisted of mixed and monoculture indigenous and exotic stands.",

A critical concern generating debate is how well communities of trees recover into a more species rich ecosystem after restoration planting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pattern of recovery of communities of tree, assess the influence of Acanthus pubescens, Lantana camara and Pennisetum purpureum, on the recovery as well as how restoration planting facilitates recruitment of other native tree seedlings along a gradient of forest restoration in Kibale National Park, Uganda after evictions of illegal settlers. We studied six restoration forests ranging in age from 3 to 16 years, naturally regenerating and three primary forests. Our results showed that recovery with natural regeneration was more effective than restoration planting although the latter enhanced recruitment of other native tree seedling. Tree recovery was generally correlated with age so that species density and diversity increased although at different rates. A reverse pattern was found for dominance but no clear pattern was found for tree density (individual/ha). Communities of tree showed directional patterns of change however community composition were still distinct among the different forests. A. pubescens, L. camara and P. purpureum negatively correlated with species density, tree density and diversity but a positive correlation was found for dominance. Restoration planting can reestablish forests with high species density, tree density and diversity, but this is dependent on age and the extent of the herbs, grasses and shrubs cover in tropical forests.",

These estimates might be higher because illegal activities often go unnoticed. As such, forest restoration through planting or deliberate seeding is an important management tool for rehabilitating and hastily restoring forest ecosystems which have lost vegetation cover (Ormerod, 2003;Abebe et al., 2006). But whether restoration planting enhances recruitment of other native trees more than natural regeneration alone remains less well understood. Nonetheless, despite restoration approaches being operational (Kuper, 1996;Parrotta et al., 1997), the lack of adequate information on how to evaluate restoration success remains a challenge (Dunn, 2004;Bowen et al., 2007). Yet it is vital to determine the most efficient methods of enhancing natural colonization of tree species into regenerating forests in heavily degraded areas. Instead, there is debate about the prediction that future tropical deforestation rates will decrease (Wright and Muller-Landau, 2006), thus increasing the area of regenerating forests. The current level of knowledge does not support this approach (Bowen et al., 2007). Moreover, survival of many forest species depends on the capacity of disturbed areas to replenish and support their populations (Putz et al., 2000). In this study, the success of restoration efforts in recovery of tree communities was studied. After evictions of illegal settlers, tree planting was necessary because woody herbs, shrubs and grasses such as Acanthus pubescens (Acanthaceae), Aframomum spp. (Zingiberaceae), Lantana camara (Verbenaceae), Mimulopsis spp. (Acanthaceae) and Pennisetum purpureum (Poaceae) colonized forests, precluding tree regeneration (Struhsaker, 2003).

In addition understanding the influence of understorey vegetation on restoration can provide management with necessary information for monitoring forest restoration. Long term tree community dynamics and responses to thick understorey vegetation; the major cause of \"arrested succession\" are poorly understood. Invasion by e.g., A. pubescens, P. purpureum and L. camara, some of which are exotic, constitutes the second largest threat to biodiversity; leading to declines, extinction of native trees and alteration of species richness (Sharma and Raghubanshi, 2011). We predicted that A. pubescens, P. purpureum and L. camara negatively affects species density, tree density, diversity and dominance (Chapman and Chapman, 2004). We evaluated the pattern of recovery of communities of trees and the role of restoration planting in facilitating natural recruitment of other native tree species in the differently aged restoration areas. Our objectives were to; 1-Compare changes of species density, tree density, diversity and dominance, in the differently aged restoration, naturally regenerating and primary forests. 2-Compare the recruitment of nonplanted tree seedlings in the differently aged restoration, and naturally regenerating forests. 3-Assess the influence of A. pubescens, P. purpureum and L. camara on the recovery of trees.",

According to the patterns observed, tree community recovery generally correlated with \"age\" along the restoration gradient. Species density gradually increased, while dominance declined. However, no clear pattern was found for tree density (individuals/ha) and diversity. The increase in tree density and the corresponding decrease in diversity with the same approximate age (AC 8) can be linked to the fruiting cycles of planted trees, marked by high establishment of seedlings beneath canopies of the bearing trees. The results show that floristic re-assembly of tree species composition involves the process of replacement of species and not just the mere addition of new ones. This pattern is similar to (Kritzinger and van Aarde, 1998;Davis et al., 2003) where the increase in species richness and diversity over a period of time were accompanied by a clear turnover of species. Tree community composition had not converged to the composition typical of primary forests. However they approached, providing an optimistic assessment that tree community recovery in the restoration forests were at an early phase of recovery. Increase in average Bray-curtis similarity index along the restoration gradient is evidence for possible convergence within a reasonable period; a shift in composition of trees towards the primary forest (Wassenaar et al., 2005). Restoration planting facilitated the recruitment of other native tree seedlings in the forest. Seedling recruitment was supported by gradual increases in species density, tree density (individuals/ha), diversity, and a decrease in dominance of other native tree seedlings.

At the optimal harvest age for maximum biomass production (4 years), total aboveground biomass ranged from 63 Mg ha \u00c01 in the Eucalyptus monoculture to 124 Mg ha \u00c01 in the Casuarina/Leucaena mixture, and was generally greater in the mixed-species than in single-species treatments due to increased productivity of the N-\u00aexing species in the mixed stands. Total litterfall varied from 5.3 to 10.0 Mg ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 among treatments, or between 5.9% and 13.2% of net primary production. Litterfall production and rates of nutrient return for N, P, K, Ca and Mg were generally highest for Leucaena, intermediate for Casuarina and lowest for Eucalyptus.

Such plantations provide fuel, smalldimension timber, and non-wood forest products for local communities, and are being used increasingly for rehabilitating deforested watersheds and other degraded landscapes, particularly in densely populated tropical regions (Evans, 1992;Brown and Lugo, 1994;Brown et al., 1997). According to United Nations estimates, tree planting for non-industrial uses (i.e. woodlots for fuel and locally used timber, agroforestry plantings, and plantations established primarily for rehabilitation of deforested watersheds) increased dramatically between 1981 and 1990. During this period, %12 million ha, or 64% of all new plantations in tropical countries, were established for these purposes. In 1990, the total non-industrial plantation area in the tropics was estimated at 28.2 million ha, of which 82% is found in the Asia and Paci\u00aec region, 12% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 6% in Africa (FAO, 1993). The promotion of short-rotation plantations, as a solution to the chronic wood shortages faced by hundreds of millions of people in tropical regions (FAO, 1981), has raised concerns about their sustainability. Of particular concern is the risk that frequent harvest-related nutrient losses could result in soil fertility and biomass productivity declines over successive rotations, particularly on inherently infertile or otherwise degraded soils where such plantations are often established (Jorgensen et al., 1975;Kimmins, 1977;Wise and Pitman, 1981;Jorgensen and Wells, 1986;Gonc ,alves et al., 1997).

While these system nutrient exports can be reduced by harvesting and removing only stemwood and large-diameter branchwood, rather than total aboveground biomass (Kimmins, 1977;Johnson, 1983;Parrotta, 1989;Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994;Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997), this may not be a practical option in many, perhaps most, rural tropical areas where people use twigs, foliage and even leaf litter for fuel, livestock fodder, and mulch. Nitrogen-\u00aexing trees, mainly leguminous species, have been widely extolled for their soil-improving characteristics related to their production of nitrogenrich, often rapidly decomposed, leaf litter (National Academy of Sciences, 1979;Werner and Muller, 1990;MacDicken, 1994). These species are commonly used in agroforestry systems worldwide to great bene\u00aet, and have been recommended for mixed-species plantings with other, perhaps more highly valued tree species to help offset potential soil nitrogen de\u00aeciencies and increase overall biomass productivity. Although there have been some documented cases of increased productivity in mixed-species plantations in both, temperate and tropical regions, the collective results of such studies have been inconclusive and show that accurate species/site matching and choice of complementary species strongly in\u00afuence mixed-species plantation productivity (FAO, 1992).

In order for these managed forest systems to continue to provide social, economic and environmental bene\u00aets over successive harvest rotations, a better understanding of tree species' impacts on various aspects of soil fertility, including nutrient cycling processes, is therefore essential. In the case of plantations established primarily for rehabilitation of severely degraded sites, watershed stabilization, and/ or native forest restoration, additional knowledge of how planted trees can facilitate, or inhibit, natural successional processes that lead to the development of structurally diverse and functionally stable forest ecosystems is also needed.

The lack of growth response by Eucalyptus to admixture with either N 2 -\u00aexing tree species is perhaps surprising, considering the high estimated rates of nitrogen \u00aexation by Leucaena and Casuarina in the mixed-species stands with Eucalyptus (73\u00b1 74 kg N ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 ; Parrotta et al., 1996) and higher rates of nutrient cycling in these stands relative to the Eucalyptus monoculture. Nitrogen concentrations in fresh leaves or total aboveground biomass, and N retranslocation prior to leaf-fall, were not signi\u00aecantly different among treatments for Eucalyptus, which suggests that association with either N 2 -\u00aexing species is not (yet?) having any positive in\u00afuence on nutrient availability for Eucalyptus. The increased productivity of both Casuarina and Leucaena in the mixed-species stands in the present study is not easily explained and may be due to several factors. As the data presented in Table 5 show, soils beneath the mixed-species plantation treatments tended to have higher initial (0.2 year) levels of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and available magnesium, but lower levels of available phosphorus and available potassium than those in the single-species Leucaena and Casuarina treatments. It is not clear whether or not these initial differences, particularly for soil nitrogen, could account for the observed differences in their growth and yield.

Plantation effects on soils in this study were inconclusive, but suggest several general trends over the 7.5-year study period.

(1991) found signi\u00aecantly higher N concentrations in the surface (0\u00b13 cm) soils in 5.5-year-old plantations of Leucaena leucocephala than in those of Casuarina equisetifolia which, in turn, had higher soil N concentrations than those beneath Eucalyptus robusta. Similarly, DeBell et al. (1989) reported increases in soil N beneath fouryear-old stands of Albizia falcataria and mixed Albizia/Eucalyptus stands than in pure Eucalyptus stands in Hawaii. With respect to soil P and exchangeable cations, there are no consistent trends in the literature regarding the differential effects of Leucaena, Casuarina and Eucalyptus; these effects appear to be highly site-speci\u00aec and dependent on initial soil conditions. All plantation treatments included in this study provided a favorable environment for the recruitment and regeneration of a variety of native secondaryforest tree and shrub species, in contrast to the unplanted control plots in which only a single tree species was found to have regenerated naturally at very low densities. There were no signi\u00aecant differences in understory regeneration patterns between single-and mixed-species plantations. Rather, differences in the understory regeneration density and species diversity among treatments were due primarily to the presence or absence of Casuarina; in the three treatments that included Casuarina, understory regeneration was dominated by a large-seeded, batdispersed species (Calophylum brasiliense) with a fewer number of other tree species than treatments whose overstories were comprised of only Leucaena or Eucalyptus. Earlier analyses of understory development in these plantations at 4.5 year showed similar species-richness trends, but greater regeneration density beneath Leucaena than either Eucalyptus or Casuarina (Parrotta, 1995).",

These results show that all three species, whether native (Leucaena), naturalized exotic (Casuarina) or exotic (Eucalyptus), are capable of catalyzing native forest succession on this deforested, degraded site where natural regeneration processes in the absence of planted tree cover are seriously impeded by the absence of a viable soil seed bank, limitations on seed inputs by wildlife, grass competition, and unfavorable microenvironmental conditions (Parrotta, 1992b(Parrotta, , 1995;;Lugo, 1997;Parrotta et al., 1997). Thus, for the purposes of forest rehabilitation and restoration on degraded tropical lands, such plantations under appropriate management can serve a dual role by accelerating natural recovery of species-rich forest ecosystems while providing needed wood products to populations faced with shortages of fuelwood, timber and other forest products (Parrotta and Turnbull, 1997).",

These techniques included reliance on natural forest regeneration, mixed commercial species plantings of mostly exotic timber trees, direct seeding with mostly native early successional tree species, and mixed native species plantings of more than 70 tree species (the current operational restoration treatment at this site). Replicated fixed-radius plots in each treatment and in undisturbed primary forest were used to quantify the canopy and understory structure and the abundance and diversity of all vascular plant species. Treatment comparisons considered regeneration density, species richness and diversity for all floristic categories, and, for trees and shrubs, the relative contribution of initial planting and subsequent regeneration from soil seed banks and seed inputs from nearby primary forests. With the possible exception of the stands of mixed commercial species, which were superior to all others in terms of tree basal-area development but relatively poor in species richness, all treatments were structurally and floristically diverse, with a high probability of longterm restoration success. Of these, the mixed native species plantings appeared to be at least risk of arrested succession due to the dominance of a broader range of tree species of different successional stages or expected life spans. In all treatments, several lo-cally important families of primary forest trees (Annonaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae) were markedly underrepresented due to a combination of poor survival of initial plantings and limitations on seed dispersal from the surrounding primary forest.",

While these mining activities directly affect relatively small forest areas compared to forest clearance for agriculture and unsustainable logging, their off-site environmental impacts can be extensive due to erosion and runoff resulting in siltation and deterioration of water quality in nearby rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. To mitigate these adverse environmental impacts, effective forest restoration techniques are required. Their successful implementation requires careful planning and the integration of mining and rehabilitation operations based on sound silvicultural and ecological knowledge and principles (Bradshaw 1987). Proper site preparation, including minesite landscaping, topsoil handling and application, and deep-ripping of compacted subsoil, has been shown to be an essential prerequisite for good growth of planted tree species and vigorous natural regeneration of species from viable seeds contained in forest topsoil (Tacey 1979;Tacey & Glossop 1980;Fox 1984;Ferraz 1993;Grant et al. 1996;Parrotta et al. 1997). In addition, silvicultural knowledge is required to select species and establishment techniques appropriate to local site conditions and long-range restoration objectives. In many tropical regions, including the Amazon basin, restorationists lack basic, essential information on seed availability, propagation techniques, growth rates, and site adaptability for the hundreds of candidate tree species present in the natural forests (Knowles & Parrotta 1995). Forest restoration programs operated by mining companies in Brazil (Majer 1992(Majer , 1996;;Gaunt & Bliss 1993;Knowles & Parrotta 1995), Australia (Tacey 1979), and other tropical countries have therefore usually relied on the artificial regeneration of either native or exotic forest species to rapidly establish tree cover on reclaimed minesites and thereby facilitate natural forest succession.",

The mixed native species reforestation approach, involving careful site preparation (including topsoil replacement) and planting mixed stands of 80-100 species of native forest species at a total cost of approximately $2500/ha, has been the standard reforestation technique used at the Trombetas mine since the mid-1980s. This more sophisticated reforestation approach has become the industry norm in response to Brazilian environmental legislation that now requires companies to restore, to the greatest extent feasible, the original vegetation destroyed during mining. Given adequate site preparation, it would be tempting to both simplify planning and operations and minimize restoration program costs by relying solely on natural forest-successional processes. The extent to which one can rely on seed-bank germination (from applied topsoil) to establish species-rich forest cover is largely unknown, although studies of forest succession following natural disturbances and agricultural abandonment can provide some guidance and generally suggest that early successional tree species, such as Bellucia, Byrsonima, Cecropia, Croton , and Vismia in the central Amazon region of Brazil, need not be planted due to their abundance in the soil seed bank and adaptability to degraded site conditions (Uhl 1987;Uhl et al. 1988). On reclaimed minesites in this region, however, there is no certainty that succession will proceed towards mature secondary forest stands as it would following less intense forest disturbances, such as natural gap formation or timber harvesting.",

Under these conditions, hardy early successional tree species may become established, but their expected senescence and mortality within 10-20 years could result in either arrested succession or canopy opening that would facilitate invasion by persistent, fire-prone grasses that are known to preclude or severely slow subsequent forest regeneration (Uhl & Jordan 1984;Uhl et al. 1988;Nepstad et al. 1991;Parrotta 1993;Aide et al. 1995;Parrotta et al. 1997). The same risk applies to artificially regenerated forests established with the typically short-lived, often exotic, species generally used in mineland rehabilitation programs. This process has been observed elsewhere at the Trombetas minesite in both single-species stands of Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia mangium and on natural regen-eration sites from 10 to 15 years of age (J.A.P. & O.H.K., personal observation). At the Trombetas minesite, a number of reforestation methods, in addition to the standard mixed native species planting technique, were tested on a smaller scale during the 1980s. These included establishment of mixed species plantations by direct seeding with mainly shortlived, native early successional trees; mixed plantings of mostly exotic species ( Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mangium , and Sclerolobium paniculatum ); and reliance on natural regeneration following standard site preparation and topsoil application.",

The most productive treatment in terms of basal area development and height growth was the mixed commercial species treatment, followed by the natural regeneration, direct seeding, and mixed native species treatments. Tree basal areas in the restoration treatments ranged from 18% (in the mixed native species plots) to 33% (in the mixed commercial species plots) of that in the primary forest plots. An inverse relationship was observed between litter accumulation and humus depth among treatments. Litter depths were greatest in the natural regeneration treatment, followed by the mixed commercial species, direct seeding, and mixed native species treatments, and lowest in the primary forest. Humus depths, in contrast, were greatest in the primary forest, followed by the mixed native species, direct seeding, natural regeneration, and mixed commercial species treatments. Field observations indicate that the higher litter accumulation and slower humus-layer formation in the natural regeneration and mixed native species plots are due to the relatively slow decomposition of the dominant species in these stands (compared to other treatments): Cecropia spp., in the natural regeneration treatment and Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia mangium in the mixed commercial species treatment. These trends may reflect treatment differences in the development and activity of litter invertebrate communities and other litter decomposers, a topic meriting further research. Apart from the mixed commercial species treatment, overall trends in species richness indicate that the floristic composition of these treatments is generally developing, at different rates, towards that of the primary forest on the Sarac\u00e1 plateau prior to mining. But analyses of basal-area dominance among restoration treatments clearly show that it will take at least several decades before the species that presently dominate the primary forest, though often present in the understory of the restoration stands, will assume a significant structural role. The range of values recorded in this study for stand basal area, canopy height, tree density, and tree species richness are very similar to those reported for similaraged secondary forests on former slash-and-burn sites in this region.",
        "c98a6d15-91e7-457f-b705-213edc571112": "For example, in 8-year-old secondary forests near Paragominas in eastern Par\u00e1 arising after forest clearance, burning, (unsuccessful) seeding with pasture grasses, and subsequent abandonment, Uhl et al. (1988) reported that stand basal area ranged from 15.9 to 21.4 m 2 /ha and canopy height from 11 to 14 m. In their study, the overall density of trees and tree seedlings was 1.71-2.53 individuals/m 2 , or 1.00-2.05 individuals/m 2 for seedlings and saplings under 2 m tall and 0.48-0.71 individuals/m 2 for trees at or above 2 m tall. These values generally lie within the range of those recorded in our study in the natural regeneration, direct seeding, and mixed native species treatments in somewhat older stands (9-13 years old). With regard to tree species richness, which ranged 17.5 to 35.4 species per plot (78.5 m 2 ) among treatments in the present study, Uhl et al. (1988) reported a somewhat lower range of 21.0 to 24.8 tree species per 100 m 2 in the 8-year-old secondary forest stands near Paragominas. Given the more severe vegetation and soil disturbances associated with the mining process at Trombetas, it is encouraging to note the structural similarities between the various reforestation treatments at 9-13 years old and 8-year-old secondary forest stands on abandoned slash-and-burn sites subjected to minimal use or management. The results of this study reveal a number of differences among treatments that affect their long-term value for forest restoration at this site. The mixed commercial species treatment, dominated by Eucalyptus spp., Sclerolobium paniculatum, and Acacia mangium, stands out clearly at the most productive as indicated by data on basal area and tree height growth.",

The relatively low regeneration density in this treatment is most likely due in part to the rapid growth rates of the planted trees, to relatively high understory light levels, and to increased grass and herb densities, all of which result in increased root competition among germinating woody species. The significantly lower understory species richness in these stands relative to that of the other restoration treatments also suggests possible limitations on seedbank germination and/or seed inputs by birds, bats, and other mammals that are the main agents of seed dispersal from the primary forest. As a result, the floristic composition of the woody flora in this treatment was the least similar of the four treatments studied to that of the primary forest on the Sarac\u00e1 plateau. The over-whelming dominance of short-lived species (\u03fd20 and 20-40 years) in this treatment, based on percentages of species and total basal area, places these stands at greatest potential risk of early canopy senescence. Without a tall, dense, species-rich woody understory, these stands could, in the event of overstory mortality, become dominated by grasses and very short-lived pioneer trees and shrubs, as has been observed elsewhere at the minesite in 10 to 15-year-old Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia mangium plantations (J.A.P. & O.H.K., personal observation). Among the other treatments we studied, differences affecting their biodiversity restoration value are less marked. The direct seeding treatment, with its overstory dominated by Sclerolobium paniculatum, ranked very high in stand basal area and in abundance and species richness for planted trees and understory regeneration in both the smaller (\u03fd2 m) and larger (\u04432 m) height classes. Despite these highly favorable characteristics, the direct seeding treatment has two notable disadvantages.",
        "ec01ab0e-775c-40c9-933c-bc7fa3ca2585": "Despite these highly favorable characteristics, the direct seeding treatment has two notable disadvantages. The principal structural weakness of these stands is the dominance of their basal area by very short-lived (\u03fd20 years) species, particularly Sclerolobium paniculatum, which comprises more than 50% of the total stand basal area. A second, apparently related, factor is the density of grasses, which were, as in the mixed commercial species treatment, two to three times more abundant than in the mixed native species and natural regeneration treatments. High understory grass density in this treatment appears inconsistent with high seedling density and may be a recent development, as the canopy of these stands is beginning to open, allowing more light to penetrate to the forest floor and thus facilitating the establishment of grasses. If in fact the Sclerolobium-dominated canopy is senescing and favoring understory grasses, it remains to be seen if the longer-lived species now established in the understory, mostly in the smaller size classes (\u03fd2 m tall), will successfully compete and ultimately suppress these grasses or if the grasses will become more abundant and slow forest succession. Considering the remaining treatments, both the natural regeneration and mixed native species stands are developing towards late secondary native forest, although this process appears more advanced in the latter treatment. While crown cover and tree basal area are significantly greater in the natural regeneration treatment, woody species abundance (both size classes) and species richness are significantly greater in the mixed native species treatment. Further, the natural regeneration treatment overstory is dominated by short-lived, pioneer tree species (such as Cecropia, Vismia, Byrsonima spp.) to a far greater extent than in the mixed native species treatment, as was the case in the mixed commercial species and direct seeding treatments. Although the low grass density in the natural regeneration stands does not indicate over-story gap formation, the low density of woody seedlings and larger stems in this treatment raises some doubt as to whether there would be sufficient woody species cover to suppress grasses when the dominant Cecropia and other pioneer species senesce in the near future.",

These results indicate that the current reforestation approach of the Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Rio do Norte S.A.-mixed native species planting-is yielding favorable results in that the restoration process appears to be self-sustaining. These findings run contrary to the assumptions of some restorationists that high-diversity forest systems cannot be successfully established through high-diversity planting schemes (Dobson et al. 1997). But several of the most important families, in terms of dominance and ecological function, in the primary forest are presently either rare or absent from all restoration treatments (i.e., Annonaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae). Tree species from these families generally performed poorly when planted under open conditions in the mixed native species areas and generally produced larger than average seeds requiring more specialized seed dispersers for their transport from the primary forest (Parrotta et al. 1997). Assuming that the restoration treatment stands continue to develop both structurally and floristically, which appears more likely in the case of the extensive mixed native species areas than in the other (smaller-scale) treatments, species from these presently underrepresented families may eventually become established as conditions become more favorable for a greater diversity of seed-dispersing birds and mammals, and for seed germination and seedling growth. Nonetheless, restoration managers at this site should carry out understory enrichment plantings of these generally shade-demanding species when the planted trees are sufficiently tall to permit easy access, usually about 5 years after planting.",

Because these plantings consist of several species, estimation of their biomass through allometric relationships is a challenging task. We explored methods to accurately estimate biomass through harvesting 3139 trees and shrubs from 22 plantings, and collating similar datasets from earlier studies, in non-arid (>300 mm rainfall year \u00c01 ) regions of southern and eastern Australia. Site-and-species specific allometric equations were developed, as were three types of generalised, multi-site, allometric equations based on categories of species and growth-habits: (i) speciesspecific, (ii) genus and growth-habit, and (iii) universal growth-habit irrespective of genus. Biomass was measured at plot level at eight contrasting sites to test the accuracy of prediction of tonnes dry matter of above-ground biomass per hectare using different classes of allometric equations. A finer-scale analysis tested performance of these at an individual-tree level across a wider range of sites. Although the percentage error in prediction could be high at a given site (up to 45%), it was relatively low (<11%) when generalised allometry-predictions of biomass was used to make regional-or estate-level estimates across a range of sites. Precision, and thus accuracy, increased slightly with the level of specificity of allometry. Inclusion of site-specific factors in generic equations increased efficiency of prediction of above-ground biomass by as much as 8%. Site-and-species-specific equations are the most accurate for site-based predictions. Generic allometric equations developed here, particularly the generic species-specific equations, can be confidently applied to provide regional-or estate-level estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon.",

We need to understand rates of carbon sequestration by different types of planted forests (single-or mixed-species, native or exotic species). While there is information on single-species plantations, less is known about the potential for native mixed-species plantings, which can provide additional environmental benefits such as enhancing biodiversity (e.g. Bennett and Ford, 1997;Felton et al., 2010) and reclamation from dry-land salinity (e.g. Stirzaker et al., 2002). Accurate and efficient estimation of biomass in such plantings is central to understand and monitor their net contribution for sequestering atmospheric carbon. In Australia, environmental plantings accounted for up to 20% of the 1.14 Mha of afforestation which has occurred between 1990 and 2012 (DCCEE, 2012). Recent Government policy incentives (e.g. DSEWPaC, 2012) encourage land owners to establish plantings for both natural resource management and sequestration of carbon outcomes (e.g. Harper et al., 2007;Mitchell et al., 2012). Accordingly, an increased rate of establishment of environmental plantings is expected. In order to assess the likely returns for carbon and environmental benefits, and thereby facilitate investment, reliable and accurate estimates of biomass production are required. However, because these plantings are largely established on marginal land, costs associated with current measurement of biomass carbon could be a significant proportion of the carbon credits likely to be obtained (Polglase et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013a). It is therefore essential that biomass estimates are obtained as efficiently as possible to reduce costs while maintaining accuracy. One way is to develop and apply improved allometric equations (e.g. relationships between stem diameter and live biomass) to convert field inventory data to stand-based estimates of biomass.",

Efficiency may be improved through the use of generalized equations which are applicable to measurements across sites and species. These should be tested given they may result in some loss of precision (e.g. Williams et al., 2005). Several studies have developed generic equations for mixedspecies plantings in southern Australia (Forrester et al., 2005;Hamilton et al., 2005;England et al., 2006;Barton and Parekh, 2006;Paul et al., 2008Paul et al., , 2010;;Hawkins et al., 2010;Hobbs et al., 2010;Jonson and Freudenberger, 2011). These studies have shown that the precision of the generic equations is appropriate for the species and locations in which they were developed, but there reliability for a wider set of species, or locations, remain unknown. There is a need to determine whether generalised equations are applicable broadly, and whether they are best applied constrained within species, genus and growth-habit (i.e. tree or shrub form), or even wider groupings of trees or shrubs. The objective of this study was to determine the loss in accuracy with increased generality of allometric equations for mixedspecies plantings by testing predictions of above-ground biomass against that directly measured by whole-plot harvesting. The impact of including categories of site (namely climate) and species factors on the efficiency of these equations was also assessed.",

However it remains poorly known what factors influence their biomass at finer scales. Here, we investigated biomass variability after five years across a 250 ha environmental planting on a former agricultural property in southwestern Australia. We aimed to understand which factors may influence observed biomass variability. The dominant canopy tree, Eucalyptus occidentalis, was planted as seedlings, and other woody species were direct sown in vegetation associations, according to soil type and landscape position, to reflect historic native assemblages. Results from 42 survey plots stratified across these associations showed variable seedling establishment from the seed mix, and that the amount of above-and belowground biomass varied widely (Coefficient of variation = 60 %). A site mean and standard error were inadequate to capture biomass distribution. Instead, two modes were evident within the distribution at approximately 5 Mg ha -1 and 15 Mg ha -1 with variation primarily associated with differential seedling establishment and growth across the vegetation associations. Additionally, multiple regression analysis showed that stem density explained a significant amount of biomass variation whilst greater species richness was associated with increased biomass once stem density had been accounted for -models combining soil-vegetation association, number of individuals, and species richness explained between 60 and 80 % of biomass variation depending on the response variable (total or live biomass) and choice of allometric equations to predict biomass. There was some evidence for a role of nitrogen-fixing species in determining biomass variation.

We asked whether the incorporation of these additional factors significantly and parsimoniously improved the explanatory power of statistical models predicting biomass sequestration. We then discuss how this knowledge can inform the stratification of a restored woodland assemblage for the purpose of obtaining the greatest efficiency of measurement-based biomass carbon estimates across a property as a whole. We hypothesized that there are multiple, hierarchical controls on growth of woody species in environmental plantings as intimated previously (Diaz et al., 2007) and that these controls will lead to standing biomass variation across a site. For instance, and regardless of species, climate and largescale soil changes will broadly influence the amount of biomass sequestered, as shown for Acacia harpophylla (brigalow) and Acacia aneura (mulga) woodland regrowth in Queensland (Dwyer et al., 2010b;Fensham et al., 2012) and pine forests in Catalonia (Vila et al., 2003). Below the level of environmental variation at this coarse-scale, small-scale differences in topography, aspect and soil type may influence establishment and subsequent growth of individuals (Tajchman et al., 1996;Paul et al., 2008;Preece et al., 2012), especially in areas where depth to water table is an important determinant (e.g. Carter et al., 2008).",

Geometry may also be important; for instance, narrow linear plantings often have greater biomass than block plantings due to higher resource availability at their edges (Paul et al., 2013a). At a given site and topographic location, the diversity of plants, typically measured as species richness, has been shown to also influence above ground biomass (Hooper et al., 2005). However, most research supporting this relationship has been conducted in grasslands and microbial microcosms with fewer investigations of woody species assemblages in field settings (Cardinale et al., 2012). A recent meta-analysis, of the few published experimental studies of woody species growth, indicated that species richness had a positive effect on aboveground biomass, but noted that the identity and functional traits of the species involved are an important component of how much carbon will likely be sequestered (Hulvey et al., 2013). Furthermore, individual studies can show conflicting results (e.g. Potvin et al., 2011) suggesting context dependency is important. In addition to plant species number and identity, the density of established individuals potentially influences the amount of carbon sequestered by an environmental planting (Dwyer et al., 2010a;Paul et al., 2013a). Surveys of recently established non-experimental environmental plantings (and old growth forest e.g. Jacob et al., 2010;Seidel et al., 2013), as compared to experimental approaches, provide an alternative avenue to investigate potential influences on biomass/productivity, especially if 1) the planting is large enough to capture spatial heterogeneity (e.g. > 100 ha); 2) there are records of establishment practices and site conditions; and, 3) records include accurate identities and measurements of established individuals. The first two allow investigations of biomass relationships among and within soil -vegetation type associations while the latter provides important information so that suitable allometric relationships can be applied to estimate biomass and carbon (e.g. Jonson and Freudenberger, 2011).",

Peniup, a large-scale environmental planting established in southwestern Australia in 2008, meets these criteria and it thus provided us the opportunity to identify potential drivers of variation in standing biomass. Although this environmental planting lacked experimental controls, the planting was large enough (250 ha) to explore possible relationships with topography, soil type, seed mix, plant density, species richness and species identity, but small enough to ignore large-scale variation in climate. We therefore asked: What site factors are associated with the variation in total (above-and belowground) biomass across a 250 ha environmental planting? We hypothesized that there would be marked spatial variation among surveyed plots which can be explained, in part, by differences in soil-landscapes that were sown with different seed mixes. Within any one of these soil-landscapeseed mix associations (hereafter \"vegetation associations\"), we hypothesized that greater numbers of established individuals, higher species richness, and the differential proportional presence of particular functional and structural groups (e.g. nitrogen-fixing woody plants) will lead to more biomass accumulation at this early stage of growth. Disentangling the influence of each of these factors separately and attributing causation, given the constraints of the survey design, is not possible; however we can make inferences using the statistical approach adopted. Finally, we also investigated whether biomass relationships with potential drivers varied among the different vegetation associations. All our hypotheses were defined a priori and informed by (limited) previous studies of these relationships in smaller-scale environmental plantings elsewhere in Australia (e.g. Erskine et al., 2006;Dwyer et al., 2010b;Kanowski and Catterall, 2010;Paul et al., 2013a) as well as our local ecological knowledge, and observations of seedling establishment at Peniup (Jonson, 2010;Hallett et al., 2014).",

To summarize, total (above-and belowground) biomass varied widely across the site, both within and between vegetation associations. Much of this variation was expected because restoration species mixes had been tailored to the landscape position and soil type. Through multiple regression analyses, we showed that vegetation association was the primary correlate, explaining between a third and half of all variation in biomass. Across associations, the number of individuals within a plot also contributed to explaining plot biomass. As we initially hypothesized, species richness added F o r r e v i e w o n l y significant explanatory power to the most parsimonious models, which ultimately explained at least two-thirds of biomass variation. There was limited evidence for interactions among these effectswe only found a different relationship between number of individuals and biomass accrual depending on vegetation association in one model. We also hypothesized that the proportional contribution (based on numbers of individuals) of certain functional and structural groups would provide explanatory power to understanding biomass accumulation. We found the contribution of nitrogen fixers was important when biomass was calculated with local allometric equations and not when generic low-rainfall allometric equations were used to calculate biomass. Contrary to our hypotheses, structural identity (e.g., proportion of shrubs, proportion of Eucalyptus occidentalis, and proportion of all eucalypts) failed to explain a significant amount of biomass variation in the most parsimonious models once numbers of individuals had been accounted for.",

Although they account for less than 1% of the total area of tropical forests worldwide, they can store up to 1083 \u00b1 378 MgC ha -1 , which is greater than other ecosystems (Murdiyarso et al., 2015;Spalding et al., 2010). Thus, earlier studies have indicated the pivotal role in carbon (C) sequestration played by mangroves in the global C budget and in mitigating climate change (Alongi, 2014;Donato et al., 2011). Mangrove forests also provide essential ecosystem functions and services, including nursery and breeding sites for coastal marine species, protecting coastal areas against natural hazards, and providing food and fuel products for coastal communities (Alongi, 2002;Duarte et al., 2013). Nevertheless, mangrove forests have degraded rapidly, with more than 35% of the world's total mangrove area lost from 1980 to 2000 due to forest land conversion for agriculture, mariculture, urbanization, and natural disturbances such as cyclones, tsunamis, and so on (Alongi, 2002;Valiela et al., 2001). The degradation of mangrove forests causes a loss of their ecosystem functions and services, biodiversity, and a decrease in their C sequestration potential (Duke et al., 2007;Mcleod et al., 2011). Notably, the loss of mangrove forests leads to the acceleration of remineralization and erosion processes of organic carbon (OC) in mangrove sediments, resulting in the emission of a significant amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere (Bouillon, 2011;Lovelock et al., 2011). In recent decades, a number of restoration programs have been initiated in various regions around the world for the replanting of mangrove forests. These programs mainly focus on silviculture, coastal stabilization, and environmental mitigation or remediation (Ellison, 2000).",

The development of forest structure, soil C stocks and burial rates in restored mangrove forests can be measured from a forest chronosequence (Lovelock et al., 2010;Lunstrum and Chen, 2014;Marchand, 2017). A careful monitoring of ecosystem C storage along a mangrove forest chronosequence, therefore, will meet the informational requirements for the temporal reporting of C emissions in REDD+ schemes (Gibbs et al., 2007;Olander et al., 2012). In coastal ecosystems, large quantities of C have been stored in the sediments (Donato et al., 2011;Fourqurean et al., 2012). Sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) reflects the processes associated with C exchange and sequestration, which originated from both autochthonous sources (mangrove leaf litter) and allochthonous sources (suspended particulate matter) (Bouillon et al., 2003). The apportioning of sources of OC in coastal sediments is necessary to improve knowledge of the origins of the C stored within REDD+ accounting (Duarte et al., 2013). The stable isotope of carbon (\u03b4 13 C) is an effective indicator and has frequently been applied for tracing sources of SOC in the mangrove ecosystems (Bouillon et al., 2003;Tue et al., 2011). The mixing of two endmembers with mangrove leaf litter (characterized by low \u03b4 13 C values) and suspended particulate matter (characterized by higher \u03b4 13 C values) will lead to the maintaining or altering of the \u03b4 13 C values of mangrove sediments (Bouillon et al., 2008). Therefore, the relative contribution of each OC source to SOC can be examined through \u03b4 13 C values of mangrove sediments and sources.",

However, the question whether restored mangrove forests enhance ecosystem C storage and sediment OC has not been addressed. In the present study, we hypothesized that restored mangrove forests would markedly enhance ecosystem C storage and sediment OC content, and mangrove-derived organic matter would be a predominant source of OC in the sediments. Thus, the first objective was to quantify ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests by measuring the above-ground biomass of trees, downed woody debris, the below-ground biomass of roots, sediment OC, and overall depth.

Most plantations in humid tropical regions are established in pure plots, including few species of high commercial value, generally exotics.

The species with the best growth were Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, and Hieronyma alchorneoides. The mixed plantations performed better than pure plantations for all growth variables considered, including height, diameter at breast height, volume, and aboveground biomass. Mixed plantations outperformed pure plantations economically, with Net Present Value (NPV) of $1,124 to $8,155/ha and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 7.7-15.6% depending on the species mixture. The most profitable pure plantations were those of Vochysia guatemalensis, with NPV and IRR of $6,035/ha and 14.3%, respectively; Hieronyma alchorneoides ($2,654 and 10.8%); and Virola koschnyi ($1,906/ha and 9.22%). These are the estimated benefits that would be accrued at harvest. These projections are realistic since the decision to harvest is generally mandated not just by profit maximization but by economic necessity, thus many small-to medium-scale farmers in Costa Rica harvest plantations prior to the completion of the rotation length. Mixed plantation may be the preferred system for reforestation with native species designed for timber production or carbon sequestration because this system is more economically viable and productive than pure plantations.",

Reforestation in the tropics has been dominated by monospecific plantations because of their apparent economic and management advantages, such as the concentration of resources dedicated to the growth of a desired species, the simplicity of seedling production and stand management, and a uniform harvest with regular rotation cycles (Evans and Turnbull 2004). Furthermore, reforestation efforts have been dominated by the establishment of exotic species plantations, such as Acacia, Eucalyptus, Pinus, and Tectona (FAO 2001). In Costa Rica, the majority of reforestation programs promoted by government incentives facilitated the inclusion of several native species (Thacher et al. 1997). Some local farmers have adopted mixed-species plantations for the greater range of products and environmental services they provide (Piotto et al. 2004). Traditionally, most reforestation programs with native tree species in Central America have been based on results from young plantations and a relatively superficial understanding of the autoecological characteristics of selected species (Wishnie et al. 2007). Until recently, the use of native tree species in Central America was promoted exclusively for rural development and domestic wood production. The use of native tree species in the region has now expanded to include other purposes such as industrial wood production and commercial-scale carbon sequestration (Lam et al. 2010). As a result, demand has increased for information about the long-term performance of native tree species, silvicultural systems for timber and biomass production, and the economic viability of reforestation in the region. Few long term studies in the region have tested whether stand composition affects the growth performance and biomass accumulation of native tree plantations (Ewel and Mazzarino 2008). In this study, results of growth and productivity of pure and mixed experimental plantations with native species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, were analyzed and compared to growth predictions for native species in the region.",

Vochysia guatemalensis had good growth in both pure and mixed plantations, but performed considerably better in mixed plots than pure plots of this study or other pure plantations established by farmers in the region (Redondo-Brenes 2007). Virola koschnyi and J. copaia also exhibited good growth in pure and mixed plots, but their wood has low density and lower value than that of other species of this research such as H. alchorneoides, C. brasiliense, and D. oleifera (Table 1).

Another species with good performance and high-value, dense wood is H. alchorneoides, which frequently has problems with bole form and bifurcation (Piotto et al. 2003) and requires intensive pruning of low branches. Both T. amazonia and H. alchorneoides showed significantly higher growth in mixed plots, indicating that mixed plantations may be the best production system for these species in the region. Calophyllum brasiliense, S. microstachyum, G. americana and P. guachapele trees suffered complete mortality in pure plantations, primarily because of pests and disease, with some survival in mixed plantations. A remarkable case was the death of C. brasiliense in pure plots between 2004 and 2006. Prior to this period, C. brasiliense had been considered among the most promising of the species studied for use in reforestation programs focused on carbon sequestration, given its relatively high-density wood and fast growth (Redondo-Brenes and Montagnini 2006). Prior to 2004, C. brasiliense had better performance in pure plots, with an expected rotation cycle of 18.5 years in pure plantations (Petit and Montagnini 2004). However, all trees in the pure plots died at 15 years of age.

Long-term productivity of pure and mixed plantation Most species responded positively with higher growth and survival to the reduced intraspecific competition present in mixed plots. In the long term, the results demonstrated that regardless of species composition, mixed plantations performed better for all variables considered. In all plantations, mixed plots produced more aboveground biomass than any species in pure plots (Tables 3 and4). Mixed plots in Plantations 1 and 2 produced over 100 tons ha -1 at 16.5 years of age, comparable to other plantations or secondary forests with the same age in the region (Brown and Lugo 1990). However, Plantation 3 produced less aboveground biomass than the other plantations, indicating that species selection is an important factor in designing more productive mixed plantations. Nonetheless, mixed plantations may be more suitable for reforestation programs designed to market carbon credits because they were more productive than pure plantations. In addition, mixed plantations have proved to be a more resilient system in the long term against pests, diseases, and climatic variations (Schroth et al. 2000;Clark et al. 2003). In pure plots, the total volume of V. guatemalensis was over 400 m 3 ha -1 , greater than the other species used in this study and comparable to the volume expected for exotic species currently planted in the region such as Gmelina arborea Roxb. and Tectona grandis (L.f.)

Studies conducted in the understories of the experimental plantations indicated an abundant and rich woody regeneration had developed under the plantation species (Cusack and Montagnini 2004;Butler et al. 2008). Planted trees may have experienced greater competition with a more vigorous understory community after management interventions ceased. This possible increase in competition might have caused the overall decrease in productivity observed recently in all plantations. Greater total plant density might have debilitated the planted native tree species, thereby increasing their susceptibility to herbivores or pathogens (Bell et al. 2006).",

Across diversity levels, the mean observed aboveground C pool was 7.9 \u00b1 2.5 Mg ha -1 in 2006 and 20.4 \u00b1 7.4 Mg ha -1 in 2009, a 158% increase.

In this context, a number of studies have recently compared the productivity of mixed-species plantations with monocultures to test whether diversity would enhance productivity and hence C storage (Caspersen and Pacala, 2001;Vila et al., 2007;Firn et al., 2007;Schlapfer and Schmid, 1999;Piotto et al., 2010;Erskine et al., 2006). Tree plantations and agroforests are widely believed to enhance the terrestrial C pool (Nair et al., 2009b) and reforestation with native species could potentially yield a range of additional benefits, including soil stabilization, reduced erosion, habitat for a variety of species including birds, seed deposition, and increased understory diversity (Wishnie et al., 2007). Nevertheless, there is a growing concern that tree plantations, whether with natives or exotics, might decrease water availability at the ecosystem level (Malmer et al., 2010). Many studies examining the effect of tree diversity on productivity or C storage used aboveground tree biomass as a surrogate for net primary productivity (NPP: the total production of plant biomass within a given time period) (Catovsky et al., 2002). NPP is a good indicator of ecosystem C storage only if large-scale disturbances during a specific period can be ruled out, because C is lost through heterotrophic respiration, fire and other disturbances such as human harvest (K\u00f6rner, 2000(K\u00f6rner, , 2003;;Schlesinger and Lichter, 2001;Schulze et al., 2000). Ecosystem C storage is tightly coupled with changes in the soil that occur in response to alterations in above-and below-ground productivity, rooting depth and root distribution, and changes in the quality and quantity of litter (Catovsky et al., 2002;Nair et al., 2009b;Valverde-Barrantes, 2007).",

The difference between GPP and R a expresses the net primary production (NPP) and is the net carbon uptake by plants that can be used for new biomass production. Measurements from a range of ecosystems have shown that total plant respiration can be as large as 50 % of GPP (e.g., Etzold et al., 2011) and together with R h comprises total ecosystem respiration (R e ; R e = R a + R h ). The partitioning of the ecosystem carbon fluxes can therefore be summarized as (1) Earlier campaign-based measurements carried out by Maseyk et al. (2008a) and Gr\u00fcnzweig et al.

Soil moisture impacts on R s have been observed in arid and Mediterranean ecosystems, where T s and SWC are negatively correlated (e.g., Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2009). CO 2 efflux generally increases with increasing soil temperatures (Frank et al., 2002), which can produce positive feedback on climate warming (Conant et al., 1998), converting the biosphere from a net carbon sink to a carbon source (IPCC, 2014). A range of empirical models have been developed to relate R s rate and temperature (Balogh et al., 2011;Lellei-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2011), and the most widely used models rely on the Q 10 approach (Bond-Lamberty and Thomson, 2010), which quantifies the sensitivity of R s to temperature and can integrate it with physical processes, such as the rate of O 2 diffusion into and CO 2 diffusion out of soils and the intrinsic temperature dependency of enzymatic processes (Davidson and Janssens, 2006).

While R s is generally constrained by low SWC during summer months, abrupt and large soil CO 2 pulses have been observed after rewetting the dry soil (Matteucci et al., 2015). The objectives were twofold: first, to obtain detail on partitioning of the carbon fluxes in a semiarid pine forest to help explain the high productivity and carbon use efficiency recently reported for this ecosystem (Qubaja et al., 2019) and provide process-based information to assess the carbon sequestration potential of such a semiarid afforestation system; and second, to combine this 2016 study with the results of a similar one at the same site in 2003(mean values for 2001-2006;Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2007Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., , 2009) ) to obtain a long-term perspective across 13 years on soil respiration and its partitioning.

Overall, the results support our research hypothesis that the observed high CUE at our site is at least partly due to the characteristics of the carbon flux partitioning that can be associated with the semiarid conditions. Compared to other sites and climates (see comparative compilation in Table S3 in the Supplement), the results reflect several key points: (1) relatively high belowground allocation; (2) low soil respiration in general and low heterotrophic respiration in particular; (3) combining the results for 2016 and those of our earlier study offered a longterm perspective across 13 years, indicating that the low R s in this ecosystem is robust and exhibits reduced sensitivity to temperature; and (4) there is a general long-term shift from autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. Comparing CO 2 fluxes in this forest with fluxes in a range of European forests showed that mean NEP in the semiarid forest (167 g C m -2 yr -1 ) is similar to the mean NEP in other European forests (150 g C m -2 yr -1 ; FLUXNET). Carbon partitioning belowground (TBCA / GPP) was relatively high (\u223c 38 %), with little change across the long-term observation period. It is, however, within the range of mean values for forests in different biomes (Litton et al., 2007). High belowground allocation helps explain the high rate of SOC (soil organic carbon) accumulation observed over the period since afforestation (Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2007;Qubaja et al., 2019).",

The results show that considering the abiotic effects on estimating soil respiration and, in turn, on estimating the carbon budget in dry calcareous soils can play an important part in estimating soil and ecosystem respiration fluxes (Angert et al., 2015;Roland et al., 2012). The soil CO 2 efflux in the semiarid forest (295 g C m -2 yr -1 ) is at the low end of R s values across the range of climatic regions, from 50 to 2750 g C m -2 yr -1 (Adachi et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2014;Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2009;Hashimoto et al., 2015).

The observed low R s values were associated with a relatively high fraction of autotrophic and a lower fraction of heterotrophic respiration. The mean annual-scale R sa /R s ratio of 0.40 was at the high end of the global range of 0.09 to 0.49 (Chen et al., 2014;Hashimoto et al., 2015). In contrast, heterotrophic respiration showed an annual-scale R h /R s ratio of 0.39 \u00b1 0.02 (Table 2 and Fig. 3), which is lower than the estimated global mean R h /R s value of 0.56 (Hashimoto et al., 2015) but within the range of Mediterranean region forest, which varies between 0.29 and 0.77 (Casals et al., 2011;Luyssaert et al., 2007;Matteucci et al., 2015;Misson et al., 2010;Rey et al., 2002;Rodeghiero and Cescatti, 2005). The relatively low annual scale of the heterotrophic respiration to R s is consistent with the dry soil over much of the year in this forest (Figs. 2 and S6) and the observed low decomposability of plant detritus and the high mean SOC accumulation rate (Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2007). The long-term perspective from the 13-year observation period indicates emerging trends that can be a basis for assessing the effects of forest age and the evident increase in LAI (Table 3) and changes in environmental conditions (gen-erally warming and drying; see, e.g., Lelieveld et al., 2012).",

This shows a shifting trend from the autotrophic components to the heterotrophic, with little change in the contribution of R s to the overall efflux. The ratios of R sa , R l , and R w to R e tended to decrease by about 13 %, while that of R h increased by about 18 %; similar trends were seen in soil respiration, with R sa /R s decreasing by -19 % and R h /R s increasing by +8 % (Table 3). The relatively low R s under conditions of high temperature in the semiarid ecosystem implies reduced sensitivity of respiration to temperature. This is partly imposed by low SWC conditions during extended parts of the year (Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2009;cf. Rey et al., 2002;Xu and Qi, 2001). Accordingly, R s showed greater sensitivity to T s in the wet period, but, during the 8-9 months of the year when SWC was below \u223c 0.2 m 3 m -3 , R s varied predominantly with water availability. The long-term perspective reported in Table 3 indicates a further decrease in temperature sensitivity, with mean Q 10 values in the dry season decreasing from 1.6 to 1.1. These estimated Q 10 values are generally consistent with published values for different ecosystems (1.4 to 2.0; Hashimoto et al., 2015;Zhou et al., 2009) and with low values under low SWC (Reichstein et al., 2003;Tang et al., 2005).",

Finally, we also note that the greater importance of moisture availability in influencing respiration is clearly apparent from the observed relationships of R s and R h to mean annual precipitation (MAP) in European evergreen needle forests (Fig. S8; see also Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2007), which are not observed with respect to mean annual temperature.",

The state of Rond\u00f4nia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the country, totaling 1,394 km 2 in 2016 (INPE, 2016), becoming a significant emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere and threatening the environmental services provided by the forest (BASTOS et al., 2015). The problem is augmented when one takes into account the low natural resilience of ecosystems, sometimes requiring human intervention to recover them. Forest restoration in the Amazon means a concrete action to recover its biodiversity and ecological functions, and to mitigate GHG emissions (SILVA et al., 2015). There are currently several programs aiming at restoring degraded areas (ANDRADE et al., 2014), but these actions can be more or less successful.

The main indicators used in monitoring programs are assessments of soil cover, biomass, stratification, carbon sequestration rate, recruitment and mortality rates, and number and proportion among native plant species (UEHARA; GANDARA, 2011). The carbon stock in a forest area undergoing recovery may be an important indicator of the degree of success in restoration. Biomass refers to the amount of plant material available in a given forest formation. Forest species have the ability to fix carbon for years or decades and store it in their structure (LITTON et al., 2007).",

However, to quantify carbon stocks in areas under restoration, it is indispensable to use methods that generate reliable estimates (ASHTON et al., 2012). It is important that indirect methods be calibrated with primary data collected from the field so that they reflect the local and regional reality of the structure of forests under restoration. Although labor-intensive, highly time-consuming, resource-demanding and environmentally sensitive, direct determinations are the basis for any modeling of biomass and carbon stocks in forests. Such determinations should be combined with forest inventory, respective laboratory analyses and modeling in order to generate reliable estimates of biomass and carbon. Some key questions emerge when quantifying biomass and carbon in young forests. Most biomass and carbon equations published in the correlative literature were fitted to primary or mature forests with a distinct floristic composition, morphometry and wood density of tree species. Another relevant point is that estimates of biomass and carbon for tropical forests were generally derived from equations outside the usual biometric range in young stands of forest restoration. The use of an allometric equation outside of data limit fitted was can result in inaccuracy (MUGASHA et al., 2016;NAM et al., 2016) and gross errors, making it unusable. There is a lack of knowledge about the biomass and carbon stocking process in forest restoration plantations, especially with consideration to their compartmentalization and modeling, thus leaving a gap in information regarding the potential of such forests as carbon sinks (MIRANDA et al., 2011). Therefore, the objective of this study is to quantify the carbon stocks in young forest restoration stands with native species in the Amazon region of Rond\u00f4nia, to model it from tree measurement variables, and to evaluate the removal of dioxide carbon emissions from the atmosphere.",

Not even the IPCC has default values for these quantities. The default R value of the IPCC for tropical forests is 0.37, with a variation of 0.20 to 0.56 depending on the ecological zone. By deducting BEF and R for forest restoration projects in Brazil from works on the Atlantic Forest (NOGUEIRA Jr et al., 2014), a much higher value is reached for both: 2.40 and 1.92 for BEF, respectively, and 0.25 and 0.41 for R, respectively. Characteristics of the site and the morphometry of the species may be reasons explaining such differences. The values found in this study for BEF and R, on the other hand, are comparable to those found in pure commercial stands of Pinus spp. (SANQUETTA et al., 2011) and Populus sp. (SCHIKOWSKI et al., 2015). The equations of biomass analyzed in this study presented a medium degree of adjustment for both the single input and the dual input models. However, the incorporation of the variable basic specific mass of wood improved greatly adjustment indicators (Table 3, Figure 1). If the average carbon estimated increase in this study was constant over time, it would take about 75 years for the C stock of the native forest to be reached. However, other authors found biomass values in the northern region of Rond\u00f4nia between 288 and 534 t.ha -1 , which would be equivalent to 130 to 240 t of carbon per hectare (KAUFFMANN et al., 2009). Therefore, the theoretical calculation of the recovery of the carbon stock by the stands of forest restoration under consideration would be between 52 and 96 years.

There is little information on the potential of forest restoration plantations to store carbon in the Amazon Rainforest. In other biomes, there are more studies (e.g., NOGUEIRA JR et al., 2014), mainly in the Atlantic Forest. Great differences in rates of biomass increase in forest restoration stands have been observed for both Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest. The literature shows carbon stock values at ages close to that of this study, ranging from 7 to 32 t.ha -1 , which means that the stands in our study are in a medium condition in terms of productivity. We can also make a parallel between the carbon stocks in the stands of this study with young forests under natural regeneration. Studies of biomass and carbon stocks in the Amazon forest found variations between 30-40 t.ha - 1 which could reach up to 50 t.ha -1 in low plateau forests, and ecological tension with approximately 14 years of regeneration and units with only 19 t.ha -1 in areas of minor secondary vegetation. Carbon stocks evaluation of forest fragments vegetation in tropical landscapes changed by anthropic activities and values range from 5.24 to 25.93 t C.ha - 1 .

Torres and Lovett (2012) considered that the use of equations at a settlement level is very promising, since the basal area, among other predictive biomass and carbon variables that can be quickly measured in the field, may facilitate their application based on data collected in conventional forest inventories. By using the equation of Figure 2, it is possible to estimate the carbon stock (and biomass) from the basal area, applying it to stands with similar characteristics. The expansion of researches like this one, on family farming properties, may guide payment for environmental services policies. These policies can generate alternative income for thousands of families in the near future, allowing the maintenance of ecosystem services and, consequently, improvements in conservation activities in Amazon Rainforest. These young restoration stands grow faster than the mature forest and then have a great capability to store carbon in their biomass. Therefore, they are important allies to the mitigation of GHG emission. Considering that a flex-fuel vehicle, which uses gasoline as the main fuel, emits 2.21 kg CO2.l -1 of petrol and 1.53 CO2.l -1 of hydrated ethanol (GHG PROTOCOL, 2018), the annual rate of fixation/sequestration per hectare of the stands would correspond to the consumption of 5,300 l of fuel.",

Here, we compare results from mature forest and nearby 15-20 year old tree plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate differences in allocation of carbon to aboveground production and root systems. We found that the tree plantations, which had fully developed, closed canopies, allocated more carbon belowground -to their root systems -than did mature forest. This increase in belowground carbon allocation correlated significantly with aboveground tree growth but not with canopy production (i.e., leaf fall or fine litter production). In contrast, there were no correlations between canopy production and either tree growth or belowground carbon allocation. Enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake, providing nutrients beyond those required for the production of short-lived tissues such as leaves and fine roots, and thus enabling biomass accumulation. Our analyses support this deduction at our site, showing that enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can be an important mechanism promoting biomass accumulation during forest growth in the moist tropics. Identifying factors that control when, where and for how long this occurs would help us to improve models of forest growth and nutrient cycling, and to ascertain the role that young forests play in mitigating increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.",

Continued loss of forest cover, and accelerating rates of loss in the tropics [3], impart importance to the understanding of processes that promote forest growth and of recovery of the benefits they provide [4]. For example, biomass accrual in secondary forests and plantations partially mitigates the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions that result from land use changes [5]. Biomass accumulation during forest stand development is one of the most paradigmatic processes in ecology [6], [7] and, on one level, is readily understood: the growth of a cohort of small trees to larger sizes through time reflects biomass accrual at the stand level. However, the processes that control the strength and duration of carbon (C) accumulation in growing forests remain poorly defined. Rates of biomass C accumulation can be particularly rapid in young tropical forests and plantations [8], [9], [10], but sustaining rapid tree growth requires substantial supplies of nutrients [11]. This implies, and we propose, that rates of aboveground biomass accumulation and belowground C allocation (BCA) in growing tropical forests are coupled, such that both processes vary together and independently of canopy production. We tested these hypotheses, and alternatives, using evidence provided by extensive measurements of key aspects of C cycling in young plantations and mature forest stands growing on the same soils in lowland Costa Rica. Forest growth depends upon the capture of aerial resources, primarily sunlight and CO 2 , by leaves, and of soil resources, primarily water and nutrients, by fine-root systems (we use this terminology to emphasize that mycorrhizas are specifically included). Increased rates of leaf production and tree growth must be balanced by increased uptake of soil resources by root systems. Plants may adjust their allocation of available resources to balance the uptake of multiple limiting resources [12], [13]. However, there is a fundamental difference between allocation of assimilated C to leaves versus to fine-root systems.",

Photosynthesis saturates at high leaf area index (LAI, the area of leaves per unit ground area), although other factors such as leaf nitrogen (N) content and display angle are also involved [15]. Maximum LAI may develop relatively quickly in growing forests but does not thereafter increase, and may decrease [16]. Does a similar limit exist belowground? It is theoretically possible. Fine roots and mycorrhizas absorb nutrients from the soil and deplete soil nutrient concentrations within the rhizosphere, with the extent of depletion diminishing with distance from an absorbing root or hyphal surface [17]. At high densities, fine-root systems could efficiently capture available soil nutrients such that growth and maintenance of more extensive root systems would have diminishing values. However, in contrast to many theoretical and empirical studies that support the existence of a maximum sustainable leaf area, there is no parallel evidence that forest soils frequently are saturated with fine-root systems. Young secondary forests and plantations in the moist tropics can grow very rapidly [9], [10]. However, tree biomass contains nutrients and biomass accumulation entails nutrient sequestration in relatively long-lived woody tissues. Rapidly growing tropical forests may therefore be particularly prone to developing nutrient limitations. Increased allocation of newly fixed C to the support, regeneration, and expansion of fine-root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake. By increasing the amount of absorbing surface area per volume of soil, more extensive fine-root systems may more effectively intercept available soil nutrients [17]; more effectively exploit nutrient-rich hot spots and transient pulses of nutrient availability [18]; and generally compete more successfully with soil microbes for nutrients. Some tree species produce root nodules that support mutualistic N-fixing bacteria [19]. Almost all trees enhance their nutrient uptake capacities by supporting mycorrhizas [20].",

Many plant roots release organic compounds into the soil that promote soil organic matter turnover and nutrient availability to plants [21], [22], [23]. Via these and other processes, greater plant allocation of available substrates to fine-root systems may improve plant nutrition and thereby enhance forest growth. Greater allocation of C belowground could be a common feature of growing forests (e.g., [24]). The word 'allocation' has been used variably within plant physiology and forest ecology literatures [25]: we herein use 'allocation' to indicate a flux of organic substrates to specific forest components, with units of mass area 21 time 21 . Aboveground, we distinguish canopy production and tree growth, with allocation to canopy production being empirically determined from measurements of fine litterfall including leaves, and aboveground tree growth being equivalent to aboveground biomass increment (ABI). We also use leaf fall, the leaf component of fine litterfall, as a proxy for leaf production. We sum canopy production and tree growth to provide a widely used [26], [27] estimate of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Belowground, we consider only total BCA, which includes both belowground NPP and respiratory CO 2 from roots and their rhizospheres. We do so because cleanly distinguishing the specific pathways of C flux belowground remains fraught with uncertainty: this does not influence the comparisons we make between specific fluxes measured across sites. We do not use ratios or proportions to express allocation without explicitly stating so, to avoid confusion with 'partitioning', which refers to the proportion of total photosynthesis (GPP) that is utilized by a particular forest component or process [25]. We recognize that canopy production implies more than light capture for photosynthesis by leaves: it includes leaves but also twigs (# 1 cm diameter), meristems, and flowers and fruits. In addition to being the site of photosynthesis, plant canopies perform nitrate and sulfate reduction, and supply nutrients to roots [28]. They also produce and sense plant growth hormones that affect C allocation to roots and shoots [29].",

Analysis of compiled data from a range of primarily mature and moist tropical forests indicated that NPP was distributed among canopy, wood, and fine root components in mean proportions of 34, 39 and 27%, respectively, and that variations from these mean proportions reflected a trade-off between fine roots and wood [27]. A similar conclusion was derived with a data-tested model of C allocation strategies of trees in old-growth forests [30]. Our proposition of a positive relationship between BCA and tree growth in young tropical forests contradicts these ideas. Nevertheless, based on the theoretical considerations described above, we suggest that growing forests may necessarily be more flexible in their allocation of production, to successfully balance nutrient uptake with aboveground growth [10], [11], [18]. We used a case-study approach to test alternative scenarios of forest C allocation (Fig. 1), which served as multiple working hypotheses sensu [31], by directly comparing data from concurrent studies of mature forest and replicated 15-20 year old plantations of native tree species located in close proximity to one another on the same highly weathered soils in lowland Costa Rica. Our primary objective was to assess whether between-site differences in tree growth rates (i.e., wood productivity) could be ascribed to (I) differences in canopy production (scenario B in Fig. 1), (II) differences in BCA (scenario C in Fig. 1), or (III) proportionally equivalent differences in both processes (scenario A in Fig. 1). As illustrated in Figure 1, allocation of substrates to canopy production (flow 1) can generate a positive feedback to NPP (flow 6). In that case (Fig. 1B) a positive correlation between tree growth and canopy production is expected (e.g., [26]). Similarly, preferential allocation of available substrates to root systems (BCA, flow 3 in Fig. 1) may stimulate soil nutrient turnover and uptake (flow 4), also producing a positive feedback to NPP (flow 5), in which case (Fig.",

If available substrates are allocated in consistent proportions to leaves, to wood, and to root systems (Fig. 1A), i.e., with 'fixed allocation coefficients' [27], [32], then canopy production, tree growth, and BCA will all correlate with one another across both growing and mature forest plots. To fulfill our objective we tested multiple hypotheses that together made it possible to distinguish among the alternative allocation scenarios depicted in Figure 1. First, to assess possible differences in canopy attributes related to productivity ('canopy processes' in Fig. 1), we hypothesized that (H1a) total leaf area, (H1b) leaf litter production (i.e., leaf fall), (H1c) N concentrations in leaf fall, and (H1d) leaf fall N fluxes were similar between the plantations and mature forest. Second, to determine if the two sites differed in aboveground productivity, we tested the hypotheses that (H2a) litterfall, (H2b) aboveground tree growth, and their sum, (H2c) ANPP, were similar. To identify belowground differences, we tested the hypothesis (H3) that BCA (flow 3 in Fig. 1) was greater in the plantations than in the mature forest. Belowground C allocation is an empirically based assay of the amount of photosynthetically produced substrate that is transported from the canopy through the phloem to root systems in forests [33]. Lastly, to determine which of the three alternative allocation scenarios (Fig. 1A,B,C) best describes observed differences among mature forest and plantation plots, we applied correlation analyses.",

However, rapid forest growth requires nutrients. A case example is provided by rapidly growing plantations of four native tree species in lowland Costa Rica. There, C sequestration rates in biomass averaged .5 Mg ha 21 year 21 over the first 16 years of tree growth and were still high, nearly 4 Mg C ha 21 year 21 , at age 16 [10]. This rapid C sequestration was accompanied by very rapid rates of N uptake by the vegetation, which averaged 350 kg N ha 21 year 21 , much of which was derived from soil N stocks [56]. It may be difficult to sustain such rapid tree growth and nutrient uptake. Nutrient limitations are widespread [57], [58] and potentially depress tree growth and stand-level biomass accumulation rates [11], [59]. We asked ''What processes promote nutrient uptake by, and alleviate nutrient limitation to, these rapidly growing tropical forest stands?'' We theorized that additional allocation of C to root systems in growing forests could promote the uptake of soil nutrients needed to support tree growth. We specifically conjectured that rates of aboveground biomass accumulation and belowground C allocation were linked, such that both processes would vary together and independently of leaf or canopy production, other factors being similar. We tested these ideas by putting forth three alternative scenarios of C allocation (Fig. 1) and testing their predictions based on combining all relevant plot-level data from both sites. In the fixedallocation scenario (Fig. 1A) BCA, tree growth and canopy production would all correlate with one another across both plantation and mature forest plots. However, neither BCA nor tree growth were significantly related to canopy production, measured as either leaf fall or total fine litter production (Fig. 4). In the canopy-feedback scenario (Fig. 1B) positive correlations between canopy production (flow 1 in Fig. 1) and tree growth (flow 2 in Fig.",

We found that leaf fall and litterfall provided virtually equivalent measures of canopy production (r = 0.88), but tree growth was not related to either variable (Fig. 4, Table S4). The belowground-feedback scenario (Fig. 1C), in contrast, predicts a positive correlation between BCA and tree growth, but no correlation between BCA and canopy production. This scenario is consistent with our findings: aboveground biomass increments (i.e., tree growth) increased with increasing BCA whereas there was no correlation between BCA and canopy production (P.0.4). Direct comparisons of measured variables within the mature forest to those of the plantations also are consistent with a belowground-feedback scenario. Although ANPP was greater in the plantations than in the mature forest, no significant differences in (H1) leaf area, leaf fall or total fine litterfall were observed between the sites, which also had similar leaf fall N contents (mg g 21 ) and fluxes based on the data available (Fig. 2, Table S1). Aboveground NPP (H2) averaged 22% higher in the plantations than in the mature forest, primarily due to 63% faster tree growth (Fig. 5). Aboveground biomass accumulated nearly six times faster in the plantations than in the mature forest (Fig. 5). Our estimate of BCA (H3) also was significantly greater in the plantations than in the mature forest (Fig. 2) despite the fact that we ignored probable differences in coarse-root biomass accumulation rates (Table S3), which likely mirrored the six-fold differences in net aboveground biomass accumulation. This finding is consistent with data from forests from different biomes summarized by [24], who found that forests ,45 years old had relatively greater belowground C fluxes than did older forests. Overall, our findings are consistent with Fig. 1C in that both BCA and tree growth, but not canopy production, were significantly greater in the plantations than in the mature forest (Fig. 5).",

Across a range of primarily mature tropical forests in Amazonia, ,34% of estimated NPP was allocated to canopy production, with indications of a possible trade-off in allocation of production to woody stems versus fine roots [27], [60]. Such a tradeoff was inferred to be evolutionarily advantageous based on an individualbased forest growth model that was compared against empirical data [30]. Our results from mature forests and 15-20 year old plantations of native tree species in lowland Costa Rica were not consistent with such a trade-off: we found a significantly positive relationship between BCA and aboveground tree growth (Fig. 3,4). We suggest that young forest plots that are accumulating biomass [10] and are sequestering nutrients from the soil [56] reflect disequilibrium conditions, and thus are likely to have different allocation patterns than do mature forests, if allocation patterns are flexible (e.g., Fig. 1B,1C) and not fixed (Fig. 1A). Our data suggest flexibility in allocation of available growth substrates to canopies versus to root systems, with tree growth (wood production) in the plantations benefiting, in our case, from enhanced BCA. Clearly, healthy foliar canopies and root systems both contribute to ANPP: we presume that greater BCA in the experimental plantations at our site was related to soil degradation that occurred during pasture establishment and over the subsequent decades of low-level pasture management that preceded tree planting [40], [61]. This would be consistent with classical root-shoot allocation theory [12]. It also is generally consistent with a recent tree growth model [62] that posited that available C and N in trees were utilized to maximize annual wood production, with enhanced C fluxes to deep roots promoting N uptake in support of wood production. We infer that increasing allocation of C to root systems can be an important mechanism supporting high rates of tree growth and C sequestration in rapidly growing tropical forest plantations.",

Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha -1 ) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha -1 ) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha -1 ) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests.",

These mangrove ecosystem services include coastal protection from storms, climate mitigation through carbon storage and sequestration (Donato et al. 2011;Alongi 2014), and supporting functions to fisheries (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008;Barbier et al. 2011). Intense resource pressure on mangrove forests over the past century has resulted in significant declines in the global mangrove forest extent (Gorman 2018;Friess et al. 2019). The protection and restoration of mangrove forests are also considered important actions for climate change mitigation based on the high-carbon density per area of mangrove forest cover (Griscom et al. 2017(Griscom et al. , 2020)). In response to the importance of mangrove forests as a natural climate solution, international agencies and national governments have launched ambitious goals to restore mangrove forest cover across degraded estuarine and coastal areas. The United Nations, for example, has set a commitment to restore 20% of mangrove forests by 2030 (Waltham et al. 2020). Achieving these goals will require evaluating the efficacy of different restoration treatments for mangrove ecosystem services (Ellison 2000;Lee et al. 2019). The most fundamental decision when restoring any ecosystem is whether active restoration is required or whether the ecosystem will be able to recover naturally with minimum human intervention (Holl & Aide 2011). There is ample evidence that natural regeneration of mangrove forests is possible after severe disturbance, including oil spills (Duke et al. 1999), hypersalinization (Twilley et al. 1999), and hurricanes (Imbert 2018). Nevertheless, long-term recovery rates of naturally regenerating mangrove forests are highly variable.",

They require favorable environmental conditions, including appropriate tidal hydrology (Lewis 2005), fertile soil (Chen & Twilley 1998), and low wave exposure (Duke et al. 1999). Planting mangrove trees, as propagules or as nursery-grown plants, can promote faster recovery, particularly for tree biomass (Bosire et al. 2008;Ferreira et al. 2015;Das 2017;Kodikara et al. 2017). However, project costs of mangrove planting can be prohibitive, particularly over large areas (Lee et al. 2019). In some cases, mangrove planting can even result in worse ecological outcomes than natural regeneration, including decreased seedling abundance (Duke et al. 1999) and lower mangrove species richness (Rovai et al. 2012;Ferreira et al. 2015). These potential functional trade-offs point to the need for studies that evaluate costs and benefits of planting mangroves for multiple restoration outcomes (Lewis 2010). In addition to forest vegetation regrowth for carbon storage and coastal protection (Men\u00e9ndez et al. 2020), recovery of fish and invertebrate communities is a critically important restoration outcome. Fisheries recovery after mangrove restoration can translate into major economic benefits; e.g. mangrove restoration contributed nearly half a billion dollars to the fishery sector in the Indian state of Gujarat by increasing commercial fish catch (Das 2017). The supporting functions that mangroves provide to fisheries can also motivate community involvement in mangrove restoration and conservation projects (Walton et al. 2006). An underlying assumption of many mangrovereplanting projects that seek to increase fish stocks is that animals will return once habitat structure recovers, an example of a \"field of dreams\" strategy for faunal communities during restoration (sensu Hilderbrand et al. 2005). However, the successful restoration of mangrove forest structure and environmental factors does not always lead to fish biodiversity recovery.",

Fish utilization of restored mangrove habitat is also highly context-dependent based on species-specific life stages (Lewis & Gilmore 2007;Sheaves 2017). Given the current debate on when and where active restoration of mangroves is necessary (Lee et al. 2019), comparisons of fish assemblages among intact, degraded, and actively restored mangrove habitats will provide needed insight on ecosystem functions provided by mangrove restoration. In this study, we evaluate the ecological outcomes of a national-scale mangrove-replanting program in Guyana. As the vast majority of the Guyanese population and economic activities occur along the Atlantic coast, mangrove forests are considered a critical component of its national strategy to mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts, especially sea-level rise (Vaughn 2017). Mangrove forests also provide important supporting functions that benefit the fisheries sector in Guyana. A recent economic analysis indicates that mangrove deforestation has caused significant losses to Guyanese fishing revenue (Millar et al. 2019). The loss of mangrove forests has led to a national-scale restoration program to increase mangrove forest cover with the goals of improved coastal community resilience and restoration of fisheries (Anthony & Gratiot 2012). This study evaluates restoration outcomes in mangrove forests that include the main ecosystem attributes of environmental factors, vegetation structure, and fish biodiversity along the North Brazil Shelf of Guyana. We tested the following hypotheses (H): H1. Active restoration results in improved recovery of mangrove biomass, mangrove seedling abundance, and environmental conditions. H2. Conditional on H1, we hypothesized that the fish community in actively restored sites would be more similar to intact mangrove forest sites than to degraded mangrove sites.",

Planting mangrove seedlings is a common restoration technique for degraded coastal areas, with the potential for both positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services. We evaluated the outcomes of a large-scale mangrove restoration project in coastal Guyana for biodiversity, aboveground live tree biomass, and commercial fish abundance. Less than a decade after planting, mangrove biomass and seedling abundance were similar between intact and restored sites and depressed in degraded sites. However, restoration did not provide clear benefits for fish communities, including species richness and abundance. As massive mangrove planting projects ramp up to support international goals, including increasing mangrove area by 20% by 2030 (Lee et al. 2019), our results demonstrate how active restoration could provide a route to rapid recovery for some, but not all, ecosystem services. Mangrove live aboveground tree biomass in restored sites, consisting of both planted species (A. germinans) and an unplanted early-successional species (L. racemosa), reached levels equivalent to, or higher than, comparable intact sites. In contrast, live tree biomass in degraded sites remained low, indicating limited potential for natural regeneration at these sites most likely due to unsuitable environmental conditions. These biomass results are consistent with others that have shown rapid recovery in aboveground tree biomass to pre-disturbed levels with restoration (Bosire et al. 2008;Kairo et al. 2009;Ferreira et al. 2015;Sasmito et al. 2019), including higher stem density in some actively restored mangrove sites relative to comparable natural mature stands (Bosire et al. 2008). The differences between actively restored and degraded sites in our study are likely due to project managers' expertise in choosing sites for active restoration (e.g. Reid et al. 2018). The expected challenge with maintaining mangrove forests, which may have contributed to the poor recruitment of mangroves at the degraded sites, is the cyclic erosion and deposition process that characterizes mudflats along the North Brazil Shelf (Toorman et al. 2018).",

While demographic data, including growth and survival of individual mangroves, were not available for our study, collecting and analyzing these data are key to advancing our understanding of vegetation recovery during restoration (e.g. Caughlin et al. 2019). While live aboveground tree biomass reflects the immediate impacts of active restoration, mangrove seedling composition represents the potential future composition and structure of restored stands. We found evidence that active restoration resulted in comparable mangrove seedling density and diversity to mature mangrove stands (Fromard et al. 1998(Fromard et al. , 2004)). A concern with mangrove planting projects, which most often plant a single species, is that resultant mangrove stands will become monospecific plantations, rather than diverse natural stands (Rovai et al. 2012;Ferreira et al. 2015). This concern seems unwarranted in our study sites, where seedling abundance of an unplanted species (L. racemosa), considered a pioneer in coastal and estuarine habitats (Fromard et al. 2004;Jaikishun et al. 2017), also benefited from active restoration. A third taxon, Rhizophora spp., which primarily occurs inland along riverbanks where freshwater inputs to the marine ecosystem are present, was generally rare, but seedling density of this genus was also higher on average in restored sites than degraded sites. As these three genera represent the dominant floral composition of the mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf (Fromard et al. 1998(Fromard et al. , 2004)), we did not find evidence that planting a single species resulted in forest compositional changes. In contrast, the recruitment of multiple mangrove species appeared to benefit from restoration, potentially a consequence of altered environmental conditions generated by planting A. germinans. Nevertheless, the biodiversity costs of single-species mangrove planting may be higher in regions with a higher diversity of mangrove species (e.g. Southeast Asia; Ricklefs & Latham 1992).",

The mangrove restoration assessed in this study resulted from an iterative process of trial and error with early failures of mangrove replanting attributed to a lack of local expertise and knowledge on the conditions needed for mangrove growth and development (Vaughn 2017). Following the input of technical experts and training of in-country project staff following the principles of ecological restoration for mangroves (see Lewis 2005), site-level characteristics needed for successful mangrove rehabilitation were quantified (Toorman et al. 2018). These site-level assessments' key outcome was the importance of elevated mudflats in the range of +2.3 to +2.7 m above chart datum (Landell Mills Limited 2013). Thus, our assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes represents a best-case scenario based on the pre-selection of sites characterized by optimal conditions for mangrove growth and recruitment (Lewis 2005). Targeting sites with suitable geomorphic features, particularly high-elevation silt deposits, was likely a key factor in the recovery of aboveground live woody tree biomass (Cameron et al. 2019). Rigorous experiments that control for site-specific conditions will be an important next step in determining the benefits of active restoration versus no restoration actions in sites with favorable conditions for mangrove colonization, such as elevated mudflats (Atkinson & Bonser 2020). Despite the benefits of active restoration for mangrove forest structure, we did not find strong evidence for fish community recovery in planted sites. For an average fish species, abundance was more similar between degraded and restored sites than between restored and intact sites. Lower species abundance translated into lower species richness and abundance of commercially valuable species in restored sites. These findings are similar to those reported in other studies that indicate fish and invertebrate diversity remains suppressed for several years postrestoration compared to mature mangrove ecosystems (Al-Khayat & Jones 1999;Iii & Gilmore 2007;Barimo & Serafy 2020). In our sites, faunal recovery, including fish diversity and commercial fish abundance, may require a longer time than our study encompassed.",
        "ff8c61e4-3d49-4d2c-a820-25ff640fe764": "One explanation for reduced fish diversity in restored sites is the limited structural complexity of newly established mangrove forests (Laegdsgaard & Johnson 1995). As mangrove forests mature, development of fallen debris, aerial roots, and other structural features provide benefits for faunal communities, including refugia from predation, barriers from physical disturbance, and attachment points for sessile invertebrates (Hutchison et al. 2014). A related possibility is that return of the complex food web that underlies old growth mangrove forests may take longer than the initial reestablishment of mangrove stem density. One indicator of low trophic complexity in restored sites is the hyperabundance of a single algivorous species, A. anableps. In contrast, the higher abundance of fish species in the invertivore feeding guild at intact mangrove sites suggests a more complex food web structure in those sites (Brenner & Krumme 2007;Corr\u00eaa & Uieda 2007;Zvonareva et al. 2015). Longer-term monitoring of faunal communities in restored sites will be necessary to understand whether the diverse fish assemblages in intact sites will gradually return to planted mangrove forests. An alternate explanation for divergent fish community structure between intact and restored sites is that full recovery of aquatic fauna will require restoring hydrological features in addition to vegetation (Lewis & Gilmore 2007). Guyana's coastline has experienced severe alteration from coastal engineering projects, such as coastal walls and channels that have blocked freshwater discharge into oceans and altered tidal flows (Pastakia 1991). Site differences in topography and water currents can override habitat type to influence faunal communities in estuarine habitats (Vance et al. 2002). However, our analysis of environmental conditions, including salinity, turbidity, and water depth, suggests a high degree of overlap between restored and intact sites, with divergent conditions in degraded sites. Furthermore, differences among sites in the dry and wet season were generally larger than the differences between restored and intact sites during the same season.",

As improving the quality of commercial fisheries is often used to motivate local community involvement in mangrove restoration, our results suggest caution may be warranted to avoid over-promising rapid recovery of fish communities, at least in the Guyana case. Longer term, stakeholder involvement in mangrove restoration could provide an avenue for monitoring the impacts of restoration on fisheries, and ultimately improve restoration outcomes for marine fauna (Datta et al. 2012). Additionally, spatially explicit models for ecosystem recovery will be an important next step to improve our understanding of variability in mangrove restoration outcomes. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential for successful mangrove forest restoration along the North Brazil Shelf, including aboveground tree biomass recovery and recruitment of native mangrove species. These successful restoration outcomes may have been aided by engagement with coastal communities to grow mangrove seedlings, indirectly reducing anthropogenic resource use pressures on rehabilitated areas through outreach and education (Walton et al. 2006). Nevertheless, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries recovery did not occur at the rate of mangrove biomass. Highly divergent recovery times across ecosystem functions may be the norm for planted mangrove forests; for example, recovery of the deep peat layer that characterizes mature mangrove stands may require 45-80 years (Osland et al. 2020). Our study reinforces the likelihood that recovery rates for mangrove ecosystem services vary widely, even when mangrove planting projects are relatively successful.",

Funding was terminated after 7 years, while people-researcher interactions and monitoring of the restored forest and competing land uses/economic activities continued. People viewed co-occurrence of gregarious flowering induced mortality of bamboo and excessive crop/beehive damage by wildlife in the 10th year as a setback. Further, they envisioned threats to intact forest from mounting timber demand.

The plantation had 75% of belowground and 17% of aboveground carbon stocks and 39% of flowering plant species in intact forest and was economically more efficient than intact forest and farms. People did not expand the trial because of its ineffectiveness in mitigating new problems and satisfying new aspirations. Agricultural abandonment nullified restoration-mediated carbon sequestration.

Failure of achieving the Aichi Target of restoring 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020 underscores the need of enhancing effectiveness/efficiency of current restoration mechanisms to meet the Bonn Challenge of restoring 350 million hectares of degraded forests by 2030. Securing active participation of local people is one way of effecting this enhancement as indigenous knowledge can overcome the technical barriers and local resources/financial barriers in achieving desired trajectories and scales of restoration (IPBES 2018;Perring et al. 2018;Reyes-Garcia et al. 2019). Himalayan mountain system is a biodiversity hotspot spread over eight Asian countries viz., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. Traditional villages in Indian Himalaya are quite independent cultural landscapes shaped by combined works of nature and man. As farms are heavily dependent on forests for livestock feed and manure, forest restoration can induce sustainable agricultural intensification and enhance the multifunctionality of landscapes. Non-timber forest products are more crucial than timber for sustainable livelihood, as cultural values prohibit income from timber. Deforestation/forest degradation is largely an outcome of logging during 1900-1975 by government agencies for revenue generation. These agencies started restoration by planting timber species with well-established silvicultural systems from 1970 onwards through sponsored projects of 2-3-year duration. These projects, by and large, failed because local people were engaged merely as labor and wage income was too low to motivate them to protect plantations (Rao & Saxena 1994;Rao et al. 1999). Restoration using non-timber species has been neglected because of the legacies of timber-centric forest management in south Asia (Rao & Saxena 1994;Ashton et al. 2014). Empirical studies on restorative potential of locally valued non-timber species in developing countries are scarce (Rao et al. 2003;He et al.",

First, they have assessed restoration effectiveness/efficiency from chronosequences, an approach not as efficient as repeated observations in the same sites (Walker et al. 2010;Mazon et al. 2019). Second, the establishment of restoration comes from sponsored project activities, and those studies did not evaluate its long-term ecological/social outcomes, affected by surprises and setbacks emerging after cessation of funding, which seems to be inevitable in an uncertain world (Le et al. 2012;Dudley et al. 2018). Third, they did not examine competitiveness or synergy of forest restoration with other land uses and economic activities in cultural landscapes, so important for its up-scaling. Lastly, they did not target severely degraded lands. In the early 1990s, we developed a participatory communal forest restoration framework, implemented it on a pilot scale, and assessed its effectiveness/efficiency in representative tropical and temperate Himalayan villages (Rao & Saxena 1994;Maikhuri et al. 1995Maikhuri et al. , 1997;;Rao et al. 1999Rao et al. , 2003;;Saxena et al. 2001). The framework comprised a sequence of five steps: (1) Analyzing indigenous knowledge, cultural/natural heritage, and people's perceptions/preferences from the perspectives of other stakeholders; (2) Informing people the state of scientific knowledge and global perspectives they were not aware of; (3) Facilitating them to design treatments and implementation mechanisms coupling multiple concerns; (4) Arranging financial support for costs they could not afford; and (5) Involving them in monitoring/evaluation and motivating them to respond to new opportunities/challenges. All across, people dismissed any cash and free labor citing their scarcity. They offered social capital and surplus physical resources for active restoration of early-maturing high-value native species lacking in indigenous knowledge unlike many other regions (Michon et al. 2007;Douterlungne et al.",
        "0944fe72-b2bd-42db-92c9-d1cd6dd9fc13": "2007;Douterlungne et al. 2010). Initially, people were reluctant to plant trees for late returns. They gave up this reluctance after we cleared their misconception about secured early high income from early-maturing high-value species, explained them carbon/organic food markets, and enhanced their capacity to comprehend indigenous knowledge about risk reduction in mixed plantations through participatory discussions. They seemed inclined to voluntarily maintain/expand treatments and participate in scientific data collection once the trials crossed the mark of economic benefit/cost ratio of one. However, they denied formal commitments citing slow pace and uncertain success of restoration. We realized that people would actively participate in restoration designed for livelihood enhancement rather than of ecosystems sensu stricto. This realization led us to set the goal of participatory restoration as recovering ecosystem functions in degraded forests with positive impacts on residual intact forests, agroecosystems, and livelihood. Efforts were made to achieve the goal by (1) actively restoring economic species in the initial stage conforming to the social/ socio-ecological restoration concept (Fernandez-Manjarres et al. 2018); (2) selecting species that, apart from restoring degraded ecosystems, were likely to reduce pressure on residual intact forests, induce sustainable agricultural intensification, and thereby enhance landscape functions conforming to forest landscape restoration (Chazdon et al. 2016) and integrated natural resource management (Saxena et al. 2001;Reed et al. 2016) concepts;and (3) facilitating people to draw interventions based on pooled indigenous and scientific knowledge and local and external resources and respond to new challenges/opportunities conforming to adaptive co-management concept (Berkes 2009). In a temperate Himalayan village, the focus of the present study, people honored their informal commitments and absorbed significant costs of the establishment of mixed plantation of multipurpose trees, short bamboo, and medicinal herbs chosen by them by providing social fencing, farmyard manure, propagules, and logistics (Saxena et al. 2001). The plantation achieved economic benefit/cost ratio of 1.13 in the 7th year (Rao et al. 1999).",

We found that mono-Ko had a significantly higher ecosystem C sequestration rate (3.32 \u00b1 0.62 kg C m -2 yr -1 ) than others when planted in the indirect shade of pioneer species. As a non-native species, Sonneratia performed better (0.57 \u00b1 0.01 kg C m -2 yr -1 ) when planted with Kandelia than in monotypic plantations. The temporary and long-term certified emission reduction (tCER and lCER) of the 12.98 ha mono-Ko was 4103.89 and 3693.50 net CO 2 -e within 10 years, respectively. A literature review was conducted to show the compatibility of this study with other natural and plantation sites of China and Bangladesh (the native habitat for Sonneratia). The C sequestration of Sonneratia plantation sites in China is comparable with those in Bangladesh. However, the soil C accumulation rate for a Sonneratia monotypic plantation in Bangladesh decreased with age, yet the same did not occur in the plantations of China.",

Despite their very small spatial distribution (0.1% of all continental surface) (Kristensen et al. 2008;Donato et al. 2011), mangroves have the potential to cycle and trap more carbon (C) than any other ecosystem. Their C sequestration ability is a result of regular tidal inundation, muddy anaerobic soil, and their unique complex root system that efficiently traps suspended materials (Mcleod et al. 2011;Alongi 2012;Atwood et al. 2017). According to Keuskamp et al. (2013), the mangrove ecosystem can bury triple to tenfold more C than other terrestrial ecosystems. The C sequestration rate of mangroves is on average 168 \u00b1 36 g C m -2 y -1 (Breithaupt et al. 2012;Alongi 2012). As a result, mangroves draw the attention of researchers for their potential for C sequestration and as C sinks. Increasing human interference and global climate change are now causing drastic degradation of existing mangroves (Mcleod et al. 2011). However, afforestation and reforestation of mangrove species can be an effective method to increase the area of mangroves and restore degraded mangrove communities globally (Barbier 2006;Chang et al. 2006). In 1990, the natural mangroves of China were designated national/regional natural reserves. Several mangrove reforestation projects have been initiated to achieve goals such as site restoration, biodiversity, C sequestration, and natural ecological services and functions (Ren et al. 2009;Feng et al. 2019). For rapid and successful restoration, China introduced Sonneratia apetala from Bangladesh in 1985 for its fast growth rate and high environmental suitability (Chen et al. 2009).",
        "b35b16cf-e849-45f3-9901-5c88848b1fe5": "2009). S. apetala has been widely used as a pioneer species in restoration projects along the southeastern coasts of China throughout the last three decades (Lu, Yang, and Chen et al. 2014). As a pioneer afforestation species, S. apetala has accounted for more than 50% of the mangrove restoration area of China with a coverage of 3800 ha (Chen et al. 2009). S. apetala has the ability to increase stand biomass and area stability within a short period of time. It can also enhance organic C and nitrogen (N) content with its succession (Ren et al. 2008(Ren et al. , 2010)). In addition, S. apetala can transform a habitat and make it suitable for further colonization by the native species (Yu et al. 2020). Several studies have been conducted to estimate the growth and C content of mangrove plantations reforested with S. apetala in which researchers discuss the suitability of S. apetala plantation for restoration projects and the effect of plantation structure on total ecosystem C (Yu et al. 2020;Chen et al. 2012;Lu, Yang, and Chen et al. 2014;Feng et al. 2019;Ren et al. 2008Ren et al. , 2010)). Before 2010, the studies were focused on the biomass and C sequestration of monocultural stands of S. apetala (Ren et al. 2008(Ren et al. , 2010)). After that, the study of S. apetala mixed plantation with other native species has been a point of focus. Feng et al. (2019) compared native mixed plantations with exotic S. apetala and found no significant advantages of S. apetala on the stocks of organic C and nutrients except for high biomass. The output and turnover of the mangrove net primary production may have been accelerated owing to low C/N ratio for high C accumulation capacity and high litterfall production. According to Yu et al.",
        "f1e8aa3a-f3c6-4875-9029-871f45e7d8a8": "According to Yu et al. (2020), the increase of biomass stopped after 15 years of planting with native mangroves. Eventually, the vegetation C density decreased over time. However, the soil C of the stand increased even after its above-ground growth stopped, owing to the high litterfall and dead roots entering into the soil and decomposing with time. According to Gao et al. (2017), in Hainan the soil C density at a soil depth of 0-40 cm increased even after S apetala growth stopped at 13 years (Yu et al. 2020). The pioneer S. apetala also influences the regeneration and colonization of other associated mangroves. However, some studies have suggested that the native mangroves are adversely affected by the exotic species over a longer time scale (Ren et al. 2008(Ren et al. , 2010)). Since the beginning of restoration projects with S. apetala, a debate has raged about whether it is an invasive species or a restoration species. In the southern part of China, S. apetala has proved to be an invasive species threatening native mangroves (Ren et al. 2009). In the other areas, this species performed superbly in terms of site restoration, land stabilization, aboveground C accumulation, and had a positive influence on the regeneration and colonization of native mangrove species (Ren et al. 2009;Chen et al. 2012). Several studies of plantations with S. apetala and other species in different coastal regions of China gave a clear view that plantation strategy (mixture or monotypic) influences the afforested ecosystem in terms of functions and services (Lunstrum and Chen 2014;Yu et al. 2015;Feng et al. 2017;Yu et al. 2020). Studies of S. apetala in various regions have shown that the performance of mangroves depends on age and location (Feng et al. 2019).",

As a coastal city, Xiamen has the opportunity to develop mangroves to increase the region's biodiversity, purify seawater, and improve the scenic view. To offset C emissions, Xiamen started planting mangroves around Yundang Lagoon in 1990. Following this, the local government constructed a 38.7 ha mangrove plantation in Xiatanwei with the goal of producing a C-neutral BRICS summit (Liu 2017). Through this plantation, 3,095 metric tons of summit-generated C will be neutralized over 20 years and other values will be added to the environment, society, and economy (UNEP 2019). The plantation site is occupied by Kandelia obovata with the distinctive shape of \"I love China\" in Sonneratia apetala. This study was conducted in adjacent plantations of relatively young 10-year-old S. apetala and K. obovata at a similar tidal level and a mixed 15-year-old plantation in Xiatanwei, Xiamen, China. The goals of the study were: 1) to evaluate the blue C sequestration of Xiatanwei mangroves, which were planted to achieve C neutrality; 2) to assess the effect of plantation strategy on the C sequestration performance of Xiatanwei mangroves; and 3) to assess and compare the effects of plantation strategy and age on the C sequestration and annual soil C concentration rate of other Sonneratia restoration programs in China and Bangladesh, which were found through the literature review.",

Many habitats have been altered to the extent that it is no longer possible to restore their plant communities to their preexisting conditions. In these cases, a functional trait-based restoration approach to restoring some degree of ecosystem services, functionality, and structure may be helpful. To conduct functional trait-based restoration, information about the functional characteristics of species is required, and decisions are made by choosing a combination of species that have trait profiles that meet desired restoration goals. However, the value and applicability of functional trait-based restoration has been limited in its accessibility to land managers and stakeholders. The REST program is specifically designed to help users select a suite of plant species whose life history traits relate to addressing a specific management objective. Trait data from global databases have been incorporated into the program, providing some data from many species. Users define management objectives from a menu of available restoration goals (drought tolerance, fire tolerance, successional facilitation, or carbon storage) to filter for connected functional traits. Once the user has chosen appropriate functional traits for analysis, a potential species pool, chosen by the user, is required for analysis.Alternatively, users may upload their own trait and species data as a .csv file. REST then applies the statistical technique of principal components analysis to visualize species position in \"trait space.\" The program provides written and visual analysis that compares the influence of each of the functional traits. The user can run REST with various species combinations, then apply this information to decisions about which species will best meet restoration objectives.",

To date, in Costa Rica there are 54,000 ha of tree plantations and more than 50% corresponds to exotic species such as Gmelina arborea (melina) and Tectona grandis (teak) (Arce-Benavides and Barrantes-Rodr\u0131 \u00b4guez, 2004). This dominance of exotic tree species is due to two principal reasons. First, these two species have good growth and adaptability to the region. Second, reforestation programs with indigenous tree species are a recent activity, and information is still scarce on long-term species performance and silvicultural management to ensure the success of these plantings (Mora-Chaco \u00b4n, 2002;Mora-Chaco \u00b4n and Chinchilla-Mora, 2002;Piotto et al., 2003a). There is continued interest in mixed-species plantations amongst landowners and researchers in tropical and subtropical regions (Kanowski et al., 2005;Piotto et al., 2004). Benefits from the use of mixed plantation may result from better site use, improved tree nutrition, and less insect or pest damage. There may be also financial gains from combining fast-growing species that can be harvested earlier in a rotation, with more valuable species that need longer rotations. The first harvest provides an initial cash flow and also improves the growth of the remaining higher value trees (Lamb and Gilmour, 2003). However, mixed species plantations of rainforest trees are uncommon, largely because they are considered difficult to manage and harvest, and because it is difficult to assemble complementary and stable mixtures to avoid commercial failure (Lamb and Gilmour, 2003;Kanowski et al., 2005).",

This study presents results of measurements of diameter, total height, volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of nine native tree species growing in pure and mixed plantations of 12-13 years age in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. Results of previous research comparing the same experimental pure and mixed-species plantations at La Selva have shown that mixed plantations grow well, with productivities either similar or larger than the same species grown in pure plantations (Piotto et al., 2003a,b;Alice et al., 2004;Petit and Montagnini, 2004). As a consequence, mixed plantations also accumulate aboveground biomass and sequester carbon at rates comparable to pure plantations (Montagnini and Porras, 1998;Stanley and Montagnini, 1999). These same mixed plantations have also shown to contribute to recovery of soil fertility of abandoned pasturelands (Montagnini and Porras, 1998). Generally in tropical plantation forestry research results from young plantations are considered for management. However, often results from more mature plantations may differ from earlier measurement; especially because the tropical tree plantation stands' growth is very dynamic (Evans and Turnbull, 2004). For example, results from our earlier studies in the same experimental settings at La Selva had suggested that Stryphnodendron microstachyum Poepp. & Endl, Pseudosamanea guachapele (Kunth) Harms (both from the Leguminosae family) and Genipa americana L.

The present study had two main objectives. The first objective was to provide information about the growth and productivity of nine indigenous tree species growing in pure and mixed plantings. This information contributes to the development of better criteria for species selection for reforestation programs in regions with similar ecological conditions. Most of the tree species included in this study have a large natural range of distribution in Latin America. The second objective was to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon sequestration of these mixed and pure plantations (based on allometric models), in order to assess the contribution of such plantations to the increasingly important ecosystem service of carbon fixation and storage (Winjum and Schroeder, 1997). The allometric equations use mathematical relationships that convert external measurements, such as trunk diameter and sometimes height, to total tree biomass (Losi et al., 2003). This non-destructive method to estimate biomass can achieve accuracies of up to 95% and provides a model for plantations growing in similar ecological conditions (i.e. location, topography, and climate) and within the same range of diameter and height (Montero and Montagnini, 2005;Pe \u00b4rez andKanninen, 2002, 2003).",

This study aimed at evaluating the efficiency of forest restoration techniques by means of 13 qualitative and quantitative indicators for monitoring post-bauxite mining operations.

Still, natural regeneration should not be the sole option in the processes of ecosystem restoration, since planting proved to be more efficient for some indicators.",

Currently, mining is one of the main sources of raw material for industrial processes (IBRAM, 2015). In the municipality of Paragominas, in the state of Par\u00e1, bauxite-mining operations began in the 2000s, on the Mil\u00f4nia III plateau, with an initial production estimated at 4.4 million tons p.a. (Brandt, 2003). A licensed mining company has to comply with Brazilian legislation, which includes the miners' responsibility for the environmental recovery of impacted areas (Brasil, 1940, Art. 7, \u00a7 2). Thus, a mining entrepreneur must propose a Recovery Plan for Degraded Areas (PRAD) to be approved by the official body licensing his enterprise. Thus, the recovery of the degraded areas is to follow the mining operations, including the revegetation of the mined plots. The monitoring and verification of the success of the recovery and of the coherence of the actions in the field with what has been established in the Recovery Plan for Degraded Areas follow this. The said Plan should consider the technical solution that is adequate to the specific general circumstances of the site, and should have clear goals and objectives that are linked with the actions on the field, in order to favor the restoration of soil conditions that have been degraded by the mining activity, to provide future use of the resources thereof (IBRAM, 1992). Concerning this, monitoring methodologies are to be established to search for criteria and indicators that can evaluate the quality of the ecosystem recovery in various Brazilian biomes, and should be not only easily measurable, but sensitive to system stress, predictable, integrative and reliable (Durigan, 2011), taking into account the degradation factor, the specific conditions of each locality, area history, and vegetation dynamics (Andrade et al., 2014).",

To promote successful reforestation with native tree species, more knowledge is needed, particularly on effects of species identity, tree diversity, and insecticide application on tree survival and growth at different time periods after plantation establishment. We assessed these effects for three native Central American timber species and compared results gained 2 and 5 years after tree establishment. Survival, stem diameter, and tree height were quantified for Tabebuia rosea, Anacardium excelsum, and Cedrela odorata, planted in (1) monocultures, (2) three-species mixtures, and (3) three-species mixtures treated with insecticides during the first 2 years of seedling establishment. We further tested how survival and growth performance were affected by the individual tree position within reforestation tree stands to account for border effects in small-scale tree patches in pasture-afforestations. Survival was significantly affected by tree species identity with the highest survival in T. rosea and the lowest survival in C. odorata. Tree growth was affected by tree species identity, tree diversity, insecticide treatment, environmental heterogeneity, and border effects, but these effects varied across the individual tree species. Interspecific analyses revealed significant differences between species. A. excelsum trees attained the largest and C. odorata the smallest size after 5 years of growth. Across species, tree growth in years 3-5 after tree planting was highest in mixtures treated with insecticides during tree establishment, followed by monocultures and then unprotected mixtures. Enhanced growth in monocultures compared to unprotected mixtures was particularly found in T. rosea during early establishment, and in A. excelsum at a later stage of tree stand development. Growth-enhancing effects of planting schemes may be related to differential responses to herbivore damage and to treetree competition. Positive border effects, i.e.",

Our results suggest that besides early, restricted insecticide application, tree diversity within stands should be considered as management measure to enhance timber tree growth on former pasture. The finding of enhanced growth of native timber trees at the border of small tree stands suggests small patches of native timber trees planted on former pasture as a promising reforestation strategy in Latin America.",
        "5b5f3f17-fc67-4a94-8067-ff7f6a5fae6f": "Ongoing worldwide deforestation has resulted in large-scale land degradation with associated losses of biological diversity and reduced ecosystem services including carbon storage and pro-tection of soil and water quality (Dirzo and Raven, 2003;FAO, 2010). Although processes of land-use change are complex, the conversion of forests to agricultural land and pastures has been identified as the greatest direct driver of deforestation in Latin America, with 27% of the land surface now being used as cattle pastures (Geist and Lambin, 2002;FAO, 2009). To restore ecological functions and biodiversity, reforestation of degraded tropical landscapes is imperative but has to reconcile tree planting with agricultural use and landholder needs in order to be feasible in rural landscapes (Lamb et al., 2005). Examples are silvopastoral reforestations that combine native timber trees and pastures (Dagang and Nair, 2003;Wishnie et al., 2007;Riedel et al., 2013), intensive silvopastoral systems (Murgueitio et al., 2011), or the creation of woodland islets within agricultural land (Benayas et al., 2008). Such integrated reforestation on cultivated land is of conservation value as tree cover on farmland supports biological diversity by increasing landscape connectivity and by providing resources and habitat for plant and animal species (Harvey et al., 2006;Dorrough et al., 2012). Trees on farms might furthermore serve as a starting point for the re-establishment of woodland after the abandonment of land in the course of rural-urban migration (Muniz-Castro et al., 2006;Grau and Aide, 2008). However, planting trees on pastures requires an investment, and such investment is risky unless it can be based on knowledge about species ecology and performance under different environmental conditions and planting systems (Hall et al., 2011;Plath et al., 2011bPlath et al., , 2011a)).",
        "85c64b11-87db-4549-8127-e54c4003ae5b": "For tropical reforestation, planting mixtures of native tree species that provide a variety of goods and services of traditional and/or marketable value (e.g. timber) is considered particularly promising (Hall et al., 2011). Local landholders frequently maintain native trees on farmland as scattered remnant trees, as plantings around houses, or in live fences (Harvey et al., 2011) to traditionally gain fodder, shade, timber and firewood. Compared to monocultures, species mixtures might lead to higher tree performance due to favorable interactions among different tree species that reduce competition or increase facilitation or pest suppression (Forrester et al., 2005;Plath et al., 2011b). Mixtures also have the potential to enhance biodiversity conservation (Hartley, 2002) as well as to improve soil fertility and nutrient cycling (Montagnini, 2000). If trees are eventually sold for timber, product diversification through mixed stands may likewise reduce the farmers' economic risk of fluctuating price levels on local or regional markets (Kelty, 2006). However, the success of mixtures and the outcome of species interactions are highly variable and strongly depend on the selection of compatible species and appropriate planting sites (Forrester et al., 2005). Furthermore, both competitive and complementary tree-tree interactions can change over time and with increased resource utilization (Stanley and Montagnini, 1999;Delagrange et al., 2008). Herbivory is assumed to be lower in species mixtures (associational resistance; Barbosa et al., 2009;Letourneau et al., 2011) but neighbor effects depend on species characteristics of the relevant herbivores, such as host plant specialization and mobility (Jactel and Brockerhoff, 2007;Plath et al., 2012a). To protect tree seedlings from herbivores, many farmers regularly apply pesticides (Garen et al., 2009), but information on good practices and effectiveness of those pesticides under field conditions is scarce (Plath et al., 2011b).",

Since tree seedlings are particularly vulnerable to insect pests (Massad, 2012), a potential strategy might be to apply pesticides only during the early phases of tree establishment. However, no information exists about the effectiveness of this strategy in tropical reforestations with native trees. Integrating patches of trees into pastures is of high potential relevance for the reforestation of agricultural landscapes (Benayas et al., 2008). Yet, in this situation, a high proportion of overall reforested area is characterized by border area. The preponderance of border area leads to small-scale variation in environmental conditions and resource competition, which may induce differing tree growth between stand borders and the stand center (edge effects, e.g. Roberts and Harrington, 2008). If trees grow better in the stand center, a larger patch size might be preferable, whereas if trees grow better at the stand border, smaller patches or management measures such as thinning might be beneficial. Here we present results from a study on the reforestation potential of three native Central American timber species during the first 5 years after their establishment on former pasture. We tested different management practices by planting the three spe-cies in small-scale monocultures as well as in three-species mixtures with and without insecticide protection. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) How do tree species identity and tree diversity affect timber tree survival and growth 5 years after tree establishment? (2) How does plant protection by insecticides, applied in the first and second year of plantation establishment, affect the survival and growth in subsequent years? (3) How does tree survival and growth of trees at the stand border compare to that of trees in the stand center, and (4) how do border effects differ between tree species and planting schemes?",

Soil restoration following natural succession (i.e., passive restoration) is slow because of low tree establishment. Introduction of tree plantings by human intervention (i.e., active restoration) results in a promising strategy to accelerate forest succession and soil recovery in tropical region. The present research was carried out to explore the restoration of soil properties after cattle exclusion and of grazing combined with native tree planting introduction (legumes and nonlegumes) in a tropical pasture in Veracruz, southeast Mexico. Results indicate that land-use changes decreased soil C and N pools in both litter and mineral soil. In addition, soil heterogeneity increased by land-use changes at both temporal and spatial scales. In the short term, passive succession (i.e., cattle exclusion) favors the recovery of C and N content in labile soil pools, indicated by the increase in litter C and N masses as well as C and N concentrations in soil microbial biomass. Soils under active restoration showed trends to recover the N cycling, such as a greater accumulation of N in litter, in soil total N concentrations, soil microbial biomass N concentrations, rates of net N transformations, and extractable water and microbial biomass C:N ratios mainly under legumes species. Active restoration including legume introduction is a key factor for rapid recovery of soil fertility.",

Most of the tropical rain forest (TRF) area has been converted to cattle pasture (Fearnside and Barbosa, 1998;Humphries, 1998) with a great number of global environmental consequences because these ecosystems (i) exchange more water and energy with the atmosphere than any other biome (Foley et al., 2003), (ii) account for approximately 50 per cent of terrestrial nitrous oxide emissions, (iii) are responsible for nearly 40 per cent of terrestrial net primary production, and (iv) contain about 25 per cent of the world's biomass carbon (C) (Townsend et al., 2011). At local scale, the consequences of land-use change are an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, changes in the hydrological cycle, and fast soil and nutrient losses by erosion, leaching, and volatilization (Bolin and Sukumar, 2000;Neill and Davidson, 2000;Silver et al., 2004). Current evidence shows a negative effect of forest deforestation on C, N, and soil microbiota activity transforming the soil to low fertility states and resulting in less productivity (Amelung and Diehl, 1992;Davidson et al., 2007). As a consequence of reduced soil fertility, forest recovery in abandoned pasture lands is slower compared with forest recovery following other types of human or natural disturbances, as tree falls or hurricanes (Myster and Pickett, 1992;Aide et al., 1995). Ecologists have made great efforts to understand how deforestation and the later introduction of exotic grasses for grazing affect the soil bioelements dynamics (Silver et al., 2000(Silver et al., , 2004)).",
        "a64bb603-d40b-40f6-8137-b79ab9a656d1": "Results have been contradictory; for instance, one study showed that soil C and N remained unchanged in tropical forest converted to pasture (Hughes et al., 2000), whereas other have reported increases in soil C and organic P (Garc\u00eda-Montiel et al., 2000;Connant et al., 2001;Guo and Gifford, 2002). Recently, it has been reported an acute negative effect on soil N and P cycle because of deforestation and introduction of grass in tropical forest (Tob\u00f3n et al., 2011). Similarly, net N mineralization and nitrification rates have been reported as lower in the soil of forests converted to pastures compared with native forests (Neill et al., 1995(Neill et al., , 1997)). This lack of agreement among studies has been linked with the differences between environmental conditions and landscape structure (i.e., rainfall and topographic position) and the intensity of soil use and the time of pasture exploitation (Guo and Gifford, 2002;Silver et al., 2004). These data highlight the soil nutrients' sensitivity to environmental conditions and soil history of management. There are two different ways to recover the soil C and N to former levels. One way is allowing forest regeneration without human intervention by ending disturbance (passive restoration). Although this strategy is cheaper, results have been limited either by organic matter reduction and then the reduction of soil nutrient release (Tiessen et al., 1994) or by soil erosion and nutrient leaching stimulated by forest cutting (Nepstad et al., 1990;Reiners et al., 1994). The second way is using tree plantings (active restoration). Studies of plantings have shown that active restoration could be the best way to speed up the recovery of forests and soil functions after pasture abandonment (Griscom et al., 2005). However, soil C stocks reduction has been reported for tree forest plantation in pasture with high rainfall (>1500 mm) (Binkley and Resh, 1999;Rhoades et al., 2000).",

It is important to take into account that tree species affect the soil biogeochemistry in different degrees and timing altering the rate of nutrient and energy cycling (Binkley and Giardina, 1998;Kaye et al., 2002). A clear case is the increase of soil N concentration and N transformation through the rich-litter production by the N 2 -fixing species (Rhoades et al., 1998;Resh et al., 2002;Yelenik et al., 2004). In TRF, the N 2 -fixing tree species contribute with 100 to 200 kg N ha \u00c01 y \u00c01 , increasing the soil N concentration and N mineralization (Binkley and Giardina, 1998;Rhoades et al., 1998). It is generally accepted that the effect of N 2 -fixing species is in favor of soil C and N dynamics in sites with N limitation alone, which is not the case in the TRF (Russell et al., 2007). The effect of tree species on the soil may vary depending on the type of soil or landscape position, resulting in a deviation from the generalization based on species composition (Verchot et al., 2001). Therefore, it is important to know if the N 2 -fixing species have in fact an effect on the soil qualities. Los Tuxtlas Reserve at the southern state of Veracruz, Mexico offers a suitable framework to test the effect of plant introduction in pasture on the soil C and N recovery, including factors as the seasonal and topographic variation. In the late 20th century, the annual rate of deforestation reached 4\u00c13 per cent of TRF transformed to pasture. Less than 95 per cent of total aboveground biomass is kept during conversion from MF to either pasture or cropland (Dirzo and Garc\u00eda, 1992;Arroyo-Rodriguez and Mandujano, 2006).",

We compared and contrasted soil C and N concentrations after the planting of tree legumes and nonlegumes with fenced and unfenced pastures, using the MF soil as former soil conditions. The objectives of this study are the following: (i) to quantify the effect of tree plantings (i.e., legumes and nonlegumes) in an abandoned pasture on soil elements concentration; (ii) to determine the effects of cattle grazing and cattle exclusion on the soil elements and compare them with tree plantings; and (iii) to quantify the degree in which topographic positions and rainfall intervene in order to understand their effects on tree species identity.",

The results obtained in this study reveal that soil C and N contents are altered by the forest cover change after 30 years. The change in forest cover also results in an increased sensitivity of the bioelements soil concentration to the variation in season and slope position. Although we do not have the soil C and N pools immediately after the vegetation cover change to support any trend, soil C and N follow the pattern of decrease predicted by Guo and Gifford (2002) in sites with high precipitation (>3000 mm y \u00c01 ). Thus, land-use change in Los Tuxtlas from MF to pasture lands for cattle grazing decreased to 1/20th of the original amount of litter, C and N masses, as a consequence of biomass harvesting by cattle in the AP. This decrease in litter masses results in a decrease in soil C and N concentrations in different pools and also in the net N transformations, as suggested by the correlation of C and N amounts in the litter with their concentrations in the soil. Also, the high losses of C and N from the system during the slash-and-burn practice for land conversion (Giardina et al., 2000) contribute to this decrease in the C and N pools. In addition, our results for Los Tuxtlas region indicate that land-use change may   increase the high natural soil heterogeneity (Townsend et al., 2008) in physical (e.g., density and water content) and physicochemical (e.g., pH) terms at both spatial (i.e., topographic: between slope position) and temporal scales (seasonal: between rainy and dry seasons).

In contrast to passive restoration, active restoration with legumes showed a tendency to the recovery of N cycling measured as a greater accumulation of N in litter, total N concentrations, SMBN concentrations, rates of net N transformations similar to MF, and SWEC:SWEN and SMBC:SMBN ratios (Figure 2). On the other hand, soils beneath legumes showed higher values of SWEC and SMBC concentrations, among experimental covers. We cannot determine whether such increase in the rates of net N transformations beneath legumes resulted from the observed increased concentrations of SWEC and total N (thus relaxing a possible C or organic N limitations to soil microbial activity) (Binkley and Giardina, 1998;Crews, 1999), or it reflects increased soil microbial activity (an indirect consequence of increased soil microbial biomass), or both.

Although thinning provides off-site C storage (in the form of wood products) it is still not clear whether it results in an increase, a reduction or no change in on-site C storage. In this study we analyze the effect of thinning on C stocks in a long-term experiment. Different thinning intensities (moderate, heavy and unthinned) have been applied over the last 30 years in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand, with a thinning rotation period of 10 years. The main C compartments were analyzed: above and belowground tree biomass, deadwood, forest floor and upper 30-cm of the mineral soil and tree biomass removed in thinning treatments. The results revealed that unthinned stands had the highest C stocks with 315 Mg C ha -1 , moderate thinning presented 304 Mg C ha -1 and heavy thinning 296 Mg C ha -1 , with significant differences between unthinned and heavily thinned stands. These differences were mainly due to C stock in live biomass, which decreased with thinning intensity. However, soil C stocks, forest floor and mineral soil, were not influenced by thinning, all of the stands displaying very similar values 102-107 Mg C ha -1 for total soil; 15-19 Mg C ha -1 for forest floor; 87-88 Mg C ha -1 for mineral soil).

Moreover, reducing deforestation, increasing the use of forest products or creating new forests through forestation (reforestation and afforestation) are also critical to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere (Nabuurs et al. 2007). As regards the latter of these initiatives, the impact of national forestation programs on C sequestration is notably positive (e.g., Fang and Wang 2001;Kaul et al. 2010), especially when forests replace marginal agricultural lands (Jandl et al. 2007). The benefits of such policies are particularly evident in Spain, where around 4 million hectares of newly forested areas (both afforested and reforested from 1940(both afforested and reforested from to 2006(both afforested and reforested from (SECF 2011))) play an important role as C sinks (Padilla et al. 2010;Herrero and Bravo 2012;P\u00e9rez-Cruzado et al. 2012). The growth of these new forests leads to C sequestration both in the tree biomass and in the soils. Live biomass C is a forest compartment which grows rapidly during the first years following afforestation. However, soil C increases slowly (Post and Kwon 2000) and sometimes the short-term effects are negligible due to the C stock decrease in the first years and further recovery (Paul et al. 2002). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the soil C stock is a long-lived pool (Lal 2004a). The C accumulation rates in biomass and soil could be increased through different forest management strategies, such as adapting the composition of forest species, employing longer rotation periods, soil conservation or thinning (Bravo et al. 2008).",

Thinning treatments aimed at achieving silvicultural objectives also aid in the mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of global change by enhancing forest C stores and by maintaining high levels of compositional, functional and/or structural complexity (D 'Amato et al. 2011). Furthermore, it has been suggested that C storage in wood products could provide a more viable long-term climate mitigation strategy than on-site sequestration (Niles and Schwarze 2001;Valsta et al. 2008), depending, among other factors, on site productivity and conditions to enable products to be harvested and used efficiently (Marland et al. 1997). In many of the abovementioned reforested areas of Spain, little or no silvicultural interventions have been applied. Therefore, these forests currently display a high degree of homogeneity as well as high densities, and urgently require the application of thinning treatments to ensure their viability as providers of goods and services, including their function as C sinks. In this paper we investigate the influence of thinning on forest C stocks through a long-term research trial in which forest management has been applied over 30 years, in order to determine whether these activities affect the mitigation capacity of the afforestation. The trial was carried out in a Pinus sylvestris L. afforestation, which is currently mid-way through the rotation period. This species was one of the most commonly used in the Spanish plantation program, accounting for over 0.6 million hectares (Valbuena-Caraba\u00f1a et al. 2010). The specific objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of different thinning intensities (moderate and heavy), in comparison to unthinned stands, on the C stocks in the different forest compartments: i) above and belowground tree biomass; ii) deadwood; iii) soil, forest floor and mineral soil; and iv) tree biomass harvested in thinning operations.",

This coincides with the results of other studies concerned with the long-term effects of different management practices on C stocks, which reported differences in the amounts of C in the live tree biomass component (e.g., Powers et al. 2011;Simon et al. 2012;Ruiz-Peinado et al. 2013). When the C stock harvested in thinning operations was added to the biomass C stock (onsite and off-site biomass C stock), differences were also found to exist between the unthinned treatment and heavily thinned stands. This loss of biomass production exhibited by heavily thinned stands in relation to the production of unthinned stands has already been reported in several long term thinning trials in Scots pine stands located in different European regions in terms of volume growth (Chroust 1979;M\u00e4kinen and Isom\u00e4ki 2004;R\u00edo et al. 2008). In Spain, R\u00edo et al. (2008) identified a critical basal area, according to Assmann (1970), of 83 % of the unthinned stand in the case of natural Scots pine thinning trials, i.e. the percentage of basal area in relation to the basal area in unthinned stands in which 5 % of the volume growth was lost. In our thinning trial the plots had a mean basal area in the last inventory of 74 % for the moderate thinning and 63 % for the heavy thinning treatments in relation to the unthinned plots, with a loss of 6 % and 8 % respectively in total biomass. These values indicate a lower critical figure than that reported by R\u00edo et al. (2008), suggesting a better response to thinning in this trial, probably due to the younger age of the stand (Chroust 1979;Kramer and R\u00f6\u00f6s 1989), approximately half the rotation age.",
        "1d12db88-9c46-4643-89e6-8d45a6fb6ee8": "Hence, it is important that the trial is maintained for the full duration of the rotation period in order to evaluate the overall effect of thinning on total C stocks. Moreover, the early thinning applied in the trial appears to be more appropriate as a mitigation strategy than late thinning given the better diameter growth response to thinning found in Scots pine at young ages (Peltola et al. 2002;M\u00e4kinen and Isom\u00e4ki 2004;del R\u00edo et al. 2008). The differences in live tree biomass C stock between treatments are mainly explained by the lower densities and basal areas maintained in thinned stands (Table 1). These lower stocking levels might have consequences in terms of litterfall input (needles, bark, deadwood or rootlets) and therefore, could also affect the amount of forest floor and deadwood components. A reduction in litterfall with thinning intensity was reported in Spain for Pinus pinaster (Roig et al. 2005) and P. sylvestris (Blanco et al. 2006), although in the case of the former, the effect of thinning on litterfall was found to disappear 5 years after treatment and in the case of the latter, this temporal effect could not be verified due to the short-term nature of the study. In contrast to other studies (e.g., Vesterdal et al. 1995;Jonard et al. 2006) we found no differences in forest floor C stock among the different thinning intensities tested. Litterfall, decomposition ratios and harvesting methods may have a bearing on this finding. In our study, the use of stem-only harvesting allowed logging residue to remain in the stand, hence there was no significant decrease in the C stock of this compartment. However, the H treatment exhibited the lowest value (14.7 Mg C ha -1 ), suggesting a lower litter supply and possibly a greater micro-climatic effect of thinning on decomposition, as reported in other studies (e.g., Vesterdal et al. 1995;Skovsgaard et al. 2006).",

A probable increment in soil temperature and greater soil water content due to the lower stand density in the heavy thinning treatment might lead to an increase in the decomposition rate and forest floor reduction (Aussenac 1987). However, Blanco et al. (2011) in their Scots pine thinning experiments found differences in needle decomposition rates in thinned stands in comparison to unthinned stands, the rates being higher in unthinned plots, although they did not identify changes in soil temperature and soil moisture. Neither forest floor bulk density nor mineral soil bulk density increased as a result of compaction during thinning operations (Table 3), as stated in other studies (e.g., Jandl et al. 2007;Schulp et al. 2008). Leaving logging residues on the floor could also help minimize soil compaction, thus helping to maintain soil C stocks (Han et al. 2006;Page-Dumroese et al. 2010). In the thinned stands, the greater bulk densities found in the deepest layer sampled (20-30 cm) (Table 3) may also be associated with the more rapid soil decompaction in upper layers of the mineral soil (Froehlich et al. 1985). As regards the deadwood component (Table 2), the largest amount of fine woody debris in thinned plots may be associated with the stem-only harvesting method used in the trials. The fine woody debris compartment comprised the greatest percentage of woody debris (more than 90 % in all treatments), while logs and snags made up only a small fraction, even in the unthinned treatment, probably as a consequence of the low mortality rate. The single largest C pool is the mineral soil, the current global stock amounting to around 383 Pg C, which represents 44 % of the total C stock in world forests (Pan et al. 2011).",
        "54505f0e-c542-4fa5-8466-5e64de413150": "2011). In this study, the soil C stock accounted for 34 % of the total C stock in the U treatment, 39 % in the M treatment and 42 % in the H treatment. The potential for C sequestration in the soil and consequent contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change is deemed to be high, especially as a result of the afforestation of marginal agricultural land (e.g., Lal 2004b;Jandl et al. 2007). Although the sequestration rate in soils may be lower than in biomass (Jandl et al. 2007), the residence times are longer and the C is often sequestered for centuries. The soil C stock in the studied Scots pine stand varied from 102 to 107 Mg C ha -1 , including forest floor and the upper 30-cm of mineral soil (Table 2). These results are in accordance with those of other studies of this species. In Central Spain, D\u00edaz-Pin\u00e9s et al. (2011) found between 90 and 140 Mg C ha -1 (to a depth of 50-cm) in natural stands and Charro et al. (2010) reported a higher figure of 166 Mg C ha -1 (to a depth of 20-cm) in a reforested stand. In Europe, Janssens et al. (1999) reported C stocks of 144 Mg C ha -1 in a Belgian plantation of P. sylvestris (to a depth of 1-m) and Schulp et al. (2008) reported an amount of 98 Mg C ha -1 (to a depth of 20-cm) in a plantation of the same species in the Netherlands. The C stock contained in the first layer considered in this study (0-10 cm) was as large as the combined stock of the other two layers considered (10-20 cm and 20-30 cm), highlighting the importance of the mineral soil upper layer as a C pool (Table 5).",
        "be16dc57-87bc-4b6a-91a9-452339921b25": "Hence, it is particularly important that disturbances to the upper part of the mineral soil are minimized to avoid C loss. As regards forest management, this may imply the use of more 'friendly' harvesting techniques. The C stock data for the forest floor and mineral soil suggest that the three, 10-yearly thinning operations performed to date have not had a significant impact on soil C. The same finding was reported in other studies concerning the influence of management systems on C stocks (e.g., Skovsgaard et al. 2006;Chatterjee et al. 2009;Jurgensen et al. 2012) including a recent thinning study conducted in southern-central Spain (Ruiz-Peinado et al. 2013) and focusing on Mediterranean maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Thinning recommendations for Scots pine in the study area (del R\u00edo et al. 2008) advise heavy thinning interventions at early stages, as in our trials, and light thinning in the second half of the rotation, which should reduce the potential impacts of thinning on this compartment. Given the finding that thinning has no effect on soil C stocks, combined with the fact that the live tree biomass compartment (both above and belowground) contained the largest C stock in the forest (around 62 % for U, 55 % for M and over 51 % for the H treatment) it may be concluded that the live tree biomass along with the biomass removed in the thinning treatments could be used as indicators for monitoring the sustainability of forest management in terms of C sequestration. As previously mentioned, thinning operations in this Scots pine afforestation involve a small loss of production (total biomass, including also removed biomass) which slightly reduces the mitigation capacity of this kind of afforestation. However, it is important to take into account the C sequestrated in wood products, which depends to some extent on the type of thinning applied. Thinning from below is the most favorable since it concentrates the growth on the largest trees, increasing the amount of merchantable wood (Hoover and Stout 2007).",
        "aee8245d-1ece-4ba9-baa9-b981f9785a60": "Most of the pine plantations in Spain were established to provide a protective function; hence, wood production was not the main objective. Today, multi-objective management is considered more appropriate in most of these forests in order to address issues such as soil protection or wildlife habitat creation whilst also taking into consideration the role of forests as C sinks both on-site (biomass and soil) and off-site (wood products or bioenergy). Since large agricultural areas were forested using Pinus species and later received little or no silvicultural intervention, many of these pine forests are now highly homogenous in terms of composition, age structure, high densities and continuous extensions of forested surface, requiring the application of thinning treatments to maintain their stability. This study highlights the sustainability of thinning treatments with regard to C stocks since the soil C stock is not affected and the loss in terms of total biomass is small (8 %) during the first half of rotation. Furthermore, the use of harvested wood products from the thinning operations could play a key role as a mitigation strategy, particularly in areas with high fire risk.",

The role of mangrove forests in mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation is well recognized. The present field study aimed to estimate the carbon stocks of Mahanadi Mangrove Wetland (MMW), east coast of India.

The mean of carbon stock in natural stands was 143.4 \uf0b1 8.2 Mg C ha -1 (vegetation 89.1 \uf0b1 8.9 and soil 54.3 \uf0b1 3.0 Mg C ha -1 ) and plantation at 151.5 \uf0b1 7.9 Mg C ha -1 (vegetation 90.6 \uf0b1 16.2 and soil 60.9 \uf0b1 5.6 Mg C ha -1 ).

A positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in the surface soil (0-30 cm), indicating the role of vegetation in building surface soil/sediment organic carbon. The 6651 ha of mangrove forests in the MMW is estimated to store 0.98 Mt of C, which is equivalent to 3.59 Mt of CO 2 e.The present study reveals that MMW stores substantial amount of atmospheric carbon and therefore needs to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as increase carbon storage. Further, mangrove plantations, on a per unit area basis, can sequester as much carbon as natural stands.",

The annual increment of A. cadamba trees reached its maximum point or the intersection between MAI and PAI at the age of 8 years, showing the maximum production of A. cadamba trees. Forest plantation of A. cadamba produced biomass and carbon sequestration of 81.90 ton ha -1 and 39.31 ton ha -1 , respectively at the age of 8 years. However, the amount of biomass and carbon in another plot of A. cadamba trees was 96.85 ton ha -1 and 46.49 ton ha -1 , respectively.

However, the increasing rate of deforestation and the impact of land-use changes need to be concerned prior to preventing the loss function of tropical forests. This work emphasizes the role of bulk density as the main driver of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stock in four land-use categories i.e natural forest, tree plantations, cropland and degraded soil (Tesfaye et al. 2016). In addition, the intense expansion of forest usage as the effect of human activities becomes a main focus to be solved especially the increased use of timber products (Hansen et al. 2013). Therefore, the development of more effective ways to reduce the illegal harvest activities should be done to protect the tropical forest diversity (Ruslim et al. 2016). Birdsey and Pan (2015) had reviewed on how the function of forest has been changed in recent decades and summarized those implications for global carbon stocks. Although studies of specific management activities, including fertilization system, genotypes and species, site preparation and competition control have been applied in the industrial field trials for decades, the effect of these changes in the ecosystem level and in the interaction between land and atmosphere is still not been focussed, yet. Explicit comparisons of management effects using paired sites are rarely used (Herbst et al. 2015). More often extrapolations are based on the level of land use (Domec et al. 2015). The amount of this nutrient depletion depends on species characteristics, growth rate, tissue nutrient content, the period of harvesting rotation, the use of harvesting methods and nutrient reserves in the soil (Arias et al. 2011). The mineralization of terrestrial detritus is primarily driven by soil microbes (Hobara et al. 2014;Hawke et al. 2015). The control of nutrient availability for plant uptake and soil microbes also drive C and N fluxes to the atmosphere and waterways. Multiple meta-analyses based on hundreds of studies have shown that the addition of N usually decreases the soil microbes that produce C (Lu et al.",
        "43ebc6e6-e9a1-42da-a35f-bab61f09f1b9": "2011). Conversely, P addition can either increase (Liu et al. 2012) or decrease (Groffman and Fisk 2011) forest soil microbial C regardless of the nutrient status of plants growing in the site (Turner and Wright 2014). Increasing the rotation length would also increase the biomass carbon stock (Gonzalez-Benecke et al. 2015;Sharma et al. 2016;Panwar et al. 2017). The assessment of the whole potential of biomass carbon stock, and other potentials in order to change management activities is urgently needed for balancing the economic productivity with another ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, the sustainability of soil health and water resources. This is important because the efforts to pursuit different management goals is very costly, but the established tools to evaluate the trade-offs is not ready, yet. (Birdsey and Pan 2015;Law and Waring 2015;Noormets et al. 2015), A. Cadamba, one type of local Indonesian plants, is known as popular plants for forest plantation. A. cadamba trees can grow very rapidly with straight stands and its wood is qualified as one of the best raw materials in forestry industries such as plywood, furniture, pulp, paper, board and matches (Mansur and Tuheteru 2011). The nature of tree as carbon sinks is one of the most effective ways to capture greenhouse gas. The ability of fastgrowing species to absorb carbon more rapidly compared with the slow-growing tree species is one of the reason for highly plantation of these trees in the private forest lands (Murdiyarso 2003;Chauhan et al. 2016a). In addition, forest plantation for wood production mostly provides environmental services such as water regulator and carbon absorber (Kanninen 2010;Chauhan et al. 2016b). These services can be sold to beneficiaries parties through Payment for Environmental Services (PES) (Wunder 2005).",

Some studies on optimal cycles in the forest plantation revealed that carbon for an environmental service has been included as an income source rather than wood in Europe and America (Van Kooten et al. 1995;Tasson et al. 2004;Galinato andUchida 2010, 2011;Olschewski and Betitez 2010;Chauhan et al. 2015). Replacing one tree species with another one can considerably alter the functions of key forest ecosystem (Binkley and Menyailo 2005). Differences among species in growth rate, tissue nitrogen (N) concentrations, allocation to wood, foliage, and roots, litter chemistry, and mycorrhizal associations cause differences in net primary productivity (NPP), decomposition, soil carbon (C) storage, and N cycling (Crowley et al. 2016). However, the sustainability of fast-growing plantations may also be compromised. This occurs when the large amounts of nutrients removed biomass at the end of the rotations can not be compensated by nutrient inputs through fertilization, atmospheric deposition, or nitrogen biological fixation (Laclau et al. 2010). Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the increment of A. cadamba forest plant, and analyze the effect of forest plantation of A. cadamba on the production of biomass and carbon indicated by the value of coefficient of determination.",

The study tests the effects that 10 soil-preparation treatments before planting exerted on SOC, evaluates the effects of land-use change on SOC, and simulates SOC dynamics using the RothC model. The land-use changes studied were from cereal crops to abandoned croplands and from cereal crops to afforestation, in comparison to a native forest in equilibrium (maximum SOC reached). The results show that there were no differences in SOC among the soil-preparation treatments applied 20 years ago. An increasing mean SOC was recorded in the afforestation subplots. These increases were not always significant from one sampling period to another and were related to silvicultural practices and climate. SOC in the afforested land was influenced by the soil carbonate content (+), pH (\u00c0), and pine density (+). After 20 years, the mean SOC values in the afforested land were higher than in abandoned croplands and cereal crops (12.23 Mg C ha \u00c01 , 9.52 Mg C ha \u00c01 and 8.02 Mg C ha \u00c01 , respectively) though no statistical differences were registered among these land uses. In all cases SOC differed with respect to the native pine forest, which showed 40.59 Mg C ha \u00c01 . Our results indicated that not enough time had elapsed to detect significant cumulative effects in SOC due to slow dynamics of carbon in the soil in the semiarid climate, the low inputs of organic matter to the soil and, probably, the low soil clay content in the study area. At the end of this study, the SOC in the afforested area was 69.9% less than in the native pine forest, indicating a clear potential for SOC sequestration in the following years.

In fact, one of the main strategies to mitigate climate change is based on the soil functioning as a carbon sink (IPCC, 2001a;Lal, 2015). In this sense, in 2003 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published (Penman et al., 2003) a Good Practices Guide for the Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). Despite that the afforestation of agricultural land was included among these good practices, soil processes occurring after farmland afforestation are not well known. Uncertainties persist related to increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and accumulation rates, and the factors involved remain unclear (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010), especially in semiarid Mediterranean environments (Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2015;Ruiz-Sinoga et al., 2011). It is widely known that factors determining SOC are: climate (mainly temperature and precipitation), soil features (mineralogy, soil clay content, cation-exchange capacity, pH, etc.), and factors related to land use and silvicultural practices (Smith, 2008). These factors combined affect the quality and quantity of the organic matter to be incorporated into the soil and its mineralization, thereby influencing the carbon-sequestration mechanism. Site preparation prior to afforestation is the silvicultural management most commonly used to accelerate and improve the forest restoration activities (L\u00f6f et al., 2012). Different soil-preparation techniques prior to afforestation create microenvironments for the growing trees by altering the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils. Also, in semiarid regions the effects on soil proprieties depend on the level of soil disturbance and several studies have even recommended a combination of treatments (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010;Querejeta et al., 2001;Wang et al., 2016).",
        "11264d37-5ee4-44b4-8f5f-ec435185d300": "However, some authors have reported contradictory results with regard to the effects of soil-preparation techniques in SOC (Garcia-Franco et al., 2014;Maestre and Cortina, 2004), emphasizing the need for further studies. Although there is currently no consensus about the general afforestation effects on SOC sequestration and the factors involved (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010;Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2015;Post and Kwon, 2000;Zhang et al., 2013), it is accepted that SOC initially decreases after afforestation and then gradually increases until reaching a steady state (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010;Paul et al., 2002). However, there are unknowns related to climate variability, site preparation before afforestation, plantation age, tree species, and the stand characteristics (tree density, basal area, canopy cover, etc.), as well as the forestry practices, among others. Regarding land use and land-use change, SOC can be found to be: (i) in the steady-state equilibrium (IPCC, 2001b), (ii) declining, by erosion (Nieto et al., 2012), fire (Mart\u00ed-Roura et al., 2011), and tillage (Nieto et al., 2010), or (iii) augmenting, by agricultural conservation (Smith, 2008), agricultural abandonment, and subsequent secondary succession (Novara et al., 2014), or by afforestation of agricultural soils (Paul et al., 2002(Paul et al., , 2003;;Romany\u00e0 et al., 2000). In this sense, there is also a large potential to sequester soil carbon in arid and semiarid crops due to the scant carbon content, between 0.8 and 1.7% (Lal, 2002), in comparison to systems in steady state or equilibrium (IPCC, 2000;Nieto et al., 2012).",
        "74b77d58-97c7-4928-8029-c42ae161ae96": "In these areas, the main reasons for the low SOC value are: (i) historical legacy of degradation and overexploitation, from the standpoint of agriculture, livestock, and forestry, with insufficient organic matter inputs to restore soil fertility (Gonz\u00e1lez de Molina, 2002;Montiel Molina, 2006;Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00edn et al., 2016), and (ii) lower productivity than in other climates. However, SOC accumulation is favoured because the microbial activity in semiarid areas is minimal and the mineralization index of the organic matter is very low (Freibauer et al., 2004). Therefore, land-use changes such as cropland abandonment or afforestation would mean a significant form of carbon sequestration. Furthermore, potential carbon sequestration in semiarid regions could have stronger relevance considering the organic carbon in both living biomass of vegetation and soil (Garcia-Franco et al., 2014;Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2007;Novara et al., 2014;Pardos, 2010). In general, without great alterations, the forest plantations or lands under secondary succession continue to absorb carbon for a few decades, depending on the species and local conditions, until reaching the state of equilibrium, after some 100 years (Smith, 2004). This process is reversible and the carbon stock could remain stable as long as there are no changes in soil-management practices, land-use changes or environmental catastrophes (fires, climate change, etc.). Recent studies indicate that semiarid regions and their ecosystems merit increased attention as a key to understanding the variations in the global carbon cycle (Ahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2015;Korkan\u00e7, 2014). Unfortunately, the factors that influence the changes in soil carbon stocks following afforestation remain uncertain on regional scales (Zhang et al., 2013).

Information is scarce on the functional balance of nutrients within ecosystems where mixtures of N 2 -\u00aexing and non-N 2 -\u00aexing plants are managed. Nutrient dynamics in relation to plantation age are important, given that the structure and function of plantations do not remain constant as stands mature.

While this highlights how mangrove conservation can promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, deforestation and degradation of mangroves continues to be a major threat to their existence. Deforestation, a land use and land cover (LULC) defined here as the complete removal of a mangrove forest or stand of mangrove trees where the land is thereafter converted to a nonforest use, has occurred globally at a rate of 1 to 2% per year. Loss of mangrove forests has largely been due to conversion of mangrove forests to shrimp and fish aquaculture, rice, oil palm plantations, and urban development. In Southeast Asia, where 60% of the world's mangroves are found (FAO, 1994;Spalding, 2010), more than 114,000 ha of mangrove forests (2.5%) have been converted to aquaculture ponds, rice or oil palm from 2000 to 2012 (Richards and Friess, 2016). Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds in Indonesia, Central America, and the Caribbean has resulted in C stocks 2-8 times lower than adjacent pristine mangrove forests (i.e., C loss of 554 \u00b1 230 Mg C ha \u00c01 assuming that baseline conditions of deforested sites were similar to pristine ones (Kauffman et al., 2017a)). Similar impacts are expected to occur across SE Asia with mangrove deforestation, yet few studies have quantified this despite the large areas of mangroves there, the high rates of deforestation, and the potential loss of large amounts of terrestrial C. Forest degradation is a LULC characterized by a change in the original forest condition through disturbances such as illegal cutting for fuelwood, burning, or human structures that compact soils or alter hydrology. Forest degradation can also be caused by natural phenomena such as cyclones, diseases, die back, tsunami etc.",

As a result, degraded sites, unlike deforested sites, still support some forest structure and thus land cover that can be difficult to quantify from remote sensing. This suggests that while degraded sites may have lower TEC stocks compared to pristine forests, they will likely be greater than deforested mangroves. Furthermore, if degradation is not included as a LULC, field or remote sensing assessments may overestimate TEC stocks of mangrove forests. To offset losses from deforestation as well as to reduce C emissions, several countries and non-governmental agencies have invested heavily in projects to restore mangroves by planting monospecific stands of Rhizophora sp. (Wylie et al., 2016). While many of these restoration projects have failed for various reasons (Lewis and Gilmore, 2007;Primavera and Esteban, 2008), it is unclear if the successful mono-specific plantations store similar levels of C as the once diverse pristine systems they replace and thus how effective these projects are at restoring C stocks of mangroves. As the number of TEC stock assessments have increased over the past decade, it has become clear that the C storage can vary substantially across global regions and within countries. For example, across Southeast Asian mangroves, TEC varied from 442 to 1267 Mg C ha \u00c01 (Murdiyarso et al., 2015) and from 154 to 1484 Mg C ha \u00c01 in West-Central Africa (Kauffman and Bhomia, 2017).

Using an adequate number of plots to accurately estimate TEC stocks coupled with a random and intensive grid approach would cover the entirety of existing mangrove ecosystems and effectively capture spatial variability of TEC stocks at a country level. A grid approach for national assessments would also allow the development of higher tier level emission factors that would increase the accuracy and credibility of national reporting and the capacity of participation in voluntary C markets. The primary goal of this study was to conduct an intensive country-wide assessment of TEC stocks in mangrove forests across Cambodia to address the following objectives: (1) compare TEC stocks across various mangrove LULC types (pristine, deforested, degraded, and restored); and (2) examine regional patterns in mangrove TEC stocks across Cambodia. We hypothesized that: (H1) TEC stocks would be highest in pristine mangroves because of C loss from timber extraction and soil degradation in deforested and degraded plots; (H2) TEC stocks would be greater in degraded plots than deforested plots due to the forest structure that still remains in degraded plots after the harvest of a few select trees versus complete clear cutting of deforested plots; and (H3) restored mangrove plots would have lower TEC than pristine mangrove plots due to the young age and development of the above and belowground forest biomass.",

As such, the number of mangrove C stock assessments have significantly increased as countries start to include mangrove C into their nationally determined contributions. The national assessment that we conducted across mangroves in Cambodia revealed the impact of LULC on those C stocks and the need to quantify and include C stocks from those different LULC in national reports or participation in C credit markets. Our results also revealed the importance of mangrove conservation, the potential value of sustainable harvesting, and the success that mangrove plantations have at restoring C stocks. TEC stocks from pristine mangroves had 60% more C than deforested mangroves, but did not significantly differ from degraded sites. Therefore, we were only able to partially accept our 1st hypothesis that TEC stocks would be highest in pristine mangroves compared to deforested and degraded plots as this only held true for pristine and deforested plots. TEC stocks were also significantly greater in degraded plots than deforested plots, supporting our 2nd hypothesis. TEC stocks from 25-year-old restored plots did not significantly differ from pristine mangrove forest plots and we rejected our 3rd hypothesis that pristine mangroves would store higher TEC stocks than restored ones, at least in the case of studied sites in northern Cambodia.",

However, little is known about how soil C and N compositions in subtropical forests evolve after decades of reforestation. This study comprehensively evaluated the differences in soil C and N fractions in 40-and 80-year-old secondary (reforested) coniferous forests and a natural broadleaf forest. Although reforestation with coniferous plants appeared to increase soil organic matter and labile C levels, the ratio of soil labile C to total organic C was lower in the reforested coniferous forests than the natural broadleaf one. The trend in the labile N to total N ratio as coniferous reforestation progresses follows that of C. Furthermore, the percentage of recalcitrant C as total soil organic C was higher in the reforested coniferous forests than the natural broadleaf one. This feature of C composition in reforested coniferous forest causes environmental stress to microbes (as indicated by a high metabolic quotient) in the forest, even several decades after reforestation of a former broadleaf forest site. Results from this study demonstrate that it takes a very long time for reforestation with coniferous vegetation to restore the soil chemical properties of the previous natural forest.",

However, deforestation and land use changes have reduced the global forest cover (Flynn et al., 2009;Hurtt et al., 2006), biomass production, and soil and water qualities (Lal, 2004) over the last few decades. Reforestation has become an important way to recover soil quality and wildlife habitats that have degraded due to the adverse impacts of deforestation (FAO, 2010;Richter et al., 1999). Soil biochemical and chemical properties respond to reforestation, though it may take a long time for them to return to natural conditions (Chodak & Nikli\u0144ska, 2010). For example, it was shown that soil C and N contents in a karst region increased and environmental stress to soil microorganisms (i.e., metabolic quotient, qCO 2 ) decreased as reforestation progressed (Hu et al., 2016). These improvements in soil properties can be related to the type of tree used for reforestation (Mo et al., 2016). The tree type in a plantation also affects soil conditions such as microbial community (Ushio et al., 2008), soil nutrients, and mycorrhizal fungi community (Holste & Kobe, 2016). Oulehle et al. (2007) found lower soil pH in coniferous than broadleaf forests because of their different litter qualities. Disturbances from human activity during forest conversion could increase soil bacterial diversity more in a reforested coniferous plantation than a natural broadleaf forest (Lin et al., 2011). In addition, Chang et al.",

(2016) showed that total fungal content, fungi to bacteria ratio, and Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio were higher in a reforested coniferous plantation than a nearby natural broadleaf forest soil, and they attributed this to the quality of the soil organic matter (SOM). These changes in soil microbial communities could be linked to changes in soil physiochemical properties and the litter quality of plants (Arunachalam et al., 1996;Chang et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2000). Indeed, several studies have shown degraded soil C and N contents after reforestation. Lu et al. (2014) found that soil total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were lower in a pine plantation forest than a natural broadleaf forest in southwestern China. Similarly, Pizzeghello et al. (2017) found lower soil TOC, alkyl C, and aromatic C contents in reforested land than adjacent natural forests. Soil labile C and N linked to plants in reforested land are part of the soil C and N cycle (Lu et al., 2012), and they influence the soil microbial community (Nishiyama et al., 2001). Research has shown that soil KCl-and hot water (HW)-extractable C and N contents reflect the nutrients that can be readily metabolized by soil microorganisms, while acid-hydrolyzable C is considered to be bioreactive C in soil (Xu et al., 1997). Extraction methods, such as KCl and HW, have been widely used to study various forest ecosystems and have proven that KCl-and HW-extracted C and N contents are directly linked to microbial biomass (Huang et al., 2014;Shiau et al., 2017;Shiau & Chiu, 2017).",

Thus far, the changes in soil labile C and N, acid hydrolyzable C, and recalcitrant C contents have not been adequately evaluated in reforested plantations. Here, we aimed to better understand the changes in soil chemical properties by analyzing C and N groups after long-term reforestation using 40-and 80-year-old secondary (reforested) coniferous plantations and an adjacent natural broadleaf forest. We hypothesized that the ratios of soil labile C to TOC and N to TN are lower in the young secondary coniferous forest than the natural forest because most of the C from coniferous litter goes to resistant soil organic carbon (SOC), which is less readily available for microbial metabolism.",

The litter and SOM from coniferous plants typically contain higher aromatic C and alkyl C than those from broadleaf forests (Jien et al., 2011), which makes this litter and SOM resistant to decomposition and benefits of C and N accumulation in soils (Chang et al., 2016). This explains the higher soil TOC and TN contents and the lower labile C to TOC ratio in the conifer forest sites than the natural broadleaf one. The similar soil C and N fractions between CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat sites imply that soil chemical properties in the reforested coniferous plantations would ultimately reach a stage of succession similar to those of the natural forest, despite having different plant types. Soil soluble N from compounds like NH 4 + KCl , NO 3 -KCl , and TDN KCl was higher in CONIF-40 than either BROAD-Nat sites, and this could be linked to the fact that young forests have more young leaves than do old forests. Soil organic C is not polar and therefore dissolves better in HW than under ion exchange (Shiau et al., 2017;Shiau & Chiu, 2017). Therefore, S b OC HW concentrations were higher than those of S b OC KCl at all three studied sites, and S b OC HW is typically considered to reflect the labile portion of soil C better than S b OC KCl (Shiau & Chiu, 2017). The differences in litter qualities provided by the coniferous and broadleaf forests also influenced the acid-hydrolyzable C contents among the soils of the three studied sites.",

The reforested coniferous areas had lower ratios of labile C or N to total C or N and higher RP-C/TOC ratio than native broadleaf ones; this concurs with the observation that soil microbial biomass is lower in secondary coniferous plantations than in natural broadleaf forests (Chang et al., 2016). Moreover, the soil AHPI-C, AHPII-C, and RP-C contents in CONIF-80 were similar to those in BROAD-Nat, indicating that it may take a very long time for reforested soil organic C composition to reach that of natural forests. In the summer, high temperatures and soil water content increase the microbial biomass of forest soils (Chang et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2012), leading to accelerated SOM decomposition (Swift et al., 1979). This explains why higher HW-and KCl-extracted C was observed in the summer for all three forest soils. Metabolic quotient (qCO 2 ) is a useful a posteriori indicator for determining the ecological efficiency of soil microbial communities (Anderson & Domsch, 1990;Degens, 1998). The low microbial biomass C and N contents but high qCO 2 values in the CONIF-40 soil imply that microbes in this soil were under greater stress than those in the CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat soils, similar to the trend from microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis by Chang et al. (2016). This may be explained by significantly lower labile C and N to total C and N ratios in the CONIF-40 than CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat soils, which may have created an adverse environment for microbial growth.",

We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture, restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the degradation of tropical forests.

However, tropical forests are experiencing historically high levels of deforestation, with approximately 100 million hectares lost in recent years [8]. The conversion of forest areas into agricultural lands and pastures [2,9,10] and the global expansion of commercial agriculture or agribusinesses (e.g., cattle ranching, soybean farming and oil palm plantations) have led to high levels of tropical deforestation [11,12] and caused a drastic loss of ecosystem services for millions of people [13][14][15]. Thus, the conservation and recovery of ecosystem services in tropical forests are strategies for guaranteeing sustainability at a global level. To reverse the effects of deforestation, tropical areas have been experiencing expanding reforestation efforts in recent years [10,16,17]. Global and large-scale initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge [18] and Initiative 20x20 [19] have set audacious targets for the restoration of degraded ecosystems (350 million hectares worldwide by 2030 and 20 million hectares in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2020, respectively), reflecting the possible increase in the area of restored ecosystems. Restoration actions focus on the recovery of the structure, function and biodiversity of degraded ecosystems [20][21][22]. Recently, restoration projects have systematically focused on the recovery of ecosystem services [23][24][25], attracting financial support [26,27]. Therefore, restoration better represents the goals for biodiversity conservation and maintenance of the ecosystem services necessary for human welfare [23,24]. Many studies have demonstrated that ecological restoration provides critical ecosystem services [25,28]. For example, ecological restoration improves soil conditions by retaining and delivering nutrients to plants, affecting nutrient and biogeochemical cycles [29][30][31][32]. Additionally, the incorporation of biomass by active or passive restoration potentially increases carbon sequestration [16,33], affecting the global carbon cycle.",

Although one-off studies point to the importance of restoration to recover ES in tropical forests, the impacts of these effects on a broad scale are scarcely known. Restoration can be performed with different strategies (natural regeneration, nucleation, reforestation with native, reforestation with exotic, agroforestry), and the choice of strategy is based on a set of local features, including ecological (ecosystem resilience, land use, landscape descriptors), social (possibility of providing income for local communities) and economic (management costs) features [20,[35][36][37][38]. Little is known about how the choice of the restoration strategy potentially affects the effectiveness in recovering ecosystem services [39]. Ecological restoration can also be affected by the type of disturbance in the target area: its success will depend on the intensity, extent, severity and duration of land use [37,40,41]. In this context, different types of disturbances, such as human impacts (logging, agriculture, pasture) and natural disturbance (tree-falls, hurricanes, landslides), affect many site-specific factors that influence the recovery rate of ecosystem services [36,42]. Moreover, the rates of recovery of ecosystem services can be influenced by the time since abandonment [25] and the landscape context [43]. In each successional stage, biotic factors (species composition) and abiotic factors (soil nutrients) could change and generate particular services [37]. Many studies analyze the change in these factors in chronosequences [44][45][46][47], but evaluating the influence of time on the recovery of each type of ecosystem service from its respective restoration strategy is also necessary. Thus, to what extent the restoration strategy choice and the type of degradation affect the restoration of ecosystem services is crucial for the conservation and management of tropical forests. Some previous meta-analysis studies in tropical forests approached specifically the drivers of the success of restoration [43], the effects of restoration strategies [48], and the changes in specific ES [34,49]. However, it is not still clear how the restoration in areas with different degradation history affect multiple ES along the time.",

The reference ecosystem still has a very large proportion of ES when compared to restored areas, suggesting that preserving the remaining areas of tropical forests is more conservative in maintaining the forest functionality and services [58,59].

This region receives increasing attention from carbon market entrepreneurs, attracted in part by the scientific evidence that bottomland forests have high capacity to sequester carbon in tree biomass (Brinson 1990). Although LMV soils in the vernacular are synonymous with high productivity, there is a scarcity of published growth and yield studies with which to substantiate this for bottomland hardwood afforestation in the LMV, all the more notable given the recent history and magnitude of the practice in the region (Stanturf et al. 2001, Gardiner and Oliver 2005, King et al. 2007). Only recently has an effort been made to specifically validate the widely used Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) growth model for use in the LMV (Hohl et al. unpublished). Consequently, there is considerable disparity in carbon sequestration estimates for afforestation of bottomland hardwoods (unpublished sources, Birdsey 1996, Smith et al. 2006). To address this need, the revisions to the U.S. Department of Energy 1605(b) voluntary greenhouse gas reporting guidelines assembled regional volume and carbon yield tables for a range of forest types and practices in the U.S. (Smith et al. 2006).

Expressed as a mean annual increment calculated at year 50 of 4.43 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent acre 21 year 21 , this represents nominal value generated of $27 acre 21 year 21 . Alone, this amount is insufficient to offset current opportunity costs on private lands related to agricultural rental rates, which averaged $72-93 acre 21 year 21 in the LMV region of Mississippi in 2007/2008 (Martin 2008). Hence to date, afforestation projects funded solely by carbon finance have mainly occurred on state and federal lands where projects do not compete with agriculture. Nevertheless, the value of carbon as a newly marketable ecosystem service can make an important contribution to overall costs of bottomland hardwood afforestation. As a decision support tool, it is important that the modeled estimate be applied and expressed at the same scale as it was derived, namely as the predicted total live tree biomass carbon for the average bottomland hardwood stand from across a range of conditions (soil type, species composition, planting density) and from throughout the LMV region.

In the 0-to 5-cm soil depth, soil organic C (SOC) was higher in RMSs under pasture by 99% and under hay by 52% over that under forest. Similarly, total nitrogen (TN) was higher in RMSs under pasture by 98% and under hay by 43% over that under forest.

Th e SOC pools in the 0-to 30-cm depth decreased in the order of RMSs under hay = RMSs under pasture > RMSs under forest = undisturbed forest = agriculture land use. Nitrogen pools followed a similar trend. Hay land use has a better potential for improving soil quality in RMSs by enhancing chemical properties and SOC and TN pools than forest or pasture land uses.",

Thus, age chronosequence sites, ranging from b 1 to 25 years of reclamation, under forest and pasture land use, were identified to determine ecosystem C and N pools. Ecosystem C and N pools and selected soil properties were measured for 42 reclaimed sites across northeast Ohio. Soil organic C (SOC) was estimated by determining coal C and inorganic C, and subtracting these from the total soil C. Of the total soil C in reclaimed soil, coal C ranged from 0.2 to 15%, and inorganic C from b1 to 42%, depending on soil depth and land use. The C sequestered in the minesoil ecosystem followed a polynomial function, with the highest rate of sequestration of 6.59 Mg ha -1 after 14 years of reclamation in the forest and 1.61 Mg ha -1 after 6 years under pasture. After 25-year of reclamation, C sequestration was 107 Mg ha -1 under forest ecosystem and 21 Mg ha -1 under pasture. In the forest ecosystem, a major portion of ecosystem C consisted of soil C (94%) during the initial period (b 1 year) and biomass C (66%) during the later period (N 14 year). In the pasture ecosystem, soil C contributed a major portion of ecosystem C throughout the reclamation period: 95% for b 1 year and 89% for N 25 years of reclamation. However, soil N contributed a significant portion of ecosystem N in both the forest and pasture ecosystems. Ecosystem C and N pools and bulk densities were strongly related with reclamation age for both forest and pasture. The rates of ecosystem C and N sequestration peaked at about 10 to 15 years of reclamation. After 10 to 15 years of reclamation, the rate of sequestration decreased as reclamation age increased.",

Land area disturbed by human activities continues to increase through deforestation, conversion to agricultural land use, urbanization, and exploitation of mineral resources. Coal is an important resource for industrial use (Freme, 2007), and its mining causes drastic changes in the soil profile and loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient pools (Indorante et al., 1981). However, with the choice of proper reclamation techniques and post-reclamation management practices, drastically disturbed mined soils can be restored. Depletion of SOC and nitrogen (N) pools through drastic disturbance are among serious constraints to the establishment of vegetation in reclaimed mine soils (Haering et al., 1993a,b). Thus, long-term reclamation success depends on the restoration of ecosystem functions (Ibarra et al., 2005). Soil profile development in reclaimed soil, a significant factor for the restoration of ecosystem functions, depends on biomass productivity, root development, humification of biomass, and changes in minesoil properties resulting from weathering (Amichev et al., 2004;Haering et al., 1993a,b). Accumulation of SOC in the surface layer of reclaimed soil is vital for soil profile development and restoration of ecosystem functions (Jochimsen, 1996;Bradshaw, 1997). The SOC accumulation in reclaimed soil improves physical, chemical, and biological properties by reducing bulk density and increasing water holding capacity, porosity, and nutrient availability such as N, P, and S (Bhogal et al., 2009;Shrestha et al., 2009). Moreover, biomass-C is an energy source for soil biota, and leads to formation of humus upon decomposition and mineralization of plant residues and recycling of nutrients within the restored mined ecosystems (Allison, 1973). In addition, climate, soil properties, length of time since reclamation, post-reclamation land use, and management play a major role in soil profile development of reclaimed soils (Merrill et al., 1998).",

Quantifying the temporal dynamics of C and N pools in a terrestrial ecosystem is critical to the understanding of regional patterns of C and N budgets. The terrestrial C and N budgets are affected by complex interactions among plant productivity, decomposition, climate, soil properties, and human intervention. Long-term studies are essential to comprehensively understand the magnitude of ecosystem C and N fluxes and pools. Age chronosequence approach is important, in absence of systematic long-term study, to understand temporal changes in ecosystem C and N pools in reclaimed soils (Knops and Tilman, 2000), especially because initial soil properties are often unknown. Several age chronosequence studies (Li and Daniels, 1994;Rumpel et al., 1999;Akala and Lal, 2000;Schwenke et al., 2000;Gast et al., 2001;Maharaj et al., 2007) have reported accumulation of C and N pools over time in reclaimed soils. However, ecosystem processes and the long-term changes in C and N in reclaimed soil land uses are poorly understood (Amichev et al., 2008). Thus, there exists a lack of systematic studies in understanding the dynamics of key processes at the ecosystem level which affect rate of increase of C and N pools following reclamation, and sustainability of reclaimed ecosystems. Age chronosequence provides an opportunity to understand the changes in soil physical and chemical processes with an ecosystem. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: (1) study the changes in ecosystem C and N pools in 25-year old chronosequences comprising forest and pasture land uses, and (2) develop empirical relationships between ecosystem C and N pools and selected soil properties with the duration of reclamation age.",

The facilitation between different species may induce overyielding. Meanwhile, the species-specific fine root foraging strategies and tradeoffs would determine the structure and dynamics of plant communities. Here the aim was to investigate the admixing effects of fine-root biomass, vertical distribution and morphology in Pinus massoniana-Cinnamomum camphora mixed plantations and corresponding monocultures at 10-, 24-and 45-year old stands.\nResults:The fine root biomass in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed forest exerted a certain degree of overyielding effect. These positive admixing effects, however, did not enhance with forest stand development. The overall relative yield total ranged from 1.83 and 1.51 to 1.33 in 10-, 24-and 45-year-old stand, respectively. The overyielding was mainly attributed to the over-performance of late successional species, Cinnamomum, in mixed stands. The vertical fine root biomass distribution model showed fine roots of pioneer species, Pinus, shifted to the superficial layer when mixed with Cinnamomum. Furthermore, the specific root length (SRL) of Pinus was significantly higher in Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed stands than that in monocultures, and the magnitude of differences increased over time. However, the vertical fine-root distribution and SRL for Cinnamomum did not show significant differences between monoculture and mixtures.\nConclusions:Our results indicated that the magnitude of fine root overyielding in mixed forests showed a high degree of consistency with the total amount of fine root biomass itself, suggesting the overyielding effects in mixed forests were correlated with the degree of belowground interaction and competition degree involved. The late successional species, Cinnamomum, invested more carbon to belowground by increasing the fine root biomass in mixtures. While the pioneer species, Pinus, adapted to the presence of the species Cinnamomum by modification of vertical distribution and root morphological plasticity in the mixtures.",

The high tree density may have accounted for the higher root biomass, which is in agreement with a previous report described for 13-yearold postfire lodgepole pine forests, where the fine root biomass increased with tree density [30]. In contrast to previously published studies that maximum fine root biomass is reached at the canopy closure stage of stand development [2,31,32], we found early stand developmental stage with high root biomass. The previous study showed that fine root biomass reached a maximum at an approximate age of 25 years, and then declined to a steady-state, as forests approached maturity. In our study sites, the canopy was already closed, even in the 10-yearold stand due to high planting density. Besides stand ages, the fine root biomass dynamics might also relate to the other stand characteristics, such as tree density, stand structure, basal area and aboveground biomass, etc. [33][34][35]. When compared with three types of plantations, the fine root biomass was higher in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed stands than those in the pure Pinus and Cinnamomum stands in 30 cm soil depth in 10-and 24-year-old stands. Many previous studies reported the similar pattern that species-rich forests exhibited higher fine root biomass than species-poor stands [12,36]. Although the absolute fine root biomass in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed forests were not significantly higher than that the counterpart monocultures in 24-year-old, and even lower than that in monocultures in 45-year-old stands, the RYT was higher than one, suggesting overyielding when comparing the adjusted fine root biomass per basal area in mixed forest with monocultures (Fig. 2b) [37].",

Likewise, fine root overyielding was reported in mixed forests of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium stands [38], as well as in European beech, sessile oak, Norway spruce and Douglas fir mixed stands at two-, three-, and four-species neighbourhoods in comparison to monocultures [17]. Here we primarily attempted to assess the variations of these admixing effects over time and expected that the admixing effect would be more pronounced over time, as the interactions between different species are assumed to be more intense over time. On the contrary, in this study, the magnitude of over-yielding in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed forests declined with stand development as shown in Figs. 1 and2. The significant differences between the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed forests and corresponding monocultures were only detected in 10-yearold forests. Besides, the direct evidence showed that relative yield total decreased from 1.83, and 1.51 to 1.33 in 10-, 24-and 45-year-old stand, respectively. This pattern is consistent the trend that the standing fine root biomass decreased with stand. Therefore, it is likely that the magnitude of fine root overyielding in mixed forests was correlated with fine root biomass and the belowground competitive degree involved instead. Fine-root turnover contributes substantially to soil organic matter inputs and productivity in forest ecosystems [39]. Thus, understanding the turnover of fineroots is important to unveil the belowground ecosystem Asterisks indicate significant differences between pure and mixed stands for the specific species within the same age stages (P < 0.05) function. The ratio of live to dead roots (i.e., B/N) could reflect the turnover characteristics of fine roots [36]. In our study, the B/N ratio of Pinus was higher than that of Cinnamomum. This could be attributed to a faster decomposition rate or a lower mortality of coniferous species Pinus compared to broadleaved species Cinnamomum [40].",
        "23cc1877-cdf2-41fd-b552-1f471e5da237": "Here we calculated the RYT for the component species in the mixtures to estimate the specific performance and dynamics of each species to the overyielding in the mixtures over time, and foraging strategies as well. In the mixtures, the RYT of late successional species, Cinnamomum, was higher than one for all the stand development stages and the differences were significant from one in 10-and 24-year-old stands. This pattern was supported by data on fine root biomass, which Cinnamomum accounted for 81.2, 81.3 and 53.2% in 10, 24 and 45-yearold Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed stands, respectively. Figure 1 suggesting Cinnamomum invested more carbon to belowground fine roots when co-occurring species presents. In contrast, the pioneer species, Pinus, showed significant higher RYT only in 10-year-old stand and then fluctuated from one thereafter. In our study, we compared the vertical distribution of fine root biomass with the exponential model of Gale and Grigal [29] and found very similar patterns for the overall distribution in pure stands along chronosequence. Two species showed the exponential indicator (\u03b2 values) increased with stand development. The \u03b2 value indicated that there was clear spatial separation of the fine root systems of the Pinus within 30 cm soil profile. The Pinus roots occupied the deeper soil layers in the pure stand whereas it shifted to the superficial layers when mixed with Cinnamomum. Many previous researches revealed significant effect of mixed stand on fine root distributions. Bolte and Villanueva [14] suggested that fine root of Picea abies distributed deeper in mixed stands than pure stands. Moreover, in mixed stand of Fagus sylvatica and Quercus Petraea, fine roots of F. sylvatica grew deeper than fine roots of Q. petraea [41]. The presence of Cinnamomum in the mixed stands could have pushed the fine root system of Pinus towards the soil surface where the water and nutrient were more enriched.",
        "3fbe638e-1214-4860-a55d-94d4cb9a290f": "In mixed stand fine roots tend to proliferate and compete with neighbors for nutrients and water by developing a more flexible fine root system when there is more intense belowground competition [42,43]. On the other hand, the shallower root allocation could be more susceptible to the drought. For Cinnamomum, the fine root distribution model indicated that there was no obvious spatial separation of the fine root systems within 30 cm soil profile. Therefore, different tree species may have different strategies for the presence of neighbor species in terms of vertical niche separation. The specific root length (SRL) was used as indicator for nutrient uptake efficiency and responses to environmental changes or competition [44]. SRL can reflect the root growth strategies on the efficiency of consumption photosynthetic primary product, high SRL indicate high efficiency of using photosynthetic primary product of plant root systems [45]. Our studies showed that SRL of Pinus decreased slightly with increase forest age in monocultures, but increased with stand age in mixtures. In 45-year-old stand, the SRL of Pinus in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed stand was up to two-fold higher than that in monocultures, suggesting Pinus exploited water and nutrient resources more efficiently with given carbon investment when growing admixed with Cinnamomum. It is likely that pioneer species, Pinus, was stressed by the competition from the later successional species, Cinnamomum. To what extent the pioneer species can adjust the root morphology to the neighbour species competition could be a big issue. The results were consistent with previous study showing that the specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) for beech were higher in beech-spruce mixtures than that in monocultures [14]. For Cinnamomum, in contrast, fine root morphology was rather similar in pure and mixed stands.",

Furthermore, fine-root morphological traits may vary as a consequence of interactions with soil biota, such as ectomycorrhizal fungi, which may confound root plasticity responses to resource availability [47]. This is especially true for pine species which are obligatedly ectomycorrhizal. Unfortunately, we have no ectomycorrhizal data to examine whether this ectomycorrhizal infection effect is mirrored morphological plasticity or otherwise, which merits further investigations.",

Natural vegetation at different altitudes has different soil physical environments and vegetation compositions, which brings about a significant impact on the storage and dynamics of soil organic C [31,53,64]. However, it is still unclear how soil C stock changes with altitude, because both vegetation types and soil physicochemical conditions can affect soil organic C stocks at different altitudes [53]. Generally, there are more C inputs to soil, but higher soil moisture and temperatures at lower altitudes compared to higher altitudes [17,53]. Investigating how altitude affects soil organic C stocks is important for C evaluation in natural vegetation. However, natural vegetation was largely destroyed and replaced by tree plantations, especially in (sub-)tropical regions, including China and Australia [2]. The area of tree plantations is the largest in China, as an important strategy for C sequestration and forest restoration [2]. Afforestation was found to increase, decrease, or had no significant impact on soil C accumulation by site-specific studies [14,32,49,63,35,20]. Multiple factors can account for those inconsistent results, including differences in climate, soil types, tree species, forest age and nutrient management [29,30,33,42]. Plantations with different tree species have different capacities of C sequestraton [33,42,46,49,56]. For example, soil C storage was found to be greater under plantations with nitrogen-fixing trees than with Eucalyptus species [49]. Plantations with broadleaf species generally restored higher soil C than coniferous species [29,22,24]. Plantations with pure species and mixed species also have different capacities of C sequestration [15,22,24]. In addition, forest age is another responsible factor affecting the capacity of C sequestration, because it needs a long term for plantations to restore C in soils.",

Soil C concentrations were found to increase until the plantation was established by in a global meta-analysis of reforestation [42]. Although several studies of data synthesis evaluated the capacity of soil C sequestration under plantations, data in subtropical regions are still lacking. The different capacities of soil C sequestration under plantations differed among different tree species can be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, the quantity and quality of plant C inputs, including above-and below-ground C inputs, with different species are different [57], which can affect soil C accumulation and turnover by influencing soil aggregate formation and their interactions with soil microbial decomposers [33,18,11,21,28]. In addition, soil physicochemical environments can be changed by different tree species, which have different growth rates and biomass production [43,44,60]), and can pose different effects on soil properties, such as soil pH [5,48,50]. Soil pH is an important factor affecting the community and activity of soil microorganisms, and thus impact the turnover of soil organic matter [1,27,37]. Soil nutrient status can also be altered by different tree species [12]. As forest development, large quantities of soil nutrients can be absorbed by stand biomass and only a few returns to the soils, which probably leads to nutrient limitation in soils [4]. Accordingly, the effects of plantation on soil C accumulation is site-specific. More studies are needed to investigate site-specific mechanisms underlying soil C sequestration by plantations with different tree species. At present, few studies have simultaneously compared soil organic C stocks among different natural vegetation along altitudinal gradients, between natural vegetation and plantations, and among plantations with different tree species in subtropical regions.

Thirteen tree species (nine native and four nonnative species) were planted as part of the reforestation effort in the mid to late 1930s. In 1992, there were 75 tree species (\u03fe9.1 cm dbh) in the forest. Overall, planted species accounted for 40% of the importance value of the forest; planted nonnative species contributed only 5% of the importance value.

As economic development proceeds in tropical countries, land use practices change, and degraded land is abandoned. Some of this land is reforested either through natural succession or through assisted succession and plantation establishment. The area of secondary forest and plantations in the tropics now exceeds the area of mature forest (Lugo andBrown 1992, FAO 1993).

Winjum et al. (1992) estimated that 52-104 Pg of C could be sequestered over 50 years through reforestation and afforestation globally, with \u03f370% occurring in tropical latitudes. Significant amounts of C can accumulate in plants and soils within the first 20 years of forest regrowth (Brown andLugo 1992, Silver et al. 2000a), and aboveground C pools can exceed 100 Mg/ha in humid secondary forests after just 50 years (Lugo and Brown 1992).",

Tropical pastures often store more soil C than mature tropical forests (Detwiler 1986, Neill et al. 1996), and thus tropical reforestation can result in a decrease in soil C pools. Significant losses of residual soil C have recently been reported during early secondary succession (Rhoades et al. 2000) and from young plantations (Bashkin and Little and Wadsworth (1989) and Molina and Aleman \u02dcy (1997). Binkley 1998, Binkley andResh 1999). The degree to which these short-term patterns persist over long time periods is unknown. The eventual, long-term effects of reforestation on soil C pools represent an important missing piece of information for evaluating reforestation as a C offset option. The plant community composition and structure of reforested ecosystems often differs from mature forest ecosystems (Lugo 1992). Reforested ecosystems often consist of a mix of planted and naturally regenerated species. Both native and nonnative species are planted for reforestation; nonnative species are often chosen for reforestation when native species are difficult to establish (Evans 1992). The use of nonnative species in reforestation has raised concerns about the long-term effects of nonnatives on the establishment and viability of native species (Lamb 1998). Although increased biodiversity is often an added benefit of reforestation in the tropics, initial planting tends to result in lower biodiversity, higher dominance, and different species composition than natural secondary forests (Lugo 1992). The presence of planted native and nonnative species is likely to affect C dynamics. Species composition and dominance impact the amount and mean residence time of C in the ecosystem through effects on plant growth rates, C allocation patterns, and C quality (Hobbie 1992, Lugo 1992).",

Total net production ranged from 3.5 (for Shorea robusta) to 32.0 t ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (for Dendrocalamus strictus), respectively. Microbial biomass in the redeveloping soil was lower compared to that in natural forest soil but immobilization of soil C in microbial biomass was greater in the mine spoil than in the natural forest. The study indicated that net primary production of the plantations was a function of the amount of foliage, soil C was a function of the amount of litter fall and biomass C was a function of soil C. Plantation of trees significantly accelerated the soil redevelopment process on the mine spoil.",

Expansion of industrialization needs massive energy generation for which huge quantity of coal is extracted through mining, causing extensive landscape destruction. In India, total annual coal production estimated during 1994-1995 was 325 million tonnes and this was expected to increase to 417 million tonnes by 1999-2000, of which the contribution of opencast mining would be about 252 million tonnes (Banerjee 1990). Opencast coal mining removes surface earth, piling it over unmined land and forming chains of external dumps i.e. mine spoil or overburden. Mine spoils possess very rigorous conditions for both plant and microbial growth because of low organic matter contents, and other unfavourable physico-chemical characteristics (Jha and Singh 1993;Singh et al. 1995Singh et al. , 2002Singh et al. , 1996;;Singh and Singh 1999). Restoration of such degraded lands is a challenging ecological problem. Natural recovery in mine spoils is a slow process (Jha and Singh 1991). For example, Srivastava et al. (1989) estimated that it may take about 200 yrs of natural succession on a mine spoil for the total nitrogen pool to recover to the level of native forest soil. A successful restoration programme attempts to accelerate the natural recovery processes to restore the soil fertility and to enhance the biological diversity (Dobson et al. 1997;Singh and Singh 2001). The first step in any restoration programme, of course, is to protect the disturbed habitat and communities from being further wasted (Singh and Jha 1993). Then follow attempts to accelerate the revegetation process for increasing biodiversity and stabilizing nutrient cycling (Singh et al. 1995).",

A series of experiments was performed in the Singrauli coalfield of India with the objectives: (a) to screen indigenous tree species suitable for revegetation by pot culture experiments, (b) to evaluate the direct seeding technique for mine spoil revegetation on flat and sloping surfaces, (c) to evaluate the above-and belowground biomass production of selected species planted on mine spoil; and (d) to assess the effect of plantations on physico-chemical properties of mine spoil and soil redevelopment.

However, all of them can potentially be grown on mine spoil and the growth of a majority of them can be improved by amending the mine spoil with NPK. Singh et al. (2000) and Singh and Singh (2001) have documented the effect of NPK fertilization on 10 native tree species planted on mine spoil. All the 10 tropical tree species tested by them responded to NPK fertilization, and the impact of fertilization was comparatively more on nonleguminous tree species than on the leguminous tree species. A greater growth in fertilized plots was also accompanied by greater foliar N and P concentrations in all species. Singh and Singh (2001) obtained a positive relationship between growth rates (height, diameter and volume increments) and foliar N and P concentrations.

Expansion of industrialization for human development needs massive energy generation, for which huge quantity of coal is extracted through mining, causing extensive landscape destruction (Bradshaw 2000;Singh et al. 2006a). Mine spoils originated from opencast mining process, which removes surface earth, peeling it over un-mined land and forming chains of external dumps, recalled as overburden or mine spoil. In general, these spoils are not suitable for both plant and microbial growth because of low organic matter, and other unfavorable physico-chemical characteristics, especially insufficient amount of essential nutrients (N and P) (Singh et al. 1995;Singh et al. 1999;Singh et al. 2004a, b). Due to this situation, recovery of such degraded ecosystems into original state needs a carefully scientific approach to manage the problem. The recovery by natural succession is a very slow process; it depends on time and space and is influenced by geographical and climatic factors and ecological condition of the problem site. However, it can be accelerated by planting some desirable species that can develop a nutrient circuit in the soil for self-sustaining community through colonization of native plants in the long term and avoiding soil erosion by plant cover in short term (Singh et al. 1995;Yusuf et al. 2004). According to Singh & Singh (1999), a desired species for planting on mine spoils should possess the abilities: (i) to grow on poor and dry soils, (ii) to develop the vegetation cover in short time and to accumulate biomass rapidly, (iii) to bind soil for arresting soil erosion and checking nutrient loss, and (iv) to improve the soil organic matter status and soil microbial biomass, thereby enhancing the supply of plant available nutrients.

Restoration success depends on the augmentation of biological activity of the surface soil horizons in the long term; thus, the primary approach to revegetation is to raise the levels of essential nutrients (C, N and P) in the soil and to control soil erosion by plant cover. N and P are two major limiting nutrients in various newly established coal sites (Bradshaw 2000;Singh et al. 2004a, b), which limit the establishment and proper growth of vegetation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of planting species on essential nutrients of coal mine spoil in redeveloping stage.",

There was a general improvement in soil properties due to establishment of plantations. Highest soil organic C values were found in A. lebbeck plantations and lowest in T. grandis plantations. Both A. lebbeck and A. procera substantially increased levels of nitrogen in soil. However, A. procera, with slow decomposing litter, was not as effective in raising N levels in the soil as A. lebbeck, indicating that all N fixers may not be equally efficient in raising soil N levels. Soil microbial biomass and N mineralization rates were always higher in plantations of N-fixer species.

Mine spoils refer to any overburden material not specifically salvaged in the pre-mining phase (Jha and Singh, 1992). Mine spoils are nutritionally impoverished habitats characterized by low N mineralization rates, low phosphate availability, low soil organic matter, poor soil structure, compacted subsoil, poor drainage, low water holding capacity (WHC) (King, 1988) and lack of microbial activity (Gonzalez-Sangregorio et al., 1991). Restoration of a stable and productive soil following destruction by mining operations requires the establishment of a self-sustaining soil/plant system in which nutrient release rates are adequate for plant growth (Stroo and Jencks, 1982). A satisfactory rehabilitation of a mined landscape demands a permanent vegetation cover that will prevent soil erosion, permitting in the long-term sustainable soil development (Seaker and Sopper, 1984). Tree plantations are recognized for their ability to restore soil fertility and for amelioration of microclimatic conditions (Singh et al., 2002). The ecological basis for the use of plantations for rehabilitation of damaged tropical lands has been described by Lugo (1992), Lugo et al. (1993), andParrotta (1992). However, each plant species has its own growth characteristics that determine its value in stabilizing and enriching soil. Grasses and legumes are the most effective plant materials for controlling erosion in Forest Ecology and Management 187 (2004) [49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] early stages of reclamation. Tree and shrubs have an advantage of providing a permanent cover on disturbed areas with little or no additional after-care or maintenance. Because of deep roots, trees are able to loosen compacted soil to greater depths than grasses. Tree plantations are nutrient and carbon sinks, a condition that leads to the re-establishment of soil fertility and forest conditions within which native species can prosper (Lugo, 1992).",
        "7a918a97-62cb-48de-8703-41e1d648dc64": "Trees can improve soils through numerous processes including maintenance or increase of soil organic matter, biological nitrogen fixation, uptake of nutrients from below the reach of roots of understorey herbaceous vegetation, increased water infiltration and storage, reduced loss of nutrients by erosion and leaching, improved soil physical properties, reduced soil acidity and improved soil biological activity (Young, 1997). Given time, new self-sustaining topsoils are created by trees (Filcheva et al., 2000). However, impacts of trees on soil fertility depend on their nutrient cycling characteristics such as litter chemistry and decomposition (Montagnini et al., 1995). Some plantation species exhibit high nutrient use efficiency and may be more effective nutrient sinks than other species (Lugo, 1992). In temperate environments, slower growing broad-leaved native trees are regarded more pleasant but less efficient for timber production (Filcheva et al., 2000). The study of soil characteristics has been emphasized in restoration studies because soil is one of the primary agents in determining vegetation development. Quantitative, directional change in soil properties over time following disturbance indicates soil development route (Aarde et al., 1998). Mine spoils are characterized by the loss of soil both in the pedological and the biological sense. This study provides an opportunity to understand the impact of young high-density plantations of two native leguminous (Albizia procera and A. lebbeck and one non-leguminous timber tree (Tectona grandis) species on soil redevelopment process during the early phase of mine spoil restoration.",

Development of forests and cropping system, for the restoration of such degraded sodic lands, are important ecological methods in northern India, contributing globally for the mitigation of adverse effect of climate change (Pandey et al., 2011;Singh et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2011). The sodic soils are widely distributed (about 1.35 million hectare) in this region (Sharma et al., 2004). These soils are degraded in terms of structural, nutritional, chemical, hydrological and microbial activities (Singh et al., 2000). Physically sodic soils are compact with high clay levels, poor particle behaviour (swelling and dispersion), extremely low hydraulic conductivity and poor aggregate stability (Qadir et al., 2007;Sahin et al., 2011). It is well explored that pH of sodic soils ranges from about 8 to >10, with a high level of exchangeable sodium percent (ESP 25-85%) and low level of exchangeable calcium (Ca ++ ) (due to low soluble CaCO 3 ), with a poor organic carbon and nitrogen content (Qadir et al., 2007;Shukla et al., 2011).

Low fertility of sodic soils has been attributed to extremely less availability of organic matter. The enhancement of soil organic matter in these soils is not only of vital importance to biological processes and soil productivity even it plays an important role in sodicity diminution (Singh, 1996). The reclamation efforts made so far using chemical amendments, organic mulching with green manuring, industrial effluents and organic amendments were deemed too costly (Gupta and Abrol, 2000;Clark et al., 2007;Tejada et al., 2006;Yuan et al., 2007;Gill et al., 2008Gill et al., , 2009)). However, attempts made to reclaim these soils through afforestation have indicated sustainable improvement in soil fertility, depending upon tree species, community composition, age and productivity of the forest or tree plantations (Bhojvaid and Timmer, 1998;Mishra et al., 2002Mishra et al., , 2003;;Singh et al., 2004;Tripathi and Singh, 2005;Mishra and Sharma, 2010).

The primary objective of the study, restoration of degraded sodic land, was to promote fast plant establishment on abandoned land in order to build up soil fertility. The plantation with multiple tree species provides huge litter (organic matter), permanent shade with different light intensities, development of deep and profuse root network and wet and dry cycles were the strategies that have proved afforestation to be ecologically efficient in achieving the objective. A secondary but equally important objective in restoration of degraded sodic land was to stimulate the soil resilience by the continuous cropping without any chemical amendment. In addition, we also observed the seasonal variations in soil properties of degraded and rehabilitated lands.

We compared an agricultural field (AF), plantations of Alnus subcordata (AS), Acer velutinum (AV), Quercus castaneifolia (QC) and Cupressus sempervirens (CS), and a natural forest (NF). Soil samples were collected at three different depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm). Results showed that different land covers significantly affected soil characteristics, and SOC increased by 25% and 1.11% after the conversion of NF to CS and AS plantations respectively, and decreased by 4%, 12.11% and 53% when NF was converted to QC, AV and AF respectively. In all treatments, MBC and MR were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the 0-20 cm depth, and MR was also correlated positively with MBC and SOC.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC, 2007), the current GHG concentrations are 30% higher than the pre-industrial level. The increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the related rising global mean temperatures are threatening the earth's climate and natural habitats (Lal, 2003;IPCC, 2014). Terrestrial ecosystems play a major role as global reservoirs of soil carbon (C) (Piao et al., 2009), and soils hold two thirds of the Earth's C (Stockmann et al., 2013). The global C cycle is affected by the interactions among SOC, biosphere and atmosphere (Kutsch et al., 2010), and topsoils (0-30 cm depth), contain nearly half of soil organic carbon (SOC) and up to three times the C stored aboveground in vegetation. Because of land-management and climatic change, which is considered a main threat to climate (Powlson et al., 2011) topsoils are vulnerable to loss SOC as CO 2 emissions. The spatial distribution of SOC is mainly regulated by environmental factors and anthropogenic activity (Fern\u00e1ndez-Romero et al., 2014;Sattler et al., 2014); however, agricultural management can improve C storage either by increasing C inputs through higher crop yields or slowing its release to the atmosphere (Smith et al., 2008). Land-use change (especially deforestation) has been historically responsible for a large part of the cumulative human-induced GHG emissions (IPCC, 2007), thus affecting SOC storage that is regulated by the microbial transformations of C inputs from residues (Cramer et al., 2001;Berthelot et al., 2002;Lal, 2005;Schulp et al., 2008;Tate III, 1987).",

Microbial activity regulates the decomposition of plant residues (Thoms and Gleixner, 2013), and different forest plantations provide different substrates available for microbial growth, which in turn can provide a different functioning of soil microbes (Jagadamma et al., 2014). Also, the environmental conditions under the forest canopy can affect soil respiration and microbial biomass. In this regards roots have important role and greater root system will increase subsoil C inputs and interactions with soil biota and as a result higher root turnover and rates of exudation leading to accelerated microbial activity (Williams et al., 2000;Jones and Donnelly, 2004). The type of vegetation and land management have a significant importance on ecosystem sustainability (Carter, 2002;Dube et al., 2009), and are closely linked to SOC and soil microbial biomass and respiration (Guo and Gifford, 2002;Ross et al., 2002;Six et al., 2002;Lal, 2004;Huygens et al., 2005;Dube et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2016;Kooch et al., 2017).

Conversion of cropland to forest could lead to significantly greater SOC accumulation than would the conversion of cropland to grassland. Conversion from cropland to woodland could lead to greater SOC accumulation than would the conversion to either shrubland or orchard. Our results suggest that the GGP implementation caused SOC to accumulate and that there remains a large potential for further accumulation of carbon in the soil, which will help to mitigate climate change in the near future.\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) accounts for more than half of the carbon storage in the soil carbon pool of the terrestrial ecosystem and is an important contributor to the variation of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. The conversion of natural vegetation to cropland during the past two centuries is thought to have contributed greatly to increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations 1-3 , and afforestation in cropland and wasteland may lead to the accumulation of carbon.

Guo and Gifford 2 reported that SOC stocks significantly increased by 18% and 19% after the conversion of cropland to plantation and pasture, respectively. Don et al. 17  land was afforested and by 26% after cropland conversion into grassland. For the GGP in China, our study showed a higher rate of increase (55.6% and 36.9% in the top 20 cm of soil for CCF and CCG, respectively) than the rate reported by Guo and Gifford 2 , indicating that the GGP in China has caused strong SOC accumulation. Moreover, the SOC accumulation rates were significantly higher under CCF than under CCG at depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm (P , 0.05), which implies that CCF is a more efficient way to accumulate carbon in soil than is CCG. This may occur because forest soils receive more carbon input from aboveground litter and belowground roots but experience less carbon output due to erosion than does grassland 10 . Effects of the plantation type on the SOC. The plantation type created after afforestation can also greatly affect SOC accumulation by affecting carbon inputs such as litter and affecting carbon loss by soil respiration and leaching 23,24 . For example, previous studies found that pine plantations significantly decreased the soil carbon stocks, whereas the planting of broadleaf trees had little effect on soil carbon, most likely because pine roots reduced the carbon input into the soil 2,25 .",
        "0ac06ea2-fb80-4ab3-bb11-537bd8715097": "Shi et al. 26 found that trees had a greater capacity than shrubs to increase the SOC stock in the top 20 cm of soil in afforested croplands, whereas this capacity was reversed in the deep soil layer (below 20 cm). The authors speculated that this trend occurred because 90% of the shrubs used in cropland restoration are N-fixing species, which facilitate carbon accumulation in agricultural soil. Such shrubs allocate more of their photosynthetic production into the deep soil layer compared to trees. In the current meta-analysis, the plantation type was shown to significantly affect the SOC accumulation in the top 20 cm of soil (P , 0.05). The highest response ratio was observed for afforestation in woodland, and the lowest response ratio was observed in orchards. This may be due in part to the extensive organic matter input into the soil from the large above-ground biomass in woodland. In orchards, frequent human disturbances such as fertilization and fruit picking may affect the organic matter input. Our results imply that the conversion from cropland to woodland could be considered a priority if afforestation conditions allow for this conversion type. Effects of the CCG restoration approach on SOC. Artificial grassland is associated with a low extent of SOC accumulation and high costs. Thus, we suggest that a natural restoration approach should be given priority in CCG from the perspective of enhancing soil carbon accumulation. SOC variation with soil depth. The SOC of topsoil is more susceptible to land use changes and other perturbations as compared to the deep soil 27 . Therefore, the SOC accumulation varies with the soil depth after afforestation 13,17 . This variation has received little attention in previous reviews 12,16,26 . Our analysis revealed that the response ratios of SOC under both CCF and CCG were significantly higher in the top 20 cm of soil than at soil depths of 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm. Guo and Gifford 2 also found that carbon accumulation declined with soil depth after the conversion of cropland to pasture.",
        "560efade-cce5-4dcd-8d00-a22832e617c1": "Our findings indicate that carbon accumulation is more responsive to the GGP in the top soil layer than in the deeper soil layers (below 20 cm). Determinants of SOC variation. SOC variation results from an imbalance between carbon input and output. After conversion from cropland to plantation or grassland, the aboveground biomass gradually becomes large, resulting in a high input of organic matter such as litter and below-ground biomass into the soil. This causes the soil temperature to decrease and creates high waterholding capacity and low SOC decomposition rates 16,26,28 . These changes facilitate SOC accumulation. In the early stage of afforestation, SOC accumulation may be not significant due to the low productivity of the new forest and strong carbon loss due to soil disturbance. Li et al. 13 reported that significant carbon stock increases occurred 30 yrs after afforestation. Shi et al. 26 also found that stand age was the main factor controlling SOC changes due to the afforestation of agricultural soil. Our results show that the GGP conversion period significantly affects the rate of soil carbon accumulation, especially for the top 20 cm of soil. SOC accumulation gradually increased with increasing conversion time, although the increase only became significant after 16-20 yrs of conversion (Figs. 3,4). The GGP has been ongoing for approximately 14 yrs  Bambooland ( 5) Orchard ( 12) Shrubland ( 23) Response ratio since being initiated in 1999. Based on these results, we argue that the SOC stock under the GGP will markedly increase over the next few decades and that the GGP has considerable potential to lead to additional carbon accumulation in soil in the future. The initial SOC content prior to afforestation also affects SOC accumulation. Shi et al. 26 reported that SOC change rates at depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm after the afforestation of cropland were significantly negatively correlated with the initial C content in each soil layer (P , 0.05), which is consistent with our findings (Table 2).",
        "60d4dc0e-2637-4cd6-bd23-c03bb6b69600": "This effect may be explained by the concept that a higher initial SOC can be more easily reduced by disturbances to the soil structure during forest planting 26 . Climate influences the productivity of an ecosystem and affects the decomposition of organic matter and C leaching. These processes in turn affect SOC accumulation 2,13 . Shi et al. 26 found that the relative SOC change in the topsoil (0-20 cm) after afforestation was sensitive to both MAP and MAT (P , 0.05). Laganie `re et al. 16 concluded that climatic factors had smaller effects on SOC accumulation than did other factors, such as the type of tree species that was planted. However, our analysis did not detect a significant relationship between the SOC response ratio to GGP and either the MAP or MAT, which is supported by the recent study of Deng et al. 29 . One possible reason for this observation is that most sites involved in the current study are located in arid and semiarid regions, especially the Loess Plateau of China, having a consistent climate with low MAP and MAT (Supplementary Table S1). The cold, dry climate may weaken the effects of climate factors on the SOC. Uncertainty. The GGP includes 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Our study involved 591 observations from 104 studies in 16 provinces covering the key areas of the GGP. The lack of observations from several provinces may weaken the certainty of the results to some extent. As the first meta-analysis of the Chinese GGP, our findings provide a new, comprehensive, and quantitative understanding of the potential role of the GGP in carbon sequestration for terrestrial ecosystems as well as climate change mitigation.",

In order to determine the characteristics of soil organic carbon and its components under different understory vegetation types in Subtropical Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation, Indocalamus tessellatus, Diplazium donianum and Oreocnide frutescenssp were taken as research objects. The mass fractions of total organic carbon, recalcitrant organic carbon, readily oxidizable organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon in each soil layer at 0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm were measured, and the change characteristics of soil organic carbon components were also studied and compared. The results showed that: (1) The mass fractions of total organic carbon, recalcitrant organic carbon, readily oxidizable organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon in the soils of the three understory vegetation types showed significant decreasing trends along the profile, while the mass fraction of dissolved organic carbon in 0-40 cm soil layer was significantly higher than those in 40-60 cm soil layer.

The soil layer of 0-20 cm under the Diplazium donianum community has a higher mass fraction and proportion of readily oxidizable organic carbon.

Generally, SOC is composed of different carbon components, which can be divided into three components: active, slow-acting and recalcitrant, according to their stability differences in soil [3]. Compared with slow-acting and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC), active organic carbon (AOC) components are easy to be decomposed and transformed and can quickly respond to external environmental changes, so it has become a hot spot in soil carbon pool research [4][5][6]. However, under the combined effect of external environmental factors, the various soil carbon pool components are able to transform into each and jointly regulate the stability of the forest soil carbon pool [7]. Therefore, clarifying the characteristics of the carbon pool of forest soil components plays an important role in deeply understanding the carbon cycle of forest ecosystems and can provide scientific data to support the realization of the goal of \"Carbon neutrality and Carbon emissions peak\" in China. As an important component of the plantation forest ecosystem, understory vegetation is an important factor affecting the distribution of SOC stocks and the distribution of its components, which can influence and regulate the soil carbon cycle through many aspects [8][9][10]. Relevant studies have shown that maintaining the richness and diversity of understory vegetation has a positive role in promoting the improvement of soil structure and nutrient increase [11,12], and the difference in understory vegetation species composition may cause changes in litter input and rhizosphere resources [13,14], changing the metabolic characteristics of soil microorganisms [15,16], which caused variation of community habitat and soil physical and chemical properties [11,17], and then regulate the formation and transformation of various carbon components and affect the stability of SOC pool.",

It is still unclear whether the distribution characteristics of each organic carbon component in the understory vegetation types and soil layers are consistent. Therefore, it is important to study the distribution differences of SOC components among understory vegetation types to clarify the internal mechanism of soil carbon pool change in plantation forests and to assess the carbon sequestration potential of plantation forest ecosystems accurately. Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. plantation forests are the main fast-growing timber forests in the southern region of China, accounting for about 25% of the plantation forest area in China [21], which plays an important role in regulating regional climate change and the carbon and nitrogen cycle. Because of the long-term planting of Cunninghamia lanceolata (C. lanceolata) monoculture and continuous planting, C. lanceolata plantations have shown a trend of declining soil nutrients [22] while retaining understory vegetation can improve stand yield and increase soil nutrient effectiveness [23], but the undergrowth species composition changes affect how SOC components needed further research. Therefore, three dominant understory vegetation of C. lanceolata plantation were selected in this paper: The soil covered by Oreocnide frutescens (Thunb.) Miq., Diplazium donianum (Mett.) Tard.

Branches and foliage formed 25\u00b135% of total tree biomass but they represented about 50% of total tree nutrients. H. alchorneoides, the four species mixture, and P. elegans had the greatest accumulations of total aboveground nutrients per hectare. The importance of the plantation \u00afoor as a nutrient compartment varied temporally. When forest \u00afoor litter biomass was at its peak, plantation \u00afoor litter N, Ca, and Mg were roughly equal to, or greater than stem nutrients for all species except for P. elegans. For P. elegans, the plantation \u00afoor consistently represented a very low proportion of total aboveground nutrients.

Fast-growing plantations often cause declines in soil fertility that may limit harvest to a few rotations (Perry and Maghembe, 1989;Montagnini and Porras, 1997). The harvest of forest products represents a nutrient `cost' to the site (Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994;Nykvist, 1997). Losses of nutrients during harvest may far exceed the rate of their replenishment by weathering of minerals in soils or by input via precipitation, especially when rotations are short (Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997). However, the amounts of nutrients in various tree tissues (foliage, branches, stems) differ substantially. Adjusting harvest regimes in consideration of the differing nutrient contents of these tissues can be an effective means of managing site nutrients (Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994;Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997;Nykvist, 1997). In many cases it is best not to remove some tissues, such as small branches and leaves, that can be more valuable as nutrient stores than as forest products. Managers can also conserve site nutrients by preferentially planting tree species that do not place high nutrient demands on the site (Bruijnzeel, 1989;Wang et al., 1991;Montagnini and Sancho, 1994). Opportunities for managing site nutrition through the planting of mixtures of species deserve consideration (Fo \u00c8lster and Khanna, 1997). Mixed plantations may be composed of fast-growing species with relatively high yields, while also containing slower growing species that have higher economic value (Montagnini et al., 1995), thus providing a diversi\u00aeed source of income.",

The temporary inclusion of pioneer trees as nurse crops on disturbed sites can facilitate the establishment of target tree species and may additionally benefit productivity and soil fertility. In this study we compared productivity and nutrient cycling between stands of oak target species (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) that were established with and without widely spaced Betula ssp. or Populus ssp. nurse crops. Simulation results for a full rotation of oaks (180 years) indicated that both types of forests, with and without nurse crops, have a comparable total productivity. However, stands with nurse crops supplied 59-96 Mg ha \u00c01 harvestable biomass after 20 years, whereas the first harvest of biomass from stands without nurse crops would occur at least 30 years later. Nutrient element costs associated with the removal of Betula ssp. wood were low compared to Populus ssp. Also, nurse crop stands had up to 2.5 times larger pools of exchangeable base cations in top mineral soils (0-30 cm) compared to mono-specific oak stands. The high soil cation pools may have resulted from reduced leaching under nurse crops or the increased recycling of cations, also from deeper soil depth, via litter fall and fine-root turnover. Our results show that forest reestablishment with pioneer tree species may be a suitable tool for the rapid recovery of forest productivity and mitigation potential following disturbances while simultaneously helping to maintain or increase soil fertility.",

Therefore, the supply of biomass from forests is considered a crucial component within the set of renewable energy options (Wiesenthal et al., 2006;Stupak et al., 2007). However, during the last few decades the intensity and frequency of disturbances caused by storms, droughts, fires, pest insect outbreaks or wet snow events in central European forests has risen measurably (Schelhaas et al., 2003;Nilsson et al., 2004). Thus, approximately 16,000 ha or 0.15% of the total forest area in Germany are annually disturbed considering the time between 1950and 2012(EFI, 2013)). At the European level such disturbances are equivalent to 8% of the total annual fellings (Schelhaas et al., 2003). Natural forest disturbances are thus a relevant aspect of central European forest management (Schelhaas et al., 2003;Nilsson et al., 2004;Majunke et al., 2008;Mantau, 2012;Albrecht et al., 2013;Kraus and Krumm, 2013). Pioneer trees could play a major role in the restoration of large disturbed areas as they can possibly accelerate forest recovery and therefore supply multiple benefits for productivity and ecosystem functioning (Alban, 1982;Man and Lieffers, 1999). Also, the cultivation of fast growing pioneer tree species such as Populus ssp. or Betula ssp. (Bazzaz, 1979;Pommerening and Murphy, 2004) may facilitate the adaptation of forests to environmental extremes and simultaneously favor the rapid sequestration of atmospheric carbon to mitigate climatic change (Messier et al., 2013;Brang et al., 2014).",
        "1a21fb10-7053-4ca7-8c76-f6fc3069dca3": "However, in forests managed on a selection basis or close to nature, silvicultural systems with pioneers are typically avoided in central Europe (Bauhus et al., 2013) in favor of those with long-lived, commercially important tree species such as Fagus ssp., Quercus ssp. or Picea ssp. Often, forest restoration with these species is realized by planting mono-specific stands, which can suffer amongst others from late frost events in large forest openings (Lundmark and H\u00e4llgren, 1987;\u00d6rlander, 1993;Groot and Carlson, 1996;\u00d6rlander and Karlsson, 2000;Agestam et al., 2003). Therefore, the capacity of forests to provide biomass may be substantially reduced, if, following disturbances, regeneration is delayed and thus productivity reduced (Osterburg et al., 2013). On the other hand, large open areas in forests offer opportunities for new, alternative and more resistant silvicultural systems. Hence, pioneer trees can be used as nurse crops, which are temporary mixtures of fast growing and light-demanding tree species in the overstorey and shade-tolerant target tree species in the understorey (Pommerening and Murphy, 2004). During the initial years of stand development, the pioneer trees facilitate the establishment of other tree species beneath their canopy. One possible nurse effect is the rapid recovery of forest micro-climate and thus the amelioration of environmental extremes, such as frost (Carlson and Groot, 1997;Schmidt-Sch\u00fctz and Huss, 1998).",
        "d960c440-ddb0-4a07-80e1-54f46b5da7cf": "Outside of central Europe, nurse crops are therefore commonly used for large or small scale reforestations (Pommerening and Murphy, 2004) following clearfelling (Keenan et al., 1995;Lieffers et al., 1996) or natural disturbances (Perala and Alm, 1990;Drouineau et al., 2000;Vallauri, 2005;Nelson et al., 2012) and for the afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands (Mander and Jogman, 2000;Gardiner et al., 2004;Uri et al., 2007). Once trees of the target species have been successfully established and start to suffer from inter-specific competition from nurse trees, the latter are typically removed (Cotta, 1828;Shepperd and Jones, 1985). Often, however, the nurse trees are just killed and not commercially harvested, because it is feared that their felling and extraction might damage the established regeneration of target species. To ensure that this biomass of nurse trees is not wasted but used, a new approach to establish widely-spaced nurse crops for the purpose of woody biomass production has been developed (Unseld and Bauhus, 2012). This approach is based on the assumption that the temporary inclusion of fast growing pioneer tree species may facilitate an early harvest of biomass and thus an earlier return of investment of stand establishment costs to the land owner. Additionally, the overall stand productivity may increase through competitive reduction between tree species (Vandermeer, 1989;Man and Lieffers, 1997) and thus a complementarity in resource use, which typically occurs when mixing light demanding overstorey with shade-tolerant understorey trees (Man and Lieffers, 1999;Richards et al., 2010;Forrester, 2014). To achieve this, nurse crops are managed on rather short rotations and a wide tree spacing is employed that facilitates harvesting of nurse trees with minimal damage to the regeneration (Unseld and Bauhus, 2012).",
        "18a1a25b-d04a-4dc4-88cc-0eedadaf998d": "Nurse crops may also improve nutrient cycling following forest disturbances, when the situation is often characterized by high mineralization rates of organic matter and reduced uptake of water and nutrients. This can lead to high rates of leaching of nutrient elements such as calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and nitrogen (N) and consequently a reduction in soil fertility (Hornbeck et al., 1986;Hendrickson et al., 1989;Bauhus and Bartsch, 1995;Yanai, 1998). These nutrient element losses may be aggravated, if the sites are subsequently used for intensive production and harvesting of biomass in nurse crops and nutrients contained therein (Sverdrup et al., 2006;Worrell and Hampson, 1997). Owing to the rapid growth and canopy closure of pioneer tree species, they have a higher nutrient and water uptake, thus reducing leaching, soil temperatures and mineralization rates, when compared to slower growing tree species (Prescott, 2002). Interactions between nurse and target tree species may further accelerate these processes and result in greater resource availability, uptake and growth (Rothe and Binkley, 2001;Forrester, 2014). While there have been many studies on the productivity or nutrient cycling in mixed-species forests (Richards et al., 2010), we are not aware of any studies that have focussed on temporary mixtures of target species such as Quercus ssp., Fagus ssp. or other with Populus ssp. or Betula ssp. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to assess whether forest restoration with widely spaced nurse crops can facilitate early biomass harvests, increase the overall stand productivity, and whether it thereby also intensifies harvest-related exports of nutrient elements such as Ca, K, Mg, N, and P when compared to conventional restoration of forest stands with the target species Quercus robur and Quercus petraea.

Thus, we hypothesize that nurse crops of broadleaved pioneer tree species can buffer disturbance-induced and/ or harvest-related reductions in soil fertility. Additionally, the study also investigated options to reduce harvest-related nutrient costs in nurse crop systems. For this purpose, the nutrient costs of biomass harvest from Populus ssp. or Betula ssp. were compared with those of several other important tree species and at different harvesting intensities. Thus, this study is the first to examine productivity as well as nutrient cycling and conservation in widely spaced, short-lived Populus ssp. or Betula ssp. nurse crops, providing the foundation for the short-term sustainable production of woody biomass from disturbed forest areas in central Europe.",

Despite supporting the trees, the roots above the ground become a distinguishing feature among the mangrove family group. Mangrove also has a cable root system that spreads laterally in the sediment [1]. From these lateral roots spread smaller roots that grow vertically downwards. This root system is shallow, generally less than 2 meters, and closely related to the mangrove strategy to adapt to extreme environmental conditions of high salinity, anoxia, and inundation [1], [2]. In addition to the above biomass, roots (belowground biomass) are an essential part of the carbon budget ( [3], [4]). The root is a source of organic C in sediments. Roots accounted for 5-25% of the total C present in sediments, became a significant source of organic C (<2mm) [5], [6]. The Estimation of carbon storage concentrates on calculating the aboveground biomass using general and species-specific allometric equations. In comparison, the belowground biomass estimation was carried out based on the general allometric equation [7].

Swamp jelutung (Dyera polyphylla) is a tree species that can be planted on peatland and combined with seasonal plants to provide multiple economic and environmental benefits. The aim of this study is to analyze the biomass and carbon stocks above and belowground in stands of swamp jelutung of an age class of 10, 13, and 17 years. (2) Methods: Observation plots were determined based on the age classes of D. polyphylla plants. The plots were determined using a purposive sampling method with a size of 20 m \u00d7 5 m with two sample plots in each class of plant age. The biomass calculation measured the diameters of living trees without causing any damage. The understory biomass was obtained by cutting and then placing in a container before weighing and recording the wet weight. The necromass was determined by measuring the diameter and length of all the wood. (3) Results: The amount of aboveground biomass (trees) was divided into 111.73 ton/ha (17 years), 55.96 ton/ha (13 years), and 50.08 ton/ha (10 years) age classes. The root biomass had the highest values of 18.36 ton/ha (17 years), 9.45 ton/ha (13 years), and 9.07 ton/ha (10 years). Meanwhile, the organic C contents in peat soil under stands of D. polyphylla were 33.45% (13 years), 31.32% (17 years), and 26.14% (10 years). (4) Conclusions: D. polyphylla trees play a role in restoring forest ecosystems on peatlands and absorb more CO 2 as the trees age. Therefore, they are useful in dealing with climate change.",

Peatland fires occur due to drought through the drainage system or forest area clearing on a large scale. After a fire incident, most living species in the forest find it challenging to return to their original states. The vegetation community differs from the original types that made up the peat forest before the incident [1]. Peatlands have distinct subsidence, irreversible drying properties, poor mineral nutrients, and high acidity but can quickly burn in the absence of water [2]. The smoke produced causes upper respiratory tract infections, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of the respiratory tract. Air quality due to peatland burning has decreased. According to the results of a study in Pelalawan Village (Riau Province), the average emissions on a sapric plot were 273 ppm CH 4 , 10,395 ppm CO 2 , and 1223 ppm CO and in hemic plots were 306 ppm, 10,678 ppm, and 2176 ppm, respectively. The content of high CO emissions means that combustion occurs completely from wet (moist) conditions [3]. The appearance can interfere with visibility, especially for flight transport. In addition, smoke from forest and land fires can Forests 2022, 13, 1297 2 of 15 reach neighboring countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, and their surrounding areas [4]. Peatlands have large terrestrial carbon stocks and are also a significant source of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, thus requiring appropriate and sustainable management. The conditions that result in the release of carbon from peatlands usually arise from human activities and peat forest fires. Carbon emissions into the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O gases are the cause of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, resulting in global warming.",

In general, this begins with the creation of various drainages for draining peatlands. Given the importance of GHG emissions on peatlands, the IPCC made the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands. According to the Supplement, CH 4 emissions from drainage canals can reach CH 4 2259 kg/ha/year or the equivalent of 47 tons of CO 2 -e/ha/year [5]. Furthermore, they are a massive carbon storehouse, recognized as an essential substance from greenhouses in global warming. Many failures of peat forest conversion to oil palm plantations have resulted in environmental degradation, such as loss of biodiversi-ty, damage to ecosystem functions, and other side effects. Forest and peatland fires release many carbon emissions to drive climate change. As a result, they destroy tropical wetland ecosystems and accelerate the process of climate change. The recovery time for forest ecosystems damaged by fire is very long, taking 30-50 years or more. Therefore, comprehensive forest fire disaster risk management is needed between ministries and government agencies, including neighboring countries, within the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Risk Management [6]. The action to restore damaged forest ecosystems includes planting tree species that live on peatlands, and a local type is chosen, which has its peculiarities. In addition, this tree species has a high commercial value compared to others. This includes balangeran (Shorea balangeran), kempas (Kompasia malaccensis), meranti rawa (Shorea pauciflora), and jelutung rawa (Dyera polyphylla), etc. Planting jelutung rawa (D. polyphylla) can provide multiple benefits for economic and environmental conservation. Furthermore, hydrological regulation techniques and appropriate agricultural practices on peatlands can benefit D. polyphylla without contributing to increased GHG emissions [7].",

The sap produced can be sold to generate income for the community around the forest. D. polyphylla has turned out to be tolerant of inundation conditions even though it had only been planted for 2 weeks [9]. This plant is the most suitable species for deep peatlands because of its high-speed growth [10]. An effort to convert peatlands into forests is through peat restoration, which has different stages of activities carried out in the form of mapping, species determination and restoration, timing, implementation, and special approaches to improve the local community's economy. An area's cultivation method and the amount of carbon-stock-lowering emissions should be determined to restore forest ecosystems on degraded peatlands of this type. This includes the knowledge of the flowering and fruiting period, where this tree flowers in some areas in November and produces ripe fruit from February to May [11]. Therefore, a strategic solution applied to reduce the greenhouse effect is planting local types of plants with superior properties that are resistant to climate change and maintain field capacity conditions. Forest and land management efforts should involve the community in a participatory manner in areas encumbered with rights. The efforts to use land are in line with the mandate of Law no. 41 of 1999 concerning Forestry, namely, \"Forestry development can increase the capacity of the community in the economic, social and environmental sustainability sectors in an equitable and environmentally friendly manner\". The calculations should measure the information on emission and absorption factors for peat swampland. The main challenge in calculating the emission levels and references is complying with monitoring, reporting, and verification principles. Information on carbon stocks in peat swampland can determine emission and absorption factors for GHG gases in the forestry sector at the national level, particularly in the Central Kalimantan Province (central Indonesia).",

Likewise, there were fluctuations in weather conditions, especially in the dry season, with higher fires. Forests on peatlands play an important role in reducing global warming because they have global carbon storage capacity in the soil and climate moderation, regulate water management, and support people's lives. The information on carbon stocks in peat swampland can become a reference for parties in making technical decisions, such as (a) the planting vegetation types to increase carbon sequestration and (b) the prediction of emissions in certain forest types and trees at the time of felling. Furthermore, peatlands have large terrestrial carbon stocks and are also a significant source of CO 2 emissions, thus requiring appropriate and sustainable management. The purpose of this research is to analyze the biomass and carbon stocks above and belowground in stands of swamp jelutung of 10-, 13-, and 17-years age class.

The growing conditions for age class I (age 17 years) were peat land with an average depth of 0.92 m, mature peat (sapric), and constant moisture due to overflowing river or brackish water. For age class II (age 13 years) and age class III (age 10 years), the peat land was relatively shallow with an average depth of 0.90 and 0.86 m, the peat was undercooked (hemic), and it was wet due to overflow or rainfall. The location of the peatlands for age classes II and III was far from the river flow, while age class I was close to the river flow. This indicated that the growing conditions of age class I were relatively more fertile than those of age classes II and III, so the amount of biomass stored in age class I was almost twice that of age class II. In addition to D. polyphylla having a high biomass content, this species also has the highest percentage of survival rate at 98%. This high percentage is because jelutung is one of the native tree species of peat swamp forests. This species is generally one of the types of trees commonly used for restoration activities. This consideration is because it has a high conservation value, and there are advantages such as good adaptability to peat swamp land, which is always inundated or periodically inundated, so that it can survive despite unfavorable environmental conditions [17].

This was because the canopy density of marsh jelutung at age class II is still relatively loose, causing a lot of sunlight to enter the floor below the stand compared to the dense canopy density at age class I. The average widths of the canopies for age classes I, II, and III, respectively, were 7.8 m, 6.1 m, and 5.8 m.

Based on Table 4, the total root biomass values for the plant age classes of 17 years, 13 years, and 10 years were 18.36 ton/ha, 9.45 ton/ha, and 9.07 ton/ha, respectively. Jelutung has a high conservation value, and there are advantages such as good adaptability to peat swamp land, which is always inundated or periodically inundated, so that it can survive despite unfavorable environmental conditions. Peat soil is rich in organic matter because it is formed from plant debris that is not completely decomposed. It is also the most important buffer for ecosystems because of its high carbon storage and water retention capacity. In addition, peat is a participatory ecosystem for carbon storage and air release and can be used as a resource for agriculture, forestry, and energy. In addition, peatlands have many regulatory, production, and economic functions [21]. The most significant contribution to the total C stored in the subsurface is peat soil as its constituent component, but statistically, this is not the case. This indicates that the vegetation of the stems and roots are also two critical components in biomass allocation. This is closely related to the amount of C stored on the upper surface. In addition, the age of the tree/stand with a diameter affects the amount of biomass contained, and the amount of litter produced by D. polyphylla stands has an impact on biomass and C stored. The aboveground and belowground biomass of D. polyphylla increased with the increasing age classes of 10, 13, and 17 years.",

Usually, it is determined by means of the graph intersection between the mean annual increment (MAI) and the current annual increment (CAI) to determine the maximum volume cycle, as has been conducted in Southeastern Brazil [22]. Thus, the measurement of the biomass of D. Polyphylla can be used for peat restoration in the context of handling climate changes as well as helping in handling forest management. Table 11 clearly shows that the amount of C stock below the surface was much larger than the C stock above the surface. In addition, the deeper the peat, the greater the carbon content. This is in accordance with the results of research on Pematang Gadung Peat Swamp Forest and Lesan River Protection Forest, Kalimantan [23].

The growth of restored mangroves induced an increase of tree biomass and a corresponding increase in vegetation carbon stocks from 3.7 MgC ha -1 at 2-year to 136.8 MgC ha -1 at 30-years. However, soil carbon stocks among restored mangrove plots spread randomly and didn't follow the sequence of mangrove tree ages.

The allometric equation of above-ground carbon stock AGC D = 0.0368D 30 2.5996 (based on stem diamater) and AGC DH = 0.0422D 30 2 H 0.8730 (based on combined stem diameter and tree height) can be used to estimate the R. apiculata carbon stocks of non-destructive measurement. However, the accuracy level of AGC D and AGC DH allometries used to estimate non-destructive R. apiculata carbon stocks was 60.14% and 79.72% to the actual carbon value of destructive study. The average aboveground carbon stocks of 2 -10 year R. apiculata were 37.2 MgC ha -1 (destructive actual value), 30.2 MgC ha -1 (D 30 2 H), and 29.9 MgC ha -1 (D 30 ) respectively. It is concluded that the estimated allometric values of aboveground biomass and carbon productions of restored mangroves are closely related to the growth of stem diameter and tree height, but its values are lower than destructive actual value.",

Biomass study based on individual species and serial age of mangrove plays an important role in tracking changes of the vegetation carbon stock.

Most of biomass, allometry and carbon studies were carried out in un-known ages and 306 The Aboveground Biomass Allometry and Carbon Stocks of Serial Age Planted Rhizophora apiculata in Northern Sumatra, Indonesia in natural mangrove forests [1]; [2]; [5]; [6]; [10] - [14]. However, there was little known about biomass and carbon stocks of serial age restored mangroves and only a few studies on restored or replanted mangroves [15]. A study on single age of replanted mangroves in Kenya showed the 12-year Rhizophora mucronata producing standing biomass of 106.7 \u00b1 24.0 ton ha -1 with accumulation rate of 8.9 ton ha -1 yr -1 [16]. Mangrove ecosystem can store more carbon (C-stocks) than other plantations because mangrove can grow faster than other species and the ecosystem has more underground organic materials [17]. Mangrove ecosystem has almost double amount of carbon stocks compared to the other tropical forest ecosystems. The high productivity of old trees shows the ability of mature mangroves to accumulate and store carbon in vegetation and sediment. CO 2 in atmosphere as well as water and nutrients from the soil are absorbed by mangroves. Within a help of sunlight for photosynthesis those components are converted into carbohydrates for tree growth. Photosynthesis in mangroves involves a complex process and is strongly influenced by physical-chemical factors of sediment and local climate. The mangrove C-stocks resulting from photosynthetic process and its sequestration are needed for identification of long-term dynamic of coastal-land management that contribute to global climate change mitigation.",

Global climate change also threatens mangrove ecosystems with the rising sea levels, changes in sea wave intensity and tropical storms, and changes in river flow towards mangrove ecosystems [21]. An increase in air temperature of 0.9\u00b0C will limit mangrove growth and change the composition of mangrove species, as well as affect microbial decomposition and decrease sedimentation processes [22]. The productivity of plant biomas in the estuarine area will also change as it has to respond to changes in time and the amounts of fresh water, nutrients and sediments. The process of accumulating C in leaves, fruits, flowers, stems, branches, twigs, stumps and proop-roots is called the sequestration process of carbon. This sequestration involves carbon capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) for a long time [23]. The CO 2 sequestration of mangrove ecosystem stored in the biomass of plant components is called vegetation carbon stock. Rhizophora apiculata was a majority species used for mangrove restoration in the Northern Sumatra, Indonesia. After several years of restoration, the natural succession of other species has grown on restoration sites. However, the field observation on each sub-plot showed the R. apiculata was the mostly dominant species. Therefore, this species was chosen for this destructive study. The destructive method was applied to the 2, 6 and 10year planted R. apiculata. Each trees' component such as leaves/fruits/flowers, stems, branches, twigs, stumps and proop-roots was separately weighed in the field. The collected samples were analysed for carbon fractions in the laboratory. Two allometries with independent variable tree Diameter (D 30 ) and combined quadratic D 30 and Height (D 30 2 H) were established.

Hook] is one of the most important plantation tree species in subtropical China, accounting for about 21 % of China's total forest plantation area. Although many studies have been conducted in Chinese fir plantations, uncertainties remain regarding its potential and dynamics to sequestrate carbon as a function of stand type, stand age and management. In this study, we applied tree ring analysis as a retrospective tool to study tree-and stand-level aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in a 17-year old Chinese fir plantation in Shitai County, Anhui Province, China. A total of 18 trees from different dominance classes were felled for the stem analyses: 6 dominant, 6 co-dominant and 6 suppressed trees. The stem analyses showed that as expected the annual increments of dbh and AGB were significantly higher for dominant trees than those for co-dominant and suppressed trees. Total stand-level AGB increased from 1.85 t ha -1 at age 3 years to 108.12 t ha -1 at age 17 years. Splitting the stand into dominance classes, tree analysis was useful to explain variation of the stand-level AGB and provided more detailed information about the growth dynamics of the stands. Tree ring analyses offer a viable and efficient approach to retrospectively study tree growth and AGB accumulation dynamics in Chinese fir plantations. In the studied stand under the given management regime, a rotation period of 17 years would optizimise AGB productivity.",

The total plantation area increased from 24 million ha in 1973 to 69 million ha in 2013 (State Forestry Adiministration 2014). While the afforestation programs are intensively conducted, there is an increase in projects that look into effectively managing the newly established plantations towards stable and sustainable functional forests. Chinese fir [(Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook] is one of the most popular plantation tree species in subtropical China with a relatively good timber quality and fast growth (Zhao et al. 2009). Currently, Chinese fir plantations cover an area of 8.9 million ha (State Forestry Adiministration 2014). Chinese fir plantations are usually managed in a clear cutting system with a rotation period of about 25 years (Wu 1984), with variations from 20 to 30 years depending on the site quality and management objectives (Wei and Blanco 2014;Wu 1984). In order to develop efficient approaches for forest management, basic data on the dynamics of aboveground biomass (AGB) with a sufficient accuracy over the relatively short rotation period is increasingly important, especially for the carbon market (Zhang et al. 2004). However, in order to determine whether such a rotation period is optimal for the production goals under the specific site condition and management options, data on tree and stand development is required. There are essentially four approaches to generate such information: (1) repeated measurements of permanent plots (Kenzo et al. 2010;Nunes et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2008aWang et al. , 2012)). However, the measurement intervals are usually about 5 or 10 years and therefore provide only limited information about inter-annual variations, particularly on the responses to climate variability (Mbow et al. 2013;Metsaranta and Lieffers 2009).",

If such repeated measurements of permanent plots are not available (2) eddy covariance flux towers offers another choice to demonstrate the interannual dynamics of forests (Wen et al. 2010). However, the installation of flux towers is very expensive and the density of such towers will never be very high, which limits its widespread application (Metsaranta and Lieffers 2009). (3) Forest growth models are another option and these come in many forms depending on the output requirements (Battaglia and Sands 1998;Zhang et al. 2013). ( 4) The fourth approach is the analysis of tree rings, which is an approach to study the growth of trees over their whole lifespan retrospectively (Scho \u00a8ngart et al. 2011;Shao et al. 2009). Tree ring analysis is a destructive approach that requires felling a number of sample trees or collecting tree ring cores at different heights. It provides data that can be used to examine various growth characteristics and offers the possibility to relate them to location or inter-annual climatic variability and forest management. Application of tree ring analysis has mainly been done for individual tree biomass dynamics, such as in Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea forests and savanna forests (Genet et al. 2010;Mbow et al. 2013), as well as to reconstruct temperature (Yi et al. 2011), precipitation (Griffin et al. 2013;Yi et al. 2011) and climate-growth relationships (Ridder et al. 2013). Tree ring analysis has also been applied for stand-level biomass estimation. For example, by coring each individual tree within inventory plots, estimated mean stand-level carbon accumulation rates in five main forest types of Europe ranged from 0.65 to 2.25 t C m -2 year -1 for the 1970-2009 period (Babst et al. 2014).",

Similarly, tree-ring analyses were used to show that aboveground carbon stock increased from 2 t C ha -1 for age 3 to 63 for age 35 t C ha -1 in a spruce plantation (Liu et al. 2012). Although the use of tree ring analyses to study the growth dynamics of individual tree dynamics has been applied in Chinese fir plantations (Cheng et al. 2013), tree ring analysis to identify growth patterns at the stand level has received little attention. This study focused on a pure Chinese fir plantation, which represents the typical management level in our study area, such as clear cut, short rotation, monoculture, thinning from below and high-level removal of biomass or volume. The objective of this study was to test whether the conventional rotation period (25-year) recommended by the local Forest Bureau is optimal in terms of productivity for the given stand. For this purpose, sample trees were felled according to their dominance classes, and tree ring analysis was applied to: (1) explore the potential applications of tree ring analysis in evaluating tree level and stand level AGB dynamics of each dominance class; (2) compare the mean and annual stand-level AGB dynamics to identify appropriate management approaches and strategies to improve stand productivity.",

The trial comprised two clones of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa\u00c2 deltoides), hybrid aspen (Populus tremula\u00c2 tremuloides), one Swedish provenance of Betula pendula, grey alder (Alnus incana), a mixture of A. incana and Salix fragilis, and a mixture of A. incana, B. pendula and Salix schwerinii. All plots were planted at a 1\u00c22 m spacing and weeded annually until canopy closure. After four growing seasons some poplar plots were fertilised with 150 kg nitrogen ha \u00c0 1 and/or thinned to 2500 trees ha \u00c0 1 . After 6 years, both poplar clones had produced 45 tonnes dry matter ha \u00c0 1 (stem + branch), and neither thinning nor fertilisation had aected their yield. During the same period the hybrid aspen, grey alder and two species mixtures had produced 24\u00b127 tonnes ha \u00c0 1 . The birch produced 14 tonnes ha \u00c0 1 in 6 years. Competition did not lead to selfthinning in any of the species. The allometric relations between stem diameter and tree weight were highly age-speci\u00aec. When allometric relations, derived from four-year-old trees, were used in measurements made the following year, biomass was underestimated by 3\u00b115%. It was concluded that within a few years after planting on a given fertile arable soil, several tree species can attain about the same level of biomass production as agricultural crops.",

Furthermore, it is the stated policy of many countries to decrease net emissions of CO 2 and increase the use of bioenergy. Production of woody biomass on agricultural land, is often considered an attractive solution since it can be applied over large land areas [1] and has little negative impact on the environment [2]. In traditional Scandinavian forestry, the major return comes decades after establishment, from a variety of valuable products. In the willow coppice system, the early and regular cash \u00afow is one of the economically most important features [3]. It would be desirable if a new production system could have the shortest possible rotation period but still produce commodities for several markets. Since a short rotation period is essential, and agricultural land is very fertile, suitable tree species should be able to rapidly increase their leaf area and give priority to above-ground growth. These are typical traits for pioneer species, such as members of the family Salicaceae, when grown on nutrient-rich soils. In Europe and North America, Populus is a commercially important genus used for intensive short rotation forestry (SRF) systems [4,5]. In Swedish coppice systems, Salix is the only genus being used. In Swedish forestry as a whole, the most abundant pioneer species are Betula pendula, B. pubescens and Populus tremula [6]. Nutrient availability is a major constraint on Swedish forest production [7,8]. This infers that wood yields on nutrient-rich agricultural soils could exceed those currently produced in conventional forestry. As shown for Salix viminalis in coppice systems, initially high production requires a dense spacing [9]. Dense planting on fertile soil is known to result in a stand structure characterised by competition eects [9,10]. Among these eects, the increase of coecient of variation (CV) in tree weight and eventual selfthinning need to be considered in relation to the intended end-product.",

This is about the same as that reported for trees on agricultural land in southern Finland [13]. The production of grey alder (Alnus incana) has been reported to be high on various types of soils [14]. For instance, in dense plantations on agricultural land, yields of 8 tonnes ha \u00c0 1 year \u00c0 1 (total above-ground dry biomass) have been reported by Granhall and Verwijst [15]. The MAI of black alder (A. glutinosa) on fertile land has been estimated at about 9 m 3 (stem volume) ha \u00c0 1 year \u00c0 1 [11].

The estimated gains in stand weight of up to 45 tonnes ha \u00c0 1 in 6 years are to our knowledge the highest juvenile yields reported from planted, non-fertilised and nonirrigated Swedish forest stands. This was true  even without correcting for the probable underestimate caused by using allometric equations from the previous year (see following discussion). Ericsson [27], who reviewed published results concerning the production of deciduous trees and conifers from all over the world, concluded that an annual stem-wood growth of more than 10 tonnes was rare. The results in the present article were obtained on non-fertilised, non-irrigated land, but in most other respects the conditions have little in common with those typically associated with Scandinavian forestry. Monteith [28], in a study including several agricultural crops, found that biomass production was linearly related to the amount of light energy intercepted by the foliage canopy. This was later shown to be valid also for Eucalyptus globulis [29], S. viminalis and P. trichocarpa [30]. Results of the present trial con\u00aerm the analogy to agricultural systems, i.e. after only four seasons most species had reached the same production level (Table 7) as that of annual agricultural crops on the same \u00aeeld [24]. Biomass in large stems is generally more valuable than biomass in small stems and branches. Hence, a system aimed at supplying products for several markets would probably not be optimised for pro\u00aetability if competition becomes so severe that it reduces the most valuable individuals' ability for rapid growth (by e.g. crown reduction). Despite the rapid growth and high plant density there were no signs in the stand structure of severe competition. S. fragilis and the silver birch were the only species indicating a competitive hierarchy, as re\u00afected in their positively skewed weight distribution (Table 6). For S. fragilis the skewness could have been due to a possible clone mix if, as suspected, the clones diered morphologically.",

The relative eect of using these two dierent estimates when calculating the weight increment in 1995 is also shown. Values presented are means (%) over the three replicates with standard error of the mean given within parentheses measure of size hierarchy, and Verwijst [10] showed that the development of a competitive hierarchy was accompanied by an increase in relative variation. Since none of the species showed any increase in relative variation over time it was concluded that the eects of competition on the stands were only moderate. If a large proportion of the future yield should be in stem boles of pulpwood dimensions the number of trees must be reduced. After a thinning procedure it is likely that light absorption and, consequently, biomass production, will drop temporarily but then slowly increase until the remaining trees have expanded their leaf area to make use of the gaps. However, in this trial the production of both poplar clones did not dier between the thinned plots and the unthinned ones. This indicates that the remaining trees were able to rapidly expand their leaf area and that these hybrids may be well suited for the production of both bioenergy and pulpwood. The susceptibility of the two poplar clones to frost is a major weakness. Based on his evaluation of modern Belgium poplars, Ilstedt [32] concluded that their phenology was not well suited for Scandinavian conditions. At present, silver birch is the only non-coppice, pioneer deciduous tree species commonly planted on fertile land in Sweden. Although no other species were anywhere near as productive as the two hybrid poplars, all tested SRF systems, except the pure silver birch stands, showed high juvenile growth. While the results allow for some conclusions concerning biomass production and early stand structure development of deciduous trees on arable soil, it is important to realise that the validity of the results is highly dependent on the validity of the biomass estimation methods.",

It was also shown that the suitability of the commonly used ``diameter at breast height'', i.e. 130 cm above ground level, was aected by tree age (Fig. 1). Biomass estimation problems in this trial were mainly connected with diculties in generalising allometric equations. Such equations can be made less site-and age-speci\u00aec by including independent variables such as individual tree height and crown dimensions [33]. However, due to the high shoot density in SRF it is generally impossible to measure more than just stem diameter on each shoot (in the current trial more than 6000 stems were measured annually). A possible solution could be to use equations that include stand age [34] or stand height [35] as independent variables. Stands develop rapidly in SRF which makes the allometric equations highly age-speci\u00aec. This has been shown for Salix [36] and was con\u00aermed here for other species as well. It is therefore concluded that biomass estimations made in SRF research trials should be based on time-speci\u00aec equations. In conclusion these results show that several deciduous pioneer tree species on arable land can Growth 1996 (kg ha \u00c0 1 ) Total biomass winter 1996/97 (kg ha reach annual production levels close to those achievable with annual agricultural crops on the same soil. Furthermore, the high level of production can be reached within just a few years after planting, with little management eort.

Fundamental to this strategy is the sequestration of carbon into long-term stable storage, either in wood products or the soil. However, the long-term effects of tree planting on soil carbon, or other soil properties, has rarely been examined.Importantly, afforestation can take many different forms, with differing effects on soil properties. Here, we evaluate how the historical afforestation of sandy heathland adopting a range of management options -including different combinations of conifers and broadleaves in monocultures and mixtures -have affected soil pH, total carbon and nitrogen concentrations, the C:N ratio, and carbon and nitrogen stocks almost a century later. We analyse these properties at a range of soil depths through the organic (litter, F and grass layers) and upper mineral soil profiles (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth). In comparison to the historical heathland sites, afforestation decreased soil pH, most dramatically under conifers, and increased the C:N ratio. However, there was overall little difference in carbon and nitrogen concentrations between alternative management options. While the total carbon and nitrogen concentrations were much higher in the organic layers of the forest options compared to the open sites, this did not translate into differences in the mineral layers.Furthermore, although we found some evidence of the transferral of carbon and nitrogen into the uppermost soil mineral layers, this was minimal in comparison to the concentrations of the organic layers. The soils at our study site are low quality and sandy, and are therefore unfavourable for incorporating organic matter, but it is still notable how little was incorporated after nearly a century of afforestation. Given the current emphasis on tree planting as a means to tackle climate change, these results demonstrate the fundamental importance of the appropriate consideration of both the afforestation management option and underlying soil type.",

It is a focus of numerous international agreements (such as the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests), national government-led initiatives (such as the UK government's aim to plant 30,000 ha of new woodland every year as part of its net zero by 2050 target) and programmes led by multilateral organisations or charities (such as the Trillion Tree Campaign) (Burton et al., 2018;Chazdon et al., 2017;Committee on Climate Change, 2020). Afforestation and reforestation have considerable potential to mitigate climate change through capturing and sequestering atmospheric carbon, although a number of important trade-offs and caveats must be considered (such as competition with agricultural land, tree species choice, previous land use and high potential water use) (Doelman et al., 2020;Griscom et al., 2017;Lewis et al., 2019). Fundamental to the ability of woodland to act as a carbon sink is long-term carbon storage, either in wood (by converting harvested wood to long-lived wood products or leaving trees unharvested) or transferred to soil carbon (slow turnover) pools. However, the ability of soils to accumulate and fix carbon, and the wider impacts of afforestation on soil quality, are seldom the focus of tree planting schemes (Friggens et al., 2020). Afforestation can take many different forms. Monoculture plantations are often favoured as they can sequester carbon rapidly, although many studies have shown that more diverse forests store more carbon and have greater long-term resilience and stability of the carbon stocks (Lewis et al., 2019;Osuri et al., 2020;Seddon et al., 2019).",
        "31faa3d8-ff8f-4e1b-94fb-627e51a82d5e": "Therefore, recommendations for the use of nature-based solutions to help mitigate climate change include the avoidance of non-native monocultures and a preference for the restoration of natural forests and forest diversification (Seddon et al., 2020b(Seddon et al., , 2020a;;Watson et al., 2018). However, most studies investigating the effects of tree species richness on carbon focus on above-ground assessments (Li et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2018). This is despite the fact that the soil carbon stock normally contains an equivalent, or even greater proportion, of the carbon stock than above-ground biomass (De Vos et al., 2015;Lal, 2005;Smith et al., 2006;Vanguelova et al., 2013). Understanding how different types of afforestation -such as with conifers or broadleaves and in monocultures or mixtures -and subsequent forest management affects below-ground carbon storage is an important dimension to the debate. Where the effects of afforestation on soil carbon have been investigated, the results have been variable, with a range of studies finding an increase, decrease or no effect of afforestation on soil carbon (Ashwood et al., 2019;Burton et al., 2018;Deng et al., 2014;Li et al., 2017;Mayer et al., 2020;Smal et al., 2019;Whitehead, 2011). Generally, there is an initial decrease in soil organic carbon immediately following afforestation due to soil disturbance, with a gradual increase in the subsequent years and decades back to pre-disturbance levels and (sometimes) beyond (Deng et al., 2014;Deng and Shangguan, 2017;Vanguelova et al., 2019). The magnitude and duration of these different stages varies and is dependent on factors such as ground preparation practices, soil type, forest type and forest management, but is an important consideration if tree planting aims to mitigate climate change (Mayer et al., 2020).",

However, these long-term studies are particularly valuable to understand how our current rapid afforestation goals may translate into long-term carbon storage. Soils perform a wide range of functions and deliver a variety of ecosystem services beyond carbon storage (Baveye et al., 2016;Drobnik et al., 2018). Soil formation is itself an important supporting service, underpinning the delivery of many other 'final' ecosystem services, although soil formation is generally such a slow process that many suggest soil should be managed as a non-renewable resource (Bardgett et al., 2011;FAO, 2015;Natural Capital Committee, 2020). Soil quality supports soil functions, soil health and is defined as an ecosystem service, due to its important role in regulating the environment, such as capturing nutrients, purifying water and buffering against atmospheric pollutants (Smith et al., 2011). Despite the focus on the benefits of afforestation for climate mitigation, it can also be a means of increasing soil quality (particularly after degradation from intensive land use) and it is important to understand the effects of alternative tree planting options on other vital soil functions. Typical indicators of soil quality are total carbon concentration, total nitrogen concentration, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) (Boerema et al., 2017;Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas, 2018). Total carbon concentration and total nitrogen concentration usually correlate with each other and with soil quality. Soil carbon has a major role in influencing other important biological, chemical and physical soil properties and is an indicator of soil organic matter content (Lal, 2005;Masciandaro et al., 2018).",
        "b6938237-bb65-418e-9bef-bd029ce3770f": "Soil organic matter is an important source of soil fertility, is a nutrient store, provides energy and substrate to microorganisms, buffers against pH changes, and increases soil aeration and water holding capacity (Jones et al., 2005;Smith et al., 2011). Soil organic matter can be separated into particulate organic matter (relatively undecomposed plant-derived material that persists in soil through occlusion in large aggregates) and mineral-associated organic matter (microscopic fragments of organic matter or single molecules that are chemically bonded to minerals) (Cotrufo et al., 2019;Lavallee et al., 2020). Although less readily available, mineral-associated organic matter is more nutrient dense and can be more easily assimilated by plants and microbes than particulate organic matter (Lavallee et al., 2020). The avoidance of leaching and increasing the retention of nitrogen are both important soil functions as nitrogen is an essential nutrient for tree growth (Vanguelova et al., 2011;Vesterdal et al., 2008). During decomposition of organic matter, nitrogen is largely retained and recycled within the soil and the trees whereas carbon is mineralised to carbon dioxide, so a lower C:N ratio indicates more thorough decomposition of organic matter (Veum et al., 2011). A low C:N ratio may relate to better soil quality as there is more nitrogen available for vegetation uptake; in contrast, a high C:N ratio may be the result of microbial nitrogen immobilisation, leading to lower productivity (Berthrong et al., 2009). However, while high nitrogen availability can indicate better soil quality, it can also lead to increased nitrogen leaching (particularly in soils with C:N ratio of less than 25), with negative implications for water quality (Sutton et al., 2011). Afforestation is also well known to affect soil pH (Hornung, 1985).",

Changes in soil pH affect soil properties and biogeochemical processes, with repercussions on the wider ecosystem functioning, structure and diversity (Hong et al., 2018;Janssens et al., 2010;Kunito et al., 2016;Stevens et al., 2010). The effects of afforestation on soil pH vary by tree species. In general, forest soils tend to be more acidic than equivalent soils under grassland vegetation (Berthrong et al., 2009;Chapin et al., 2002;Hong et al., 2018;Jackson et al., 2005), which seems to be caused mainly through the redistribution of cations (increased cation uptake by trees causing localised acidification in the upper soil layers) (Berthrong et al., 2009;Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2003). Trees are also effective at scavenging atmospheric pollutants, leading to increased deposition and acidification under forest canopies where air pollution is high (Guerrieri et al., 2015;Vanguelova et al., 2011Vanguelova et al., , 2010)). Due to both a greater canopy surface area and aerodynamic roughness, conifers scavenge atmospheric deposition more efficiently than broadleaved species (Augusto et al., 2002;De Schrijver et al., 2007;Guerrieri et al., 2015). Conifers also have a more acidic leaf litter than broadleaves. Taking these two factors together, conifers therefore tend to acidify soils more than broadleaved species (De Schrijver et al., 2007;Hornung, 1985). A global meta-analysis found that afforestation with Eucalyptus, Pinus, and other conifers significantly decreased pH, while there was no change for other angiosperms (Berthrong et al., 2009). The impact of afforestation on soil pH may also vary by location.",

A large study in China found that afforestation neutralises soil pH as it raises pH in acidic soil but lowers pH in alkaline soil (Hong et al., 2018). Despite recognition of the fundamental importance of soil for forests, it is often not routinely monitored within the commercial forestry industry. Understanding the localised and specific impact of past management on soil properties is important for considering future management, so this represents a key opportunity for improvement. Here we explore how alternative historical afforestation options on sandy heathland have affected soil properties, including pH, and carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stocks. We compare a range of combinations of broadleaves and conifer species in mixtures and monocultures, as well as historical and recently reverted heathland sites. Sandy soils have a number of properties that make them less amenable to change through land management. For example, they are less able to bind and accumulate carbon and are therefore already close to their carbon saturation potential (i.e. the maximum carbon that can be sequestered and stored by the soil) (Angers et al., 2011). They are also prone to the leaching of nutrients. It is therefore particularly interesting to evaluate the effects of afforestation on sandy soil properties, especially over long time periods.",

Much research have been conducted to evaluate biomass and productivity of different mangrove forests across the world (Putz and Chan, 1986;Komiyama et al., 2000;Khan et al., 2005;Bracking, 2014;Vinh et al., 2019). Thus, these ecosystems store a high value of carbon not only in their soil (Twilley et al., 1992;Bouillon et al., 2008;Donato et al., 2011) but also in above ground biomass (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB). Alongi (2009) reported that mangrove forests can store in averages 247.4 Mg ha -1 in above ground biomass, a similar value to the global average for tropical terrestrial forests. In Southeast Asia, the area of mangrove forests has declined significantly over the past five decades due to population pressure, wood extraction and conversion to other land uses (Phan and Hoang 1993;Ong et al., 1995;Mcnally et al., 2010). Since the mid-1990s, social communities have begun to appreciate the true value of mangroves, raise awareness on the impacts of forest loss and leading to efforts to protect and restore this ecosystem.

Of these, thousand hectares of mangroves have been replanted in the northern coast of Viet Nam, and nowadays, over 10,000 ha are turned into forests (Mcnally et al., 2010;MARD, 2016). The mangrove vegetation in Vietnam is mainly occupied by Kandelia obovata a Sheue, H. Y.Liu & J.Yong and few individuals of Sonneratia caseolaris (L.) Engl., and Rhizophora stylosa Griff. Previous studies have examined the forest structure and the allometric biomass of K. obovata at the young stage of the plant lifecycle, and have focused on the below ground carbon (Nguyen et al., 2004;Cuc et al., 2009;Ha et al., 2018). However, there have been no examinations of the above ground primary productivity of the plantation in relation with the stand age from young throughout mature stages of this plantation. Mangrove biomass is a complex trait affected by forest structures and ecological processes, which are keys to ecosystem functions and services. Understanding the structure and above ground biomass of mangrove forests are important steps in planning the protection and sustainable use of mangrove resources (Medeiros and Sampaio, 2008;Fu and Wu, 2011). Especially, in the area where planted forest (secondary mangroves) constitute the largest proportion, the structure and biomass of the plantation at all the growing stages are the fundamental ecosystem characteristics for management.

Three chronosequences were established on calcareous and three on acidic bedrocks. Stand elevation and mean annual precipitation of the chronosequences were different. Maximum stand age was 93 years on acid and 112 years on calcareous bedrocks. Stem biomass increased with stand age and reached values of 250-400 t C ha \u00c01 in the oldest successional stands. On acidic bedrocks, the organic layers accumulated linearly during forest succession at a rate of 0.34 t C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 . On calcareous bedrocks, a maximum carbon stock in the humus layers was reached at an age of 60 years.Total carbon stocks in stem biomass, organic layers and the mineral soil increased during forest development from 75 t C ha \u00c01 in the meadows to 350 t C ha \u00c01 in the oldest successional forest stands (2.75 t C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ). Carbon sequestration occurred in stem biomass and in the organic layers (0.34 t C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 on acid bedrock), while mineral soil carbon stocks declined.Mineral soil carbon stocks were larger in areas with higher precipitation. During forest succession, mineral soil carbon stocks of the upper 50 cm decreased until they reached approximately 80% of the meadow level and increased slightly thereafter. Carbon dynamics in soil layers were examined by a process model. Results showed that sustained input of meadow fine roots is the factor, which most likely reduces carbon losses in the upper 10 cm. Carbon losses in 10-20 cm depth were lower on acidic than on calcareous bedrocks. In this depth, continuous dissolved organic carbon inputs and low soil respiration rates could promote carbon sequestration following initial carbon loss.At least 80 years are necessary to regain former stock levels in the mineral soil.",

By agricultural land-use, forestry and building of infrastructure, humans inter-fere with natural or seminatural ecosystems. While tropical deforestation continues and even accelerates in some regions (Laurence et al., 2004), more and more agricultural land in Europe (Rabbinge & van Diepen, 2000) and North America (Foster & Motzkin, 2003) is set aside and becomes afforested. Both types of land-use changes have consequences not only for biodiversity, human nutrition, or the availability of clean water, but also strongly affect the carbon pools in soils and vegetation. Despite carbon losses because of fossil fuel emissions and deforestation, the Earth's land surface also offers a great potential for carbon sequestration. Concerns about climatic change caused by elevated CO 2 have led to the Kyoto protocol. Besides a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, the Kyoto protocol allows for accounting of emission reductions by afforestation (planting of trees on former arable land or grassland) or reforestation (planting or natural regeneration of trees on arable land or grassland, which had been forest before cultivation by humans). Currently, forest carbon sinks are the only accountable biological sinks, and therefore, receive considerable attention. Afforestation and forest regeneration clearly increase the amount of carbon stored in vegetation biomass. Less known and still under debate are changes in soil carbon: in recent years, several studies on the development of soil carbon stocks after afforestation of former arable land (ploughed to grow cereals, vegetables, etc.) mainly in the US have shown losses (Hamburg, 1984;Richter et al., 1999), gains (Schiffman & Johnson, 1989;Huntington, 1995;Hooker & Compton, 2003) or initial losses followed by slight increases in later stages of forest development (Johnston et al., 1996).",

Concerning mitigation of climate change, it is an important question if a longer lasting mineral soil carbon sequestration or loss takes place besides the short-term sequestration in plant tissue. It is still unclear which mechanisms determine an increase or decline in mineral soil carbon stocks. Only some climatic factors like precipitation have been examined concerning their influence on mineral soil carbon stocks (Guo & Gifford, 2002;Jackson et al., 2002), whereas soil immanent parameters like parent material, particle size distribution, or root turnover have not been investigated in the past. As a consequence of industrial development, traditional agropastoral systems in the Alps collapsed, leading to the abandonment of remote or unproductive areas (Laiolo et al., 2004). Depopulation in these rural areas as well as reductions in cattle stocking levels are long-term trends which peaked after the Second World War and are still omnipresent (Dirnbo \u00a8ck et al., 2003).

The aim of the present study was to verify these results by the investigation of a broad range of spruce chronosequences on different bedrocks and in different climatic regions covering a period of approximately 100 years.

In the following, the processes leading to changed carbon stocks in the organic layers and the mineral soil are discussed in more detail, because soil carbon stocks play a vital role as long-term carbon stocks given that they are generally regarded as more stable (Garten & Ashwood, 2002) than carbon stored in organic layers or vegetation which can easily be destroyed or harvested.",

Assisting the regeneration of endangered and shade tolerant tree species is essential for both the recovery of this vulnerable group and of ecological processes. However, there is limited species-specific information regarding tree performance under different disturbance conditions with which to implement effective interventions.2. We assessed the performance of shade tolerant tree seedlings in restoration plantings under different disturbance settings and determined whether leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf dry mass content (LDMC)-functional traits typically associated with resource capture or stress tolerance-could serve as predictors of survival and growth among species. Since conservative leaf morphological traits can maximize survival, we expected species with higher LMA and LDMC to present higher survival. For a set of eight native cloud forest species, a total of 2,202 seedlings were planted in four pastures, five secondary forests and three forests subjected to traditional selective logging, in TMCF landscapes in Eastern Mexico.3. Seedling survival was high after 3 years: 62% in pastures, 80% in secondary forests and 88% in logged forests. Growth rates were lowest in pastures, followed by secondary forests and highest in logged forests. LMA was a strong predictor of seedling survival in all of the environments; tree species with higher LMA presented greater survival. LDMC was related to seedling survival in the three environments, although to a lesser extent than LMA. In the pastures, higher LMA and LDMC were linked to lower growth. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study supports the potential of shade tolerant tree species in restoration efforts to assist the recovery of this important functional group and to accelerate succession across altered environments.Our results support the notion that conservative leaf functional traits are linked to a higher probability of survival, not only in the shaded understorey, but also under high solar radiation in transformed habitats.

Postmining reclamation is therefore imposed to recover the vegetation despite the lack of understanding which indicators can be used to monitor the progress of succession. This study proposes an integrated framework to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in coal mining site in East Kalimantan, Borneo. We combine the indicators of floristic diversity of naturally growing terrestrial and epiphytic plants, survival and growth of enrichment planting of native plants, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the measurements on micro-climate and soil conditions. We compare some indicators across the 9-year-old and 17-year-old reclaimed sites and the premining sites. The results showed that naturally growing vegetation at the reclaimed sites was at the early to midsuccession stages, with biodiversity indicators much lower than those at the premining areas, implying the necessity of native species planting. During a six-month monitoring, the enrichment planting of native species had high rates of survival and growth. Surprisingly, the above-ground carbon at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining sites. While the micro-climates had been improved, the soils in the reclaimed sites were still in poor conditions. Our findings suggest that using single parameter to monitor the trajectory of vegetation succession in postmining reclamation can be biased, and integrating several monitoring measures would provide a much better assessment.",

This method of mining requires above-ground vegetation clearing and top-soil removal (Lei et al, 2016;Saini et al., 2016). While these activities are generic in open-cast mining across many areas globally, the impacts are much more devastating in tropical regions. This is because tropical forests host a huge number of biodiversity compared to other realms (Gibson et al., 2011). For example, for the group of trees, there are 40,000-53,000 species estimated to occur in tropical forests (Slik et al., 2015). Beside the impacts on biodiversity, the loss of vegetation due to open-cast mining in tropical forest also removes the aboveground biomass, which is rich in organic carbon. In Borneo, intact forest in lowland areas could store in average 477 ton/ha of above-ground biomass (Budiharta et al., 2014). As such, if left unchecked, open-cast mining in tropical forest could be double threats for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Despite the devastating impacts, the mining sector has been booming in many tropical regions, including in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) (Resosudarmo et al., 2009). In East Kalimantan alone, as many as 1476 coal mining permits have been issued with a total extent of 5,406,566 hectares (Subarudi et al., 2016). While generating economic benefits, stakeholders related to mining sector, especially governments, are aware with the negative consequences of open-cast mining on the environment. Therefore, a set of regulations is issued by governments to control the mining operation on the ground to minimize the impacts, including those related to postmining reclamation activities. For example, the Indonesian government through Government Regulation No. 26, 2020 states the obligation of mining permit holders to carry out reclamation on postmined site.

This is particularly eminent for the knowledge related the ecological succession process following reclamation on postmined sites, moreover in tropical forests which is considered as the most complex ecological systems on the earth (Gardner et al., 2009). Succession is a dynamic and continuous process which occurs gradually over time. After a disturbance, succession can be happening from several decades to a century as in the case of postmined reclamation site (Brady & Noske, 2010;Popelkov\u00e1 & Mulkov\u00e1, 2018). In many cases, postmined reclamation requires various interventions to assist and accelerate the succession, including geomorphological and hydrological modifications, top-soil preparation, and revegetation (Silva et al., 2018;Lowry et al., 2019;Shrestha et al., 2019). When vegetation cover is absent, such as in open cast mining site, assisted revegetation through direct seeding of cover crops, intensive planting of pioneer trees and enrichment planting of native plants are the common methods to improve soil quality and microclimates, and to restore the productivity and vegetation cover (Bell, 2001;Sheoran et al. 2010;Lestari et al., 2019).

In particular, the information on what indicators that can be used to assess the succession trajectories have not been clearly defined yet. Previous studies on the monitoring of succession progress in postmining reclamation site mostly focused on one or two indicators, such as above-ground carbon (e.g., Ahirwal & Maiti, 2017;Ahirwal et al., 2017), or natural regeneration and soil conditions (e.g., Novianti et al., 2018). We argue that considering solely single measure of succession indicator could be misleading, since such measure does not necessarily represent ecological integrity of the whole landscape. Here, we develop a unique, yet simple, approach of using the combined measures of biodiversity indicators of recolonizing (naturally-grow) terrestrial and epiphytic plants, the survival and growth of enrichment planting of native species, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the variables of micro-climate and soil to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in reclaimed coal mining sites in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. We compare some of such measures among three different sites, i.e. a 9-year-old reclaimed site, a 17-year-old reclaimed site, and premining sites, in order to investigate the direction of the succession progress.

In doing so, we combined several measures, i.e., biodiversity indicators of naturallygrow terrestrial and epiphytic plants, the growth and survival of enrichment planting of native species, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and abiotic factors. In previous studies, such measures were common to apply separately (e.g., Ahirwal et al., 2017;Gastauer et al., 2018) with lack of context of tropical forests. In the context of the studied area, the outcome of revegetation efforts in the reclamation sites indicated that the natural regeneration at the reclaimed sites were at the early to mid-succession stages. Although the diversity, richness and evenness indicators of naturally recolonizing terrestrial vegetation were at moderate to high levels, these only occurred on two strata of vegetation, namely understorey and saplings (Table 1). Even until the age of 17 years of reclamation, the more mature vegetation that grew spontaneously had not been found. Our findings regarding natural regeneration of understorey and saplings plants were in accordance with Novianti et al. (2018) who also found rapid recolonization of ground cover vegetation, especially for graminoids, herbs and shrubs, in a postcoal mining site in South Kalimantan five years after reclamation began. Yet, due to the absence of a more mature vegetation, our study suggests that the recovery was not so rapid as stated by Novianti et al., (2018). When compared to the premining areas, which were degraded forests following selective logging and fires, the floristic diversity indicators at the reclaimed sites were much lower (Table 1).",

Furthermore, the recolonized terrestrial plants in the reclamation sites had a large portion of exotic species with some of them were considered as invasive (Hapsari et al, 2020). On the other hand, the results of the vegetation analysis of recolonization of epiphytic plants demonstrated that the reclaimed sites seemed more habitable for these plants since there was a number of epiphytic plants grew on the pioneer trees (Figure 3 and Table 3). In particular there were three species of epiphytic orchid attached on the host trees. However, the species and abundance of the orchids in the reclaimed site are different with the orchids that grow in primary forest in East Kalimantan (Trimanto & Sofiah, 2018). Epiphytic plants have an important role in forest ecology because they can be used as bioindicators of the conditions of abiotic factors and climate change (Zotz & Bader, 2009). In primary forests with healthy ecosystems, epiphytes are more diverse than in disturbed forests, since the presence of epiphytes is related with tree diversity (Barthlott et al., 2001). Combining the natural regeneration in both terrestrial and epiphytic plants suggest that the succession in the reclaimed sites had been progressing, with particular favour on the upperground habitats. However, the succession trajectory was still far away to resemble the vegetation conditions as at the premining areas. Therefore, several management interventions, including enrichment planting of native trees, are necessary to accelerate the recovery of biodiversity elements of the vegetation. Such intervention is now increasingly advocated in mining sectors (Doley et al., 2012;Swab et al., 2017) although there has been limited empirical evidence to support such premise, especially in the context of tropical landscape.",

In particular interest, the planted native plant species from Dipterocarpaceae family were well adapted. Similar finding was also revealed by Lestari et. al, (2019) in which several native plants from Dipterocarpaceae family could adapt well in a post coal mining reclamation area in East Kalimantan although the presence of inundated water and soil acidity became the limiting factors. In our study, we noted no inundated water at the observation plot with soil pH value ranged from 4.66-4.75 and 4.32-4.51 at the 9-year-old and the 17-year-old reclaimed sites, respectively although the acidity of the soil in both sites is not different. The high acidity of the soil in both reclamation sites with pH < 5 was due to oxidation of residual elements of coal particularly iron sulphide. The planted native plant species will add the biodiversity value of the reclaimed sites, since we found only limited number of native plant species that grew spontaneously on the reclamation sites. While the indicators of natural regeneration at the reclaimed sites were poorer than those at the premining sites, surprisingly the above-ground carbon storage at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining site (Table 8). The estimated value of carbon stock of pioneer trees in reclamation area was 90.42 ton/ha at the 9-year-old reclaimed site and 129.58 ton/ha at the 17-yearold, it is equivalent to a regenerating forest.",
        "6125593c-3567-4d73-a637-82fa3db8c4d8": "When compared with carbon stored in lowland primary forest in Kalimantan (Krisnawati et al., 2014), the carbon stock in the 17-year-old reclamation site is approximately half of that in the primary forest. If the process of forest succession in the reclamation area continues, the carbon stock is expected to increase. The high carbon storage in the reclaimed sites is due to the intensive planting of fast-growing pioneer trees, such as Albizia saman and Senna siamea, while on the contrary at the premining sites there were only few trees remained, mostly in small and medium sizes, since the landscapes were in degraded condition caused by logging and fires. While storing carbon in the form of tree biomass, the planting of pioneer trees also helped to improve the micro-climate conditions, mainly due to the increasing canopy cover as indicated by the temperature and sunlight intensity which were lower at the 17-year-old reclaimed site than those at the 9-year-old (Table 9). The occurrence of recolonizing epiphytic plants on the pioneer trees also supported the premise that the microclimate at the reclaimed site had been enhanced. Litter fall from the pioneer trees could also improve soil conditions since open-cast mining can cause loss of concentrations of organic carbon, soil nitrogen and change in soil pH to be more acidic (Shrestha & Lal, 2011). The accumulation of C and N in the soil layer is an important factor that determines many other soil biological properties (Frouz et al., 2013). Yet, C/N ratio was still better at the premining sites than that at the reclamation sites in which the C/N ratio greatly determines the presence of soil microbes (Hogberg et al., 2007). There was no significant difference in pH value, C organic and N total between the premining area and the reclamation sites. Edaphic or soil conditions may have a strong effect on vegetation productivity (Foster and Bhatti 2006).",
        "5206dfa6-53c5-41cb-a43d-16600695fa4c": "In general, the soils at the reclamation sites were in poor conditions according to the threshold value prescribed by Center for Soil and Agro-Climate Research (1983) (Table 9). It is not surprising since the soil conditions at the premining sites were also poor, which is the characteristic of soils in Kalimantan (Paoli et al., 2006). We found the level of soil macronutrients in the reclamation sites varied. For example, Phosphorus (P) which functions in root and flower development was very low, while Kalium which functions in photosynthesis was very high. Similarly, there was variability in micronutrient contents. A very low content was found in Fe and Mn, while Aluminum (Al) saturation was moderate. This condition is good since the high concentration of Al can be toxic to plants. There was no significant difference in the value of cation exchange capacity (CEC) between the premining site and the reclamation areas. The value of CEC in the both reclamation areas was categorized as low, while the base saturation (BS) value was low at the older reclamation site and medium at the younger reclamation site. These values indicate that the cations available for plants to grow are low. Forest clearing causes a drastic loss of CEC and cations (Zajicova and Chuman 2019), degrading the quality of the soils. The soil degradation in the reclamation site is also confirmed by the fact that Ca and Mg contents were also not significantly different between the three locations. Nonetheless, based on soil texture, the older reclamation site had better soil texture than the younger reclamation site since the sandy soil in the older reclamation site has better porosity for plant root development. Several studies have shown that soil conditions can be improved through the addition of organic matter (e.g., animal manure, crop residues, and organic waste). Organic compounds can be added into reclamation area to activate the microbial population in the reclaimed soil.",
        "5b7badbf-4d93-4e9b-b8d2-13f891125687": "Pyrogenic Carbonaceous Material (PCM) and Pig Manure (PM) have been tested to contribute to the improvement of soil structure and stubborn organic matter (C). They also decrease the mobility of metals (Zornoza et al., 2016). Acid soil with low pH value can be overcome by making drainage and adding alkaline materials such as calcite (CaCO 3), dolomite [CaMg (CO3) 2], burnt lime (CaO), slag [CaSiO3], and slaked [Ca (OH) 2] (Negim 2009). Microbial bio-inoculants can be applied to increase soil fertility and are useful in soil phytoremediation (Khan, 2005;Khalid et al., 2009). The application of microbes in mine site rehabilitation is a cost effective, green and sustainable approach (Thavamani et al., 2017). In conclusion, our study contributes to a new understanding that using single indicator as a monitoring tool to assess revegetation success in postcoal mining site can be biased. A more comprehensive, yet simple, approach by integrating several measures of floristic conditions as demonstrated in this study would provide a much better assessment on the trajectory of vegetation succession of minesite reclamation. Also, to our knowledge, this study is the first that observing the occurrence of recolonizing epiphytic plants in postmining reclamation area. Therefore, vegetation analysis of epiphytic plants can be used as an element of monitoring indicators with a simpler application than other indicators. In the context of policy and management implications, our findings suggest that while it is relatively easy to recover the above-ground biomass in postmining reclamation, it is not the case for biodiversity. Therefore, enrichment planting using native plant species is necessary to accelerate the biodiversity recovery of the vegetation in postmining reclamation site. While there are several government regulations that impose the planting of native species on postmined land, our study provides empirical evidence to back up such government measures.",

These overburdens are mostly acidic in nature with very scarce organic matter contents. The mine spoils are not fit for plant growth, as they possess either very coarse texture, or very compacted texture, which renders low water retention capacity to the spoils, resulting into poor drainage (Jha and Singh 1992). All these characteristics make them unfavorable for plants as well as microbial growth. Nevertheless, mine spoils also interfere with soil water relationship, consequently restricting plant growth. Mine spoils are contaminated in the sense that these are devoid of soil microbes, organic matter, soil moisture and plant available nutrients. Moreover, they consist of excess amount of heavy metals (Singh et al. 1996). Nitrogen is usually deficient in mine spoils and limits vegetation establishment and sustained productivity. The mine spoils are poor in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and moderately rich in heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu). Soil macroclimatic conditions vary in different ecosystems, which affect the microbial activity and biomass. Consequently, the overall N cycle is affected (Paul and Clark 1996). Available soil moisture is the key factor in the functioning of the ecosystem in tropical countries (Lodge et al. 1994). Nitrogen is usually deficient in mine soils and limits vegetation establishment and sustained productivity. However, the mine spoils are not phytotoxic (Singh et al. 1996). According to Society for Ecological Restoration's (2002) definition, \"Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.\" These restoration strategies must address soil structure, microbe populations, and nutrient cycling in order to return the land as closely as possible to its predisturbance condition and continue as a self-sustaining ecosystem. A restoration programme not only helps restoring the soil fertility, but also enhances the biological diversity (Dobson et al. 1997;Singh andSingh 2001, 2006).",

Vegetation is a regulatory factor towards the reconstruction of an ecosystem and mine soil, as it improves the physical and biological diversity of disturbed sites. Tree plantation is supposed to be the best tool for reclamation of mine spoils (Singh et al. 2002), because the trees not only provide long-term ecosystem stabilization and render potential ameliorative effects on soil quality, but also have potential commercial and aesthetic value (Torbert et al. 1993;Fisher 1990;Ashby 1987). Plantations exert a cat-alytic effect in the mine spoil restoration, by changing the understorey microclimatic conditions (viz. increased soil moisture, reduced temperature, etc.), increased vegetational-structural complexity, and development of litter and humus layers, which occur during the early years of plantation growth (Singh et al. 2002).",

Mining operations degrade significant areas of land and replace existing ecosystems with undesirable waste materials in the form of mine spoil dumps. Mine spoils possess very harsh conditions for both plant and microbial growth because of low organic matter contents, and other unfavorable physico-chemical characteristics (Singh and others 2002). Mine spoil is very scarce in organic matter, soil microbes, soil moisture and plant available nutrients, and consists of greater amount of heavy metals, hence treated as contaminated. To restore such degraded lands is a challenging ecological task. In disturbed habitats, the natural recovery takes much longer time through colonization of plant and animal species (Sharma and Sunderraj 2005). Restoration programmes help to restore the soil fertility and enhance the biological diversity (Singh andSingh 2001, 2006). Tree plantation is one of the best tools for reclamation of mine spoils (Fisher 1990;Torbert and Burger 1993;Singh and others 2002) and a common and efficient approach used to accelerate forest formation on degraded areas (Wang andothers 2007 andRobinson andHandel 1993). Reforestation can facilitate forest succession by providing an understory environment favorable for native plant recruitment (Chapman and Chapman 1996;Oberhauser 1997). Plant species may be used as indicators of mine spoil/overburden chemistry. (http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/ minres/districts/cmdp/chap12.html). According to Filcheva and others (2000), trees, being efficient biomass generators, add more organic material (both above-and below-ground) to the soil and are associated with a relatively large array of soil organisms, including earthworms (Banov and others 1995).",

Soil organic carbon was measured in pasture, silvopastoral tree, and woodland treatments at six depths representative of 0-150 cm. Fourteen years after tree planting, the organic carbon content in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) as greatest in the pasture (6.0 g 100 g -1 ) and least in the woodland (4.6 g 100 g -1 ); the value (5.3 g 100 g -1 ) below the silvopastoral trees was intermediate. In the 10-20 cm layer, the organic carbon content in the woodland was 13% lower than the pasture. No treatment effects on soil carbon were detected below 20 cm. Possible reasons for the decline in surface soil carbon include a decline in grass cover and reduced soil water content. Measurements of above ground carbon storage by the trees indicated that tree planting increased overall carbon storage, with the silvopastoral system predicted to achieve a higher level of carbon storage than equivalent areas of separate woodland and pasture.

It can offer benefits in terms of improving animal welfare (Broom et al., 2013), reducing runoff (Udawatta et al., 2011) and increasing land productivity (Graves et al., 2007). It is also widely cited as having great potential for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon (IPCC, 2000;Montagnini and Nair, 2004;Jose, 2009;Mosquera-Losada et al., 2011;UNEP 2011). However whilst planting trees on grassland will undoubtedly lead to an accumulation of above ground carbon, it may not increase the level of soil organic carbon (SOC). Existing large meta-analyses have shown that tree planting on pasture, at least in the short term, can lead to declines in soil organic carbon (Post and Kwon, 2000;Paul and Polglase, 2002;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Laganiere et al., 2010;Shi et al., 2013). Guo and Gifford (2002) and Kirschbaum et al. (2008) suggest that such losses tend to be exacerbated in areas of high rainfall. By contrast, other authors suggest that the losses may be restricted to the most labile 'light fraction' or particulate organic matter (POM), and stocks may recover over a long enough time span (Paul et al., 2003;Huang et al., 2011;Hoogmoed et al., 2012). Very few studies consider the effect on SOC of silvopastoral systems where the trees are planted to allow continued grazing on all or part of the land. Unlike woodland systems, silvopastoral trees allow lateral access of solar radiation and grass cover can be maintained below the trees.",

In addition root carbon is known to be more recalcitrant than shoot carbon (Jackson et al., 1997;Rasse et al., 2005,), and the increased diversity of species may increase soil stocks (Stockmann et al., 2013). One of the difficulties in attempting to assess changes in SOC is that the magnitude of any change tends to be very small in relation to the variation (Hungate et al., 1995;Kravchenko and Robertson, 2011). This high coefficient of variation (CV) in turn results in low experimental power, i.e. a poor ability the separate any signal from the noise. Shi et al. (2013), Upson and Burgess (2013) and Harper and Tibbett (2013) have all highlighted the importance of sampling sufficiently deeply for SOC. However increasing the depth of sampling also lowers the experimental power as the CV tends to be greater with increased sampling depth. For this reason, post-hoc power analyses are useful for determining if the experiment can be expected to result in type II errors, i.e. the incorrect conclusion that there are no differences in SOC between treatments. During the 1990s, a number of agroforestry experiments and demonstration sites were established on agricultural land in the UK (Burgess et al., 2000(Burgess et al., , 2005;;Sibbald et al., 2001).

The growing stock and current annual increment (CAI) of 16-years-old grey alder stand were 250 m 3 ha -1 and 35.6 m 3 ha -1 , respectively.

A new yield table was elaborated for natural grey alder stands growing at fertile sites. The average growing stock and increment of grey alder stands were lower than those presented in earlier yield tables compiled in Estonia or in the other Baltic or Nordic states. It can be explained by an uneven spatial distribution of trees in natural grey alder stands; because of this, the production of different alder stands of the same age was highly variable. However, some stands were characterised by remarkably high production, which indicates the high growth potential of this tree species. The bulk maturity of grey alder stands is achieved at the age of 12-13 years. However, the recommendable optimal harvesting age of grey alder stands could be 20-25 years, as annual woody biomass increment was high even after the age of 20 years.

However, yield tables are usually quite region specific, which is due to different climatic and soil conditions (Aosaar et al., 2012) and which also creates a need for specific growth models. According to our earlier study (Aosaar et al., 2012), only seven grey alder yield tables were available, and even these had been compiled more than a half-century ago. Despite the increased economic value of grey alder, no comprehensive update for the yield potential in changing climate and land use conditions has been provided. However, the changed environment and growing conditions (large-scale drainage, increased atmospheric CO 2 level, increased annual temperature, etc.) may considerably affect forest growth on the regional scale. The increased growth of European forests during the last half-century, reported in several papers (Nilson et al., 1999;Mund et al., 2002;Norby et al., 2005), can mainly be explained by climate change and increased CO 2 level in the atmosphere. A similar phenomenon has occurred also in Estonian forests; when in 1970 the average annual increment of Estonian forests was 2.6 m 3 ha \u00c01 (Valk and Eilart, 1974) then in 2011 it was 5.8 m 3 ha \u00c01 (Yearbook Forestry 2011). Also land use changes which took place during the last half-century may have a marked influence on forest growth. A considerable part of Estonian grey alder stands are growing on previous agricultural lands and such forests are highly productive owing to fertile soils. Hence, we set the hypothesis that the actual productivity of Estonian natural grey alder stands at fertile sites is higher than that reflected in existing yield tables.",
        "abaefefd-a3cf-42d9-90fa-79b147e9fee3": "Another important issue is accumulation of carbon (C) in different forest ecosystems around the world. The stock of C sequestered in the biomass and soil of various forest ecosystems has been estimated in numerous studies (Cannell, 1999;Pussinen et al., 2002;Mund et al., 2002;Laiho et al., 2003;Paul et al., 2003;\u00c5gren and Hyv\u00f6nen, 2003;Uri et al., 2012). Also great efforts have been made to clarify the role of forests in C sequestration, driven by the requirement to report the data of organic C accumulation and C balance at the country level. According to the Kyoto Protocol, governments are requested to report C pool changes in forests (e.g. LULUCF). Yield tables are a tool for estimation of C sequestration in forest ecosystems, as biomass production and C accumulation are strongly related. A better knowledge of the functioning of forest ecosystems would allow to effectively implement different silvicultural methods for improving the C sequestration capability of forests. Both forest biomass and soils are considered to have large potential for temporary and long term C storage (Gower, 2003;Houghton, 2005). However, the proportion of C accumulated in the soil and in biomass depends on several factors, among them species composition, soil, water regime, climate, etc. According to literature data, forest soils store a substantial amount of C, often more than the forest vegetation does (Peltoniemi et al., 2004). According to the EC/UN-ECE (2003) report, forest soils in Europe store roughly 1.5 times as much C as the trees. Earlier studies indicate that grey alder stands have great potential for accumulating a considerable amount of C both in the biomass of trees and in the soil during a quite short period (Uri et al., 2011;Aosaar et al., 2013).",
        "de469ee4-e89b-4bab-a477-62ad758feba7": "However, in fertile silver birch chronosequence stands the main C sink was the biomass of trees and the soil C storage pool remained stable (Uri et al., 2012) owing to intensive soil respiration (Varik et al., submitted for publication). Thus it was expected also in the present study carbon accumulation in the woody biomass of trees exceeds soil carbon sequestration in grey alder stands from young to mature age. The aims of present study were: -to provide new data about the growth and productivity of natural grey alder stands from young to mature age and to compile a new up-to-date yield table; -to establish optimal rotation length for short-rotation grey alder stands at fertile sites on the basis of bulk maturity age; -to estimate carbon accumulation in the above-ground biomass and soil of grey alder chronosequence stands; -to evaluate plant-soil interactions in grey alder stands (effect on soil nitrogen, available phosphorus, and pH status).",

Analog forestry aims to strengthen rural communities, both socially and economically, with tree plantings of high biodiversity, which provide commercial products and resiliency, while avoiding agrochemicals and fossil fuels. The latter links this strategy to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, but there has been little analysis comparing the potential for above-and below-ground carbon storage in analog forests, as compared with more typical reforestation efforts via single-species plantations. We present the results of a study to estimate carbon sequestration levels, above-and below-ground, from an experimental analog forest system and a teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantation system, in comparison with a degraded pasture system. The study found that the analog and teak plantation forest systems stored higher quantities of total carbon (178 and 141 t C ha -1 , respectively), when compared with a degraded pasture system (124 t C ha -1 ). However, the teak plantation had decreased soil carbon stocks, relative to the degraded pasture. The analog forest had the best balance of both above-and below-ground carbon stored over the 17-year study period and provided a more diverse array of timber and non-timber forest products when compared with the teak plantation. This suggests that analog forestry could be a viable social-ecological approach to carbon storage and reforestation in the study region and other places with large areas of degraded pasture and a good understanding of the structure and function of the original vegetation.",

CO 2 contributions have been calculated at \u223c65 per cent among the major greenhouse gases (GHG), and its atmospheric concentration has increased from 280 ppm (parts per million), ca. 1750, to 379 ppm in 2004 (Epstein andRogers, 2004;NETL, 2004), with a record high value of 413 ppm recorded in 2020 (source: US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Research suggests land-use change is a major contributor to climate change (Pielke et al., 2002;Moore et al., 2012). A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Jia et al., 2019) asserts that Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) was responsible for \u223c23 per cent of the global contribution of greenhouse gases to climate change from 2007 to 2016. As landowners and policymakers worldwide consider the costs and benefits of various land-use practices, it is important that researchers provide specific information on the relationship between land-use change and its implications for terrestrial carbon storage, to offset emissions to the atmosphere. Forests are one of the main terrestrial sinks for CO 2 , and deforestation is a major contributor to climate change, among the various types of land-use change (Delpierre et al., 2012;Longobardi et al., 2016). From 2001 to 2018, there was a total of 361 million ha of tree cover lost globally, equivalent to a 9.0 per cent decrease in tree cover since 2000, and 98.7Gt of CO 2 emissions (Global Forest Watch, 2020), along with associated losses of biodiversity. Ecuador, for example, has an annual emission of GHG of \u223c80 million tons of carbon, mainly due to deforestation (MAE, 2016).",
        "2550641f-b204-4081-b1a2-606b0b1f08d5": "One of the primary drivers of this deforestation has been the expansion of land used for livestock grazing and agriculture (Szott et al., 2000;FAO, 2001). There are other important factors (Geist and Lambin, 2001), including poverty which sometimes drives the choice to clear forest for other land uses (Gibbon et al., 2005). For example, H\u00fcbler (2017) reported that tropical deforestation can result from local use of wood for cooking fires, housebuilding or generating income, but also noted that 'poverty' is likely a proxy for other factors like education level and social status, which The carbon sequestration potential of 'analog' forestry in Ecuador affect decisions that lead to deforestation. Worldwide, forests are shrinking into fragments embedded in complex landscape mosaics, where forested land uses are appurtenant to other, apparently more-valued, ones (Ellis and Ramankutty, 2008). This means that tree planting and other reforestation efforts will largely need to balance their social and environmental benefits with economic opportunity. A major environmental benefit of planting trees and restoring forests/tree cover is capturing carbon and reducing the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere (D\u00edaz-Franco et al., 2007;FAO, 2014;Lewis et al., 2019). The level of carbon fixation depends on the species composition, age and density of trees (Schulze et al., 2000). The overwhelming trend for afforestation projects (converting non-forested land to forest) has been to plant monocultures of commercially valuable trees (Pawson et al., 2013). While forest plantation monocultures can provide significant economic benefit and carbon storage benefits, forest plantings that are more diverse in species and function should (1) produce a greater diversity of ecosystem services, (2) be more resilient to changes in the environment, (3) be more robust to changes in market demands and (4) better alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods (Sunderlin et al., 2008;Verheyen et al., 2016).",
        "88f76812-09af-4ef1-84c7-1abc33ab1b8d": "It is particularly important to better understand the fate of carbon in the soil under different reforestation scenarios, because there is much less information on carbon stored below-ground and soil quality is part of the natural wealth of landowners. In a recent review, Wiesmeier et al. (2019) noted that storing organic carbon is a key function of soils, not only affecting climate, but a major determinate of soil function. Research suggests a high degree of variation in soil carbon storage following different landuse changes to and from forested land uses (Deng et al., 2016;Wiesmeier et al., 2019). Below-ground forest carbon stocks have high degrees of uncertainty associated with them (Metsaranta et al., 2017), especially due to greater limitations on below-vs above-ground data (Adame et al., 2017). So, clearly more studies of below-ground carbon are needed. One alternative approach to the typical scheme of plantation forestry has been called 'analog' forestry (AF), a term coined by Senanayake (1987) to describe a planted, treed, perennial polyculture system, with productive and marketable species, which is analogous in structure and ecological function to the original forest vegetation of the region where they are planted. AF mimics tropical forest structure, by planting multiple canopy layers of different tree and shrub species (Senanayake and Jack, 1998a,b) to enhance biodiversity (Liyanage et al., 2009), but is also designed to strengthen rural communities, both socially and economically, through the purposeful utilization of multiple species that provide commercial products (RIFA, 2007(RIFA, , 2008;;Shanley et al., 2008;Senanayake, 2012). AF does not use chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides or heavy machinery, seeking to create fertility analogous to the way that organic matter accumulates during forest succession (Recanati et al., 2016).",

AF could promote the recovery of degraded areas (vegetation and/or soil) and restore biodiversity while increasing the diversity of income sources to landowners, including the possible marketing of ecosystem services, such as sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 (Landry and Dowbiggin, 2010). Although the capacity of many forests and agroforestry systems to store carbon has been studied, more information is needed to specifically understand the carbon sequestration potential of AF systems, as compared to different land-use alternatives. In this article, we present the results of a study to estimate carbon sequestration levels, above-and below-ground, from an experimental AF system and two other land-use systems, (1) a pasture system and (2) a teak tree (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantation, common in the Cumand\u00e1 Canton, Ecuador.

Reforestation is a widely used strategy for restoration, which generally considers only the survival and growth as part of its monitoring. Therefore, the objective of this study was evaluating the effect of Pinus greggii introduction in the structure, biomass and the understory species diversity. Three reforested sites were selected -of 5, 12 and 14 years old-, a reference site (dominated by Pinus cembroides) and a degraded site (dominated by grasses). We established eight circular 400 m 2 , 100 m 2 and 1 m 2 plots (nested) to measure diameter, height of tree canopy, shrubs and herbaceous richness and diversity in the understory. Allometric equations were used to calculate aerial biomass. Alpha and beta diversity of the understory was determined. The highest biomass accumulation was found in the reference site (25.27 Mg ha -1 ), followed by the older reforestation (R14) with 14.16 Mg ha -1 . These had higher species richness and diversity likewise. The Jaccard index showed larger similarity between the degraded site and the five year-old reforestation (61 %). It was found that R14 achieved accumulation of biomass, species richness and diversity similar to those from the reference site.",

Its plantation area covers more than 7x10 6 hm 2 , accounting for 24% of the total area of plantation forests in the country. In recent decades, the system of successive plantation of Chinese fir has been widely used in southern China due to anticipated high economic return. However, recent studies have documented that the practice of this system has led to dramatic decreases in soil fertility and forest environment as well as in productivity.Some forest ecologists and managers recognize the ecological role performed by broadleaf trees growing in mixtures with conifers, and a great deal of studies on mixture effects have been conducted, particularly on mixture species of temperate and boreal forests, but these research results were not completely consistent. Possibilities include dependence of the mixture effects in large part to specific site conditions, the interactions among species in mixtures and biological characteristics of species. Although some researchers also studied the effects of mixtures of Chinese fir and broadleaf tree species on soil fertility, forest environment and tree growth status, little information is available about the effects of Chinese fir and its mixtures with broadleaves on carbon and nitrogen stocks.The experimental site is situated at the Huitong Experimental Station of Forest Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hunan Province (26\u00b040p-27\u00b009p N, 109\u00b026p-110\u00b008p E).It is located at the transition zone from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the low mountains and hills of the southern bank of the Yangtze River at an altitude of 300-1,100 m above mean sea level.

A comparative study on C and N stocks under these three plantation forest ecosystems was conducted in 2004. Results showed that carbon stocks were greater under the mixtures than under the pure Chinese fir forest and the pure broad-leaved forest, and the broadleaves and the mixtures showed higher values in nitrogen stocks compared with the pure Chinese fir forest. The spatial distribution of carbon and nitrogen stocks was basically consistent, the value being greater in soil layer, followed by tree layer, roots, understory and litter layer. The carbon and nitrogen stocks in soil layer were both highly correlated with the biomass in understory and litter layer, indicating that understory and forest litterfall exerted a profound effect on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks under plantation ecosystems. However, correlations among soil carbon, nitrogen stocks and below ground biomass of stand have not been observed in this study.",

Forest plants absorb and transform CO 2 in the air into organic matter and fix them in plants; on the other hand, CO 2 is released to the air through the respiration of plants, animals and microbes as well as the decomposition of litter. It is referred to as carbon sink in the former case and carbon source in the latter. In other words, the carbon balance of a forest ecosystem is determined by the processes of carbon input and output, and their difference is called the net ecosystem production (NEP). A positive NEP value indicates that the ecosystem features a CO 2 sink, and conversely, a negative NEP value suggests a CO 2 source. A great number of studies worldwide have been reported on carbon storage and stock potential in forest ecosystems, yet most focused on natural forests (Chen et al., 2000, Fang et al., 2004), and few researches on plantations are documented. So far, such studies on Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations are especially rarely reported except for those by Chen et al. (2000), Fang et al. (2002Fang et al. ( , 2004) ) and He et al. (2003), and literature on the comparison of continuously planted pure Chinese fir plantation, Chinese fir-broadleaf mixture and pure broad-leaved plantation were never found. This study investigated carbon storage in the three forest ecosystems mentioned above to provide a scientific basis for sustainable productivity of Chinese fir plantations. At the same time, this study also attempts to offer fundamental information for the estimation of C balance in China's forest ecosystems, and further giving some theoretical basis for the government in planning forestry development and environmental protection. Nitrogen is one of the most abundant elements in ecosystems, and is also an element inhibited during the primary production of most terrestrial ecosystems (Vitousek et al., 1979;Mooney et al., 1987;Vitousek and Howarth, 1991;Han et al., 1999;He et al., 2003).",

As a macroelement, nitrogen plays a key role in the substance cycling of forest ecosystems.

Plantations established in subtropical China since the 1980s, mainly of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) in monocultures, have proved to be major C sinks. However, information is lacking about whether mixing Chinese fir with broadleaved tree species will increase stand growth and C sequestration. We address this question by comparing a pure Chinese fir plantation and two mixed plantations established in 1990 at Huitong Experimental Station of Forest Ecology, Hunan Province, China. The mixed plantations include Chinese fir and either Kalopanax septemlobus (Thunb.) Koidz or Alnus cremastogyne Burk., planted at 4:1 ratios.

The mixed plantation with A. cremastogyne increased C storage in biomass relative to the pure Chinese fir plantation (P < 0.05). No significant difference was detected between mixed plantations. Soil C storage did not differ among these plantations, ranging from 67.9 AE 7.1 to 73.3 AE 9.1 Mg ha \u00c01 , which accounted for about 55% of the total C pools.

Forests play a significant role in this carbon (C) sink. It has been reported that forests store about 45% of terrestrial C, more than double the amount of C in the atmosphere (FAO, 2006). In China, terrestrial ecosystems absorbed 0.19-0.26 Pg C per year, 28-37% of its cumulative fossil C emissions, during the 1980s and 1990s (Piao et al., 2009). Forests in southern China, mainly as part of a large-scale plantation program initiated in the 1980s, contributed about 65% of the C sink in southern China terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, forest ecosystems influence significantly the global C cycle; even a small shift in the balance between photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration can lead to a large change in uptake or emission of CO 2 from forests to the atmosphere. Thus, enhancing C storage in forest ecosystems will be a key factor in the maintenance of the atmosphere's C balance. Globally, many attempts have been made to estimate C storage in forest ecosystems because sequestering C in biomass and soil is widely believed to be an effective method to mitigate an increase of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Davis et al., 2003;Hazlett et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2007;Zhou et al., 2008). For example, Davis et al. (2003) reported that C storage in 125-year-old pole stands was 219 Mg ha \u00c01 and declined to 192 Mg ha \u00c01 as the stands matured (>150 years old). Zhou et al.

Its planting area has reached over 12 million ha, accounting for about 6.5% of all plantation forests in the world (FAO, 2006;West, 2006). Therefore, Chinese fir forests should play a significant role in global C sequestration. Since the 1980s, it has been recognized that yield and soil fertility of pure Chinese fir stands tends to decline due to successive cropping, short rotation times of about 20 years, and whole-tree harvesting (Chen et al., 1990). Fortunately, some studies have showed that planting mixed forest of Chinese fir and broadleaved tree species could increase productivity and improve soil fertility (Feng et al., 1988;Chen et al., 1990). To date, however, little information is available about the impacts of mixed plantations on C storage in Chinese fir mixed forest ecosystems. In this study, we measured and compared total ecosystem C among one pure Chinese fir plantation (PC) and two mixed plantations with Chinese fir and either Kalopanax septemlobus (MCK) or Alnus cremastogyne (MCA).

In this study, Yangjuangou watershed was selected to investigate the SOC distribution under different land uses. We found that SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth under all land uses and was significantly different across the vertical soil profile (P b 0.01). However, considering effect of land use on SOC, it is only significant (P b 0.01) in the topsoil (0-5 cm) layer. This indicated that land use has a large effect on the stocks of SOC in the surface soil. The stratification ratio of SOC N 1.2 may mean that soil quality is improving. The order of the SOC density (0-30 cm) under different land uses is forestland N orchard land N grassland N immature forestland N terraced cropland. The SOC stock is found to be as large as 2.67 \u00d7 10 3 t (0-30 cm) in this watershed.

Thus one of the key components for assessing soil quality is SOC appraisal (Gregorich et al., 1994;Lal, 2004). On the other hand, with an increasing concern about the increase of atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the role of SOC in carbon sequestration, field experiments carried out on different land uses are widely employed to develop options for increasing soil carbon sequestration (Follett, 2001). SOC stock in surface soils worldwide has been estimated to around 2011 Pg (2.011 \u00d7 10 18 g) C, twice the value in either living vegetation or atmospheric carbon (IPCC, 2000). As one of the most important carbon stocks, SOC has large potential to affect global climate (IPCC, 2000;Pan et al., 2003). Measuring the quantity and spatial distribution of SOC is essential for evaluating soil function and understanding soil carbon sequestration processes (Venteris et al., 2004). A series of studies to estimate the soil carbon stock and distribution patterns at the global, continental, country and regional scales have been conducted and reported. However, due to varied data sources, a lack of complete inventory data, and the inherent spatial variability of SOC, estimation of SOC stock at large scale has varied from one study to another (Xie et al., 2004). For example, Bohn (1976) estimated a figure of 3000 Pg for global SOC storage, whereas Bolin (1977) estimated a figure of 710 Pg. There is similar uncertainty for SOC estimates in China. Fang et al. (1996) estimated the SOC storage in China at 185.7 Pg, while Pan et al. (2002) estimated SOC storage at a significantly lower figure of only 50 Pg.",

Therefore, the selection of the type of SOC database, the land use and/or soil map, the mapping resolution, reference depth, bulk density or other information can have a great influence on the final SOC stock estimation. To reduce the uncertainty of SOC stock estimation, site and local scale monitoring and assessments are necessary. Arid and semi-arid regions have been regarded as potential carbon sinks recently (Squires, 1998;Lal, 2002;Ard\u00f6 and Olsson, 2003;Gr\u00fcnzweig et al., 2003). The Loess Plateau, the important cradle of traditional Chinese culture, is typically semi-arid and famous for its deep loess. However, during its history frequent and long-term anthropogenic activities have caused negative impacts on local environments, namely severe degradation of natural vegetation and serious soil erosion (Peng and Yu, 1995;Shi and Shao, 2000). The amount of annual soil erosion is estimated to be over 2.2 Pg (National Environmental Protection Bureau, 2000). A large quantity of fine surface soil that has eroded from the loess area is transported into the Yellow River, which has been described as the most turbid river in the world, with some 1.6 Pg of sediment being transported each year and a sediment concentration of 35 kg m -3 (Zhang, 2005). These have resulted in a fragile environmental status within the Loess Plateau and have become the main source of sediment in the Yellow River (Zhu, 1999). Due to natural drought conditions, intensive human disturbance and severe erosion, the Loess Plateau has become the lowest in soil carbon pool in China (Li et al., 2004).

The objectives are: (1) to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution; (2) to assess the degree of soil quality improvement under the current naturally rehabilitated states by stratification ratio of SOC; and (3) to estimate SOC density of a small watershed in Loess Plateau.",

Increasing the SOC content means increasing the carbon input. Switching from conventional agriculture to other land uses with higher carbon inputs or reduced disturbance (e.g., conversion to grassland, natural regeneration) will increase soil carbon stocks. To a certain extent, increased SOC can result in decreasing atmospheric CO 2 level and mitigating global warming. However, different land use or vegetation cover has different potential to increase SOC. In this study, forest plantation with an age of 25 yr accumulated the highest level of SOC among all land-use types. Seven-yr-old, naturally rehabilitated grassland dominated by local herbaceous species, however, reached a SOC level almost similar to that of forestland. This indicated that natural vegetation restoration   has great potential for improving soil quality due to increasing surface SOC. This was due to the high residue input in the surface soil (Li et al., 1992;Wu et al., 2004;Liu et al., 2005). The topsoil (0-5 cm) layers of all the land-use types were significantly different on SOC, which indicated that the topsoil was very important for SOC accumulation. At the same time, the effects of land use on soil carbon sequestration occur mainly in the topsoil layer. Factors including vegetation coverage, the amount of liter fall and root impact, and disturbance or management regime can contribute to the significant variation of surface soil SOC across different land uses (Franzluebbers et al., 1998;McCarty et al., 1998;Pascual et al., 2000;Degryze et al., 2004;Chen et al., 2007a,b). Accordingly, the large and rapid changes in the SOC density after land-use conversion indicated that there is considerable potential to enhance soil carbon sequestration in the loess hilly area of China. This can result in improving topsoil quality and increasing SOC storage.",

SOC stock, fine root biomass and root C/N ratio at the 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm depths were determined. The mean SOC stock of natural vegetation at the 0-100 cm depth was significantly greater than that of artificial vegetation, with an increase of 100% for woodland, 15% for shrubland, and 23% for grassland. Natural vegetation restoration led to a significantly greater SOC stock up to a depth of 100 cm for woodland, 40 cm for shrubland, and 40 cm for grassland. The fine root biomass of natural vegetation at the 0-100 cm depth was also significantly greater than that of artificial vegetation, with an increase of 170% for woodland, 140% for shrubland, and 20% for grassland. Natural vegetation restoration led to a significantly greater fine root biomass up to a depth of 100 cm for woodland, 60 cm for shrubland, and only 20 cm for grassland. There was a significant linear correlation between SOC stock and fine root biomass. Thus, natural vegetation restoration could lead to a significantly greater SOC stock, fine root biomass, and fine root C/N ratio than the artificial vegetation restoration. Fine root was an important factor influencing the differences in the SOC stock between artificial and natural vegetation.",

Vegetation restoration from cropland into woodland, shrubland, and grassland has been recognized as an effective strategy for SOC stock and distribution (B\u00e1rcena et al., 2014;Deng et al., 2014;Zhu et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2014). However, natural vegetation restoration is distinctly different from the artificial approach in terms of management (Del Galdo et al., 2003;Six et al., 2000), microclimate (temperature and moisture) (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010), species composition (Shi et al., 2013), soil properties (Xu et al., 2014), and fine root quantity and quality (Solly et al., 2014), thus resulting in significantly different SOC stock and distribution (Jin et al., 2014). This highlights the need for a better understanding of the effects of artificial and natural vegetation restoration on the SOC stock and distribution, which is helpful for the selection of appropriate restoration measures. The Loess Plateau that covers an area of approximately 58 \u00c2 10 4 km 2 in China is known for its long agricultural history and serious soil erosion. It is a long-term and arduous task to control soil erosion and establish a healthy ecosystem. Since the establishment of China, great importance has been attached to the restoration of vegetation in this region (Zhou et al., 2012), and artificial vegetation restoration, such as afforestation and plantation of grasses and shrubs (Yang et al., 2014), and natural vegetation restoration (Li and Shao, 2006;Zhu et al., 2010) have been conducted in this region.",

Guo and Gifford (2002) showed that the conversion of cropland to native and artificial woodland resulted in an increase of SOC by 53% and 18% about 50 years, respectively. In addition, natural vegetation had a greater litter productivity all the year round and better SOC sequestration than artificial vegetation (Jin et al., 2014;Wei et al., 2012). However, some others argued that artificial vegetation had a greater C sequestration capacity due to superior growth rate and stand structure (Gong et al., 2006;Jia et al., 2012). Vesterdal et al. (2002) found the redistribution of SOC along the soil profile rather than an obvious increase after 30 years of forestation. However, factors contributing to these conflicting results are largely understudied, and thus further investigations on the effect of artificial and native vegetation on SOC sequestration are warranted. Fine root quantity and quality have a profound and lasting effect on the dynamics and distribution of SOC stock (Liao et al., 2014;Sucre and Fox, 2009;Wang et al., 2013;Jessy et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2015). However, it differs significantly among vegetation types. For instance, Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) has a higher fine root biomass than spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scotspine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Norway (Fin\u00e9r et al., 2007); deciduous tree has a higher fine root biomass than conifer tree in the temperate zone (Jackson et al., 1996;Vogt et al., 1986); and tree fine root biomass is higher in the temperate than in the boreal zone (Vogt et al., 1986(Vogt et al., , 1995;;Christoph and Hertel, 2003).",

The objectives of the present study were to determine (1) the stock and distribution of C in the 0-100 cm soil profile under artificial and natural vegetation; (2) the differences in fine root quantity and quality between artificial and natural vegetation; and (3) the relationship between SOC stock and fine root biomass in the Loess Plateau, China.",

This study examined the changes of carbon stocks in mineral soil (0-100 cm), plant biomass and the ecosystem (plant and soil) following vegetation restoration with different models and ages. Our results indicated that cultivated land returned to native vegetation (natural restoration) or artificial forest increased ecosystem carbon sequestration. Tree plantation sequestered more carbon than natural vegetation succession over decades scale due to the rapid increase in biomass carbon pool. Restoration ages had different effects on the dynamics of biomass and soil carbon stocks. Biomass carbon stocks increased with vegetation restoration age, while the dynamics of soil carbon stocks were affected by sampling depth. Ecosystem carbon stocks consistently increased after tree plantation regardless of the soil depth; but an initial decrease and then increase trend was observed in natural restoration chronosequences with the soil sampling depth of 0-100 cm. Moreover, there was a time lag of about 15-30 years between biomass production and soil carbon sequestration in 0-100 cm, which indicated a long-term effect of vegetation restoration on deeper soil carbon sequestration.",

However, during this process we learned that a software platform is necessary to automate the selection process because it can flexible to assist users. Here, we developed a generalized software platform called the \"Restoration Plant Species Selection (RPSS) Platform.\" This flexible software is designed to assist users in selecting plant species for particular purposes (e.g., restore the degraded ecosystems and others). It is written in R language and integrated with external R packages, including the packages that computing similarity indexes, providing graphic outputs, and offering web functions. The software has a web-based graphical user interface that allows users to execute required functions via checkboxes and buttons. The platform has crossplatform functionality, which means that it can run on all common operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, and others). We also illustrate a successful case study in which the software platform was used to select suitable plant species for restoration purpose. The objective of this paper is to introduce the newly developed software platform RPSS and to provide useful guidances on using it for various applications.

These degraded ecosystems are known to seriously affect human economic and social life (Laughlin and Laughlin, 2013;Laughlin, 2014). As such, ecological restoration has rapidly developed to solve the urgent and complex degraded problems (Brown and Amacher, 1999;Cardinale et al., 2012). Among all, identifying the suitable species that can successfully restore the degraded ecosystems is the primary challenge in restoration science (Fry et al., 2013). However, this step requires a comprehensive understanding of the ecological restoration theory, including information on species interactions, successional processes, and resource-use patterns. Because these processes differ greatly across different ecosystems, it remains an enormous challenge. As this type of information is typically lacking, the selection of candidate species for restoration purposes are typically chosen using traditional trial-and-error method. Nevertheless, the trial-and-error method based largely on expert knowledge of the ecosystem (Rosenthal, 2003), and such information requires the involvement of a restoration practitioner who has a wealth of practical experience which is based on years of training (Padilla et al., 2009;Ostertag et al., 2015). Plant functional traits (including morphological, physiological and phenological characteristics that are linked to plant life history strategies) are fundamental to understanding plant adaptations and distributions. In theory, plant functional traits can be useful for selecting suitable species to restore degraded ecosystems by computing the similarity index between the target species (e.g., species have been proved to have high survival rates in the degraded ecosystems) and the potential species (e.g., all possible suitable species) (Zhang et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2020). Several studies have successfully used functional traits to select suitable plant species for restoring degraded ecosystems (Bochet and Garc\u00eda-Fayos, 2015;Ostertag et al., 2015;Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2018;Werden et al., 2018;Rayome et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020).",

In a previous study (Wang et al., 2020), we developed a species screening model based on this quantitative trait-based theory (Shipley et al., 2006). Also, we successfully applied this model to select best fit plant species for restoring a tropical coral island which is part of Hainan Island, China (Wang et al., 2020).

We examined the dynamics of community structure and ecosystem carbon accumulation along a chronosequence of Sonneratia apetala plantations on Qi'ao Island, China. Methods To reveal the self-thinning pattern of S. apetala plantations, 114 quadrats were randomly established in the S. apetala plantations. Four quadrats were selected for soil sampling from differently-aged (4, 9, and 15 years) S. apetala plantations, a 15-year-old S. apetala + Bruguiera gymnorrhiza plantation and a 40-year-old mature Kandelia obovate community. Results We found that the self-thinning process happened in these S. apetala plantations. The vegetation biomass was found to significantly increase with forest age and the 15-year-old S. apetala and 15-year-old S. apetala + Bruguiera gymnorrhiza plantations had similar total biomass as the 40-year-old K. obovate community. Notably, SOC content and stocks only showed a minor increment along the chronosequence of S. apetala plantations, and SOC stock of the 15-yearold S. apetala community was less than 60% of that of the 40-year-old K. obovate community. The 15-year-old S. apetala + B. gymnorrhiza community had a similar biomass value as the 15-year-old S. apetala community, but the former community had a significant higher SOC stock than the latter. Conclusion Biomass increment and SOC accumulation are unsynchronized with mangrove plantation development, and monospecific mangrove plantations may not be able to significantly accelerate SOC sequestration in the early plantation stage. Multi-specific plantations may facilitate SOC accumulation more than monospecific plantations.",

They have high productivity and provide various ecological, economic and social services (Adame et al. 2013;Bouillon et al. 2008;Costanza et al. 2014;Donato et al. 2011;Wang et al., 2019a). Mangrove forests can maintain a carbon pool that is three times higher than those of typical upland forests (Adame et al. 2013;Donato et al. 2011). Mangrove forests only occupy 0.1% of the earth's continental surface, but they account for more than 15% of sedimentary coastal carbon storage, and 11% of total terrestrial carbon input in the coastal ocean (Giri et al. 2011;Jennerjahn and Ittekkot 2002;P\u00e9rez et al. 2017). Due to their highly efficient carbon sequestration capabilities, mangrove forests have been valued as crucial carbon reservoirs for mitigating global climate change (Arshad et al. 2018;Ha et al. 2018;Wang et al. 2013). Unfortunately, mangrove forest area has been declining at a rate of more than 1% per year for a long time, largely due to the conversion of mangrove forests for urban and industrial development, shrimp and fish aquaculture, rice cultivation, and oil palm plantations (Hapsari et al. 2020;Sharma et al. 2020). To increase mangrove forests and the associated carbon stock, several countries have committed to mangrove afforestation and reforestation as part of their international initiatives for mitigating global climate change during the last five decades (Arnaud et al. 2020;Herr et al. 2015;Lee et al. 2019). Recent studies have confirmed that ecosystem carbon cycles could be largely influenced by mangrove afforestation and reforestation (Hong Tinh et al. 2020;Sharma et al. 2020).",

Accurately estimating variations in carbon stock after mangrove afforestation and reforestation is necessary to improve our ability to predict global carbon budgets and how they impact climate change. The community structure of mangrove forests has important effects on carbon cycle processes (Ray et al. 2011;Sanders et al. 2016;Twilley and Rivera-Monroy 2009;Wang et al., 2019b), because autochthonous carbon inputs contribute a large portion to mangrove carbon stocks and sinks (Iimura et al. 2019;Lamont et al. 2020;Marchand 2017;Saintilan et al. 2013). In the natural and densely planted mangrove forests of Xuan Thuy National Park, Vietnam, autochthonous carbon inputs accounted more than 80% of SOC (Tue et al. 2012). Xiong et al. (2018) found autochthonous carbon inputs accounted for more than 60% of mangrove SOC increment compared to mudflats. Many researchers reported that biomass and SOC stocks significantly varied among different mangrove communities (Eid et al. 2020;Wang et al. 2013;Wang et al., 2019a;Xin et al. 2018). The results of recent studies demonstrated that SOC stocks remarkably increased along with rapid biomass increment after mangrove afforestation and reforestation (Lunstrum and Chen 2014;Ren et al. 2010;Salmo et al. 2013). The results of previous studies indicated that variations in SOC stocks were related to tree density, aerial root density, species diversity, vegetation cover, and basal area (Gillis et al. 2017;Lamont et al. 2020;Mackenzie et al. 2016;Marchio et al. 2016;Mizanur Rahman et al. 2015).",

Self-thinning (i.e., the decrease in tree density as the average tree size and biomass increase) is among the most important processes that affect community structure dynamics in the development of mangrove forests. With increasing competition for limited resources such as fresh water, nutrients and light, self-thinning processes naturally occur across different natural and human-made forest ecosystems (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2016;Kamara et al. 2014;Liu et al. 2016;Ma et al. 2019). The relationship between tree density (D) and average biomass per tree (W) has been defined as the \"self-thinning rule,\" which was formulated by Yoda et al. (1963), and this relationship can be determined by the power function equation, viz.W = kD -a , where a is the self-thinning exponent and K is a multiplying factor. Although the selfthinning processes have been studied in natural mangrove forests (e.g., Analuddin et al. 2009;Deshar et al. 2012;Kamara et al. 2014), studies of these ecological processes in planted mangrove forests remain limited (Pranchai 2017). Moreover, little attention has been paid to the interactions between community structures and carbon cycles along with the mangrove selfthinning processes. In China, mangrove forest area was estimated to be at about 42,000 ha in 1950s (Liao and Zhang 2014). However, the mangrove forest area dropped sharply in the last century to 17, 811 ha in1990s due to urban development and the massive land reclamation for shrimp and fish aquaculture, and rice cultivation (Li and Lee 1997). More than 50% of mangrove forests have been lost, which is an alarming problem concerning ecological protection and development. Since the Chinese government gradually recognized the important ecological, economic and social values of mangrove forests in the 1990s, an increasing number of mangrove forests have been planted in the pantropical zones along Chinese coastlines.",

In addition, biomass increment continued when the forest age was more than 15 years (Fig. 5c). These results indicated that S. apetala plantations have high biomass accumulation potentials because of their fast growth rate with high adaptability in poor habitats, even when fertilization is not used. It is noteworthy that AGB and BGB were found to be positively related to tree density along with tree height and DBH (Tables 1 and2), which partially indicated that biomass increment can be strengthened through a higher seedling density at the early plantation stage. From the compiled data, we also found that the ratios of SOC contents in S. apetala to that of bare mudflats increased with forest age (Fig. 5d). However, the SOC accumulation rate was much lower than the biomass accumulation rate in these S. apetala plantations.

The large difference in SOC accumulation values between these recent studies and our research could be attributed to the differing geological settings in these studies. These recent studies of the mangrove plantations were carried out in Shenzhen Bay, Leizhou Bay, and Jiulong River Estuary, which neighbor the mainland area. In contrast, Qi'ao Island (the study area in this study) is far away from the mainland area. Therefore, it can be predicted that more abundant inputs of organic materials would be deposited through landward surface runoff in the mangrove plantations neighboring the mainland area than those on Qi'ao Island.

Our results confirmed that the self-thinning processes also happened in S. apetala plantations (Fig. 3). The self-thinning processes were mainly caused by the growth competition among neighboring individuals and the density-dependent mortality (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2016;Deshar et al. 2012;Kamara et al. 2014). Yoda et al. (1963) predicted the self-thinning exponent to be 3/2 based on a simple geometric model while Enquist et al.

The results of many previous studies have confirmed this self-thinning phenomenon, which is called the 3/2 or 4/3 self-thinning rule, in different forest ecosystems, including the overcrowded mangrove forests (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2016;Deshar et al. 2012;Inoue and Nishizono 2015;Kamara et al. 2014;Li et al. 2013;Wang et al., 2019b;Zhang et al. 2017). Nevertheless, the universality of the 3/2 or 4/3 self-thinning rule is continuously debated. It is well known that the theoretical 3/2 or 4/3 self-thinning rule was predicted based on the different ideal assumptions. In fact, self-thinning processes are inevitably affected by many factors such as species, plant characteristics, soil nutrient conditions, stand histories and site indexes, and they are directly influenced by abiotic factors such as climatic conditions and water and nutrient availability (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2016;Liu et al. 2016;Xue et al.",

Some recent research results demonstrated that the selfthinning exponents of different upland forests could be significantly higher (or lower) than 3/2 or 4/3 (Lie and Xue 2019;Liu et al. 2016;Xue et al. 2015;Zhang et al. 2016). As shown in Fig. 3, the self-thinning exponents for both AGB and BGB across the S. apetala mangrove forest were 0.4668 and 0.4947, and they were significantly lower than the theoretical self-thinning exponent value. Moreover, the self-thinning exponents for DBH and tree height were only 0.2882 and 0.1850, respectively. These results reconfirm that the self-thinning exponent could vary more than the theoretical values. Firstly, a possible explanation for the significant differences in self-thinning exponents between the S. apetala mangrove forests (Fig. 3) and other native mangrove forests (Analuddin et al. 2009;Deshar et al. 2012;Kamara et al. 2014;Wang et al., 2019b) is that the S. apetala plantations usually have a lower survival rate. Zan et al. (2001) demonstrated that the survival rate of both the 6 and 7-year-old S. apetala plantations was about 55% in the Futian Natural Reserve of Shenzhen, South China. Lin et al. (2014) even reported that the S. apetala plantations had a much lower survival rate of 25% 14 months after being planted in the sandy beach of Eastern Guangdong Province, South China.",
        "621993c5-4a79-4355-8211-c772fe1b2700": "In addition, because the introduced S. apetala had much lower cold resistance in comparison with native mangrove species, the S. apetala plantations could be easily affected by the extreme cold in south China (Chen et al. 2010). The extreme cold event in early 2008 killed many S. apetala seedlings and trees and caused immature flowers and fruits to drop from trees (Chen et al. 2010). The S. apetala trees planted in the period between 2006 and 2007 were almost dead because of the effects of the extreme cold in 2008. Extreme cold events usually have a stronger effect on young plantations than old ones. As shown in Fig. 6, the average temperatures for February in 1996 and 2008 were much lower than the historical average temperature since the 1990s, and the average January temperatures in 1996 and 2011 were much lower than the historical average temperature. Obviously, these effects of extreme cold events on mangrove growth cannot be neglected. Furthermore, S. apetala plantations usually have a lower initial tree density and vegetation cover than natural mangrove forests (Wang et al., 2019a). S. apetala plantations on Qi'ao Island often have an initial tree density of about 5, 000 trees ha -1 , while natural mangrove forests have tree densities of more than 10, 000 trees ha -1 (Wang et al., 2019b). Due to their low survival rate and initial planting densities, some of the studied S. apetala plantations might not be fully stocked. Growing space competition, a main cause of natural thinning, might not occur in stands that are not fully stocked, especially in the early plantation stage. Thus, S. apetala plantations have a significantly lower self-thinning exponents than other forests. Besides, different mangrove species have different growth strategies and thus, they have different plant shape mass density values (mass per unit of occupied space). The result of previous studies indicated that the thinning exponent could differ as a function of plant shape and mass density.",
        "c23aee73-3087-48fe-8229-7559fcb64ab4": "As a result, S. apetala plantations have a unique self-thinning process. At the same time, for the above-mentioned reasons (i.e., the low survival rate, low initial planting density, and low growing space competition), tree density may not always decreased with forest age. Our correlation analysis results confirmed that forest age was not significantly related to tree density, even though forest age is negatively related to tree height and DBH (Table As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4, S. apetala plantation SOC content and stock slightly increased with forest age while tree height, AGB, and BGB values increased with decreasing tree density. In other words, SOC storage could be strengthened by mangrove growth along with the self-thinning process. The result of many recent studies on mangrove plantations align with this result, and their authors reported that SOC content/stock increased with vegetation biomass as forest age increased (Chen et al. 2018;Lunstrum and Chen 2014;Ren et al. 2010). Some stable isotope analysis indicated that mangrove-derived carbon plays an important role in SOC increment primarily through in situ inputs (Chen et al. 2018;Tue et al. 2012;Tue et al. 2018;Xiong et al. 2018). The biomass increment after mangrove plantations carried out would be benefitted to increase mangrove-derived carbon (e.g., root exudate, dead root and vegetation litter) inputs into the soils (Wang et al., 2019a). Because high AGB and BGB values are usually indicative of a high forest age in these mangrove plantations, SOC accumulation history is much longer in mangrove plantations with high AGB and BGB values. Along with forest age, Chen et al. ( 2018) reported that SOC accumulation could be mainly controlled by mangrove-derived carbon inputs.",

The SOC stocks of the 15-SA + BG and 15-SA communities were 12.51% and 48.91% higher than that of the mudflat (Fig. 4). These results suggest that multi-specific mangrove plantations could be more beneficial to SOC accumulation than monospecific mangrove plantations. A similar result was reported by Chen et al. (2012), who found that SOC accumulation was higher in a multi-specific plantation (50% S. caseolaris; 50% S. apetala) than in the monospecific plantation, even though biomass increment was lower in a multi-specific plantation. The higher SOC in the 15-SA + BG community than the 15-SA community may be due to two reasons. Firstly, a high tree density can effectively slow water flow, increase sedimentation rates, and further facilitate carbon deposition (Chen et al. 2012;Wang et al., 2019b;Wu et al. 2020). As shown in Table 3, there was obviously higher tree density in the 15-SA + BG community (1518 trees ha -1 , including canopy tree density and understory tree density) than in the 15-SA community (1150 trees ha -1 ). Some recent studies have revealed that tree density is positively correlated to SOC stock and the SOC sequestration rate (Gillis et al. 2017;Mackenzie et al. 2016). Secondly, as an important part of belowground carbon, BGB varied among different mangrove plantations (Fig. 4).",

Gleason and Ewel (2002) found that standing living root biomass was positively related to soil carbon concentration. Some research results underlined that SOC distribution is controlled by the distribution of fine root biomass (Ha et al. 2018;He et al. 2018). Generally, a high BGB value effectively facilitates inputs of mangrove-derived organic materials (like root exudate and dead roots) and further increases SOC stock and accumulation. Recently, multi-specific mangrove plantations have been recommended to increase ecological service and biodiversity (Alongi 2011). Expectedly, Mackenzie et al. (2016) reported that the mangrove sediment rate is positively related to biodiversity in Palau and Vietnam. In summary, these above-mentioned study results supported the fact that multi-specific mangrove plantations have higher SOC accumulation values than monospecific mangrove plantations.",

Our findings provide new evidence on the divergent responses of biomass and soil to carbon sequestration after reforestation with respect to stand ages and vegetation types.

Atmospheric carbon is stored in wood, leaves and soil (Justine et al. 2015). Therefore, newly planted and naturally regenerated forests increase the storage of biomass carbon and soil carbon (Canadell and Raupach 2008). In carbon cycle studies, biomass carbon is an important indicator of vegetation growth and amount (Houghton et al. 2009). Trees, shrubs and herbs in forests provide primary carbon sequestration (Thomas and Martin 2012). Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics also play an important role in carbon cycles because small changes in SOC stock significantly influences atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (Stockmann et al. 2013). CO 2 is removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil, Abstract The effect of reforestation on carbon sequestration has been extensively studied but there is less understanding of the changes that stand age and vegetation types have on changes in biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC) after reforestation. In this study, 150 reforested plots were sampled across six provinces and one municipality in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during 2017 and 2018 to estimate carbon storage in biomass and soil. The results illustrate that site-averaged SOC was greater than site-averaged biomass carbon. There was more carbon sequestered in the biomass than in the soil. Biomass carbon accumulated thereby improving soil properties and decreasing soil erosion (Kimble et al. 2007). Carbon sequestered in biomass and soil varies by age of stands, plant types and environmental conditions (Laganiere et al. 2010;Zhao et al. 2014;Xu et al. 2018). Stand age influences the rate of carbon sequestration (Guo and Ren 2014), while the relationship between age and carbon stocks in biomass and soil is not necessarily linear.",

Reforestation of degraded croplands and barren lands has been proposed as an effective means for sequestering and accumulating carbon (Houghton and Hackler 1999;Foley et al. 2005). Over the last four decades, China has implemented several national forest conservation and restoration projects which have significantly increased the carbon pools of forest ecosystems (Tang et al. 2018). Between the 1970s and the 2000s in China, biomass carbon stock increased by 40%, with soils storing more carbon than plant biomass (Sundquist 1993;Lu et al. 2018). Forest conservation and reforestation projects have included the Natural Forest Protection Program (since 1999), the ''Grain for Green'' (GfG) program (since 1999) and the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (since 1978) (Delang and Yuan 2016; Fang et al. 2018). Due to its steep lands, serious soil erosion problems, and high sediment yields, the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) has been the main area for the implementation of the ''Grain for Green'' (Delang 2019). With the GfG, people plant both 'ecological species' (from which income can only be obtained from pruning and logging) and 'economic species' (species from which income can be obtained from the sale of fruits), while rules stipulate that at least 80% of the species have to be ecological. A better comprehension of carbon sequestration in economic trees versus ecological trees in reforested lands improves evaluation of the reforestation programs. Carbon dynamics after reforestation in the YRB is poorly understood. Previous studies focused on estimating SOC or biomass carbon pools separately (Wang et al. 2013;Kong et al. 2020).",

Because of the scarcity of soil or biomass carbon measurements, carbon storage and sequestration were typically estimated using a fixed ratio between biomass and soil carbon (Shvidenko and Nilsson 2003;Pan et al. 2011). Some studies suggest that carbon biomass/SOC ratios may lead to large uncertainties in carbon storage estimations because carbon in biomass and soil can differ considerably across ecosystems and climates (Piao et al. 2009;Hong et al. 2020). For example, in tropical forests 56% of carbon is stored in the biomass and 32% in the soil, while in boreal forests only 20% of carbon is in the biomass and 60% in the soil (Pan et al. 2011). In Chinese terrestrial ecosystems during the 1980s and 1990s, 58% of carbon sequestration occurred in the biomass and the remainder in soil organic matter (Piao et al. 2009). In addition, from 1982 to the mid-2000s, forests accumulated more biomass carbon (1.65 Pg C) while the largest soil carbon sink was in shrublands (0.039 Pg C a -1 ) with far less soil carbon in forests (0.004 Pg C a -1 ) (Fang et al. 2007;Piao et al. 2009). However, how the carbon in biomass and SOC changes by stand age and vegetation type after reforestation in the YRB is poorly understood. This study explores the differences between biomass and soil carbon sequestration after reforestation with different stand ages and vegetation types in the YRB ecosystem. The major objectives are: (1) to estimate carbon storage and carbon sequestration in aboveground biomass, undergrowth biomass, belowground biomass and SOC in evergreen ecological forests, deciduous ecological forests and agricultural lands; and, (2) to explore relationships between carbon sequestration by age of stands, vegetation type and environmental conditions.",

Hence, the optimal tree species richness required to increase SOC stocks needs to be further explored. Based on field observations from a subtropical mixed-species planted forest, which was established 40 years ago through a mosaic pattern of afforestation and natural regeneration, we examined the effects of tree species richness on the SOC stock and the chemical composition of SOC in the topsoil (top 10 cm layer). We found a quadratic relationship between tree species richness and SOC stocks. The threshold of tree species richness appeared between four and five. Tree species richness affected the SOC stocks primarily by increasing the quantity of leaf litter, and while decreasing the quality of leaf litter and fine root. In addition, tree species richness changed the chemical composition of SOC by affecting the chemical composition of the plant carbon, and soil bacterial \u03b1-diversity, thereby affecting the SOC stock. The trade-off between leaf litter and fine root C sources contributed to the quadratic relationship between tree species richness and SOC stocks. These results show that the mixing of 4-5 tree species can achieve a higher SOC level than having fewer or more tree species in a planted subtropical forest.",

In China, there are plans to increase the forest stock volume to 6.0 \u00d7 10 9 m 3 by 2030 to augment the national record in 2005 and eventually achieve national C neutrality by 2060. Most of this increase in C stocks will rely on planted forest ecosystems. It has been verified that East Asian monsoon subtropical forests contributed to large C uptakes in the 1990s and the 2000s, owing to their young stand ages and high levels of nitrogen deposition, coupled with sufficient and synchronous water and heat availability (Yu et al. 2014). However, the ways in which the capacity of the forest C sink, and that of other ecosystem services, can be further increased in the future are yet to be investigated. Native mixed-species forests with multiple species, which can provide valuable wood and ecological functions, are progressively being deemed a potential forest management strategy for replacing monospecific plantations (Bauhus et al. 2017). The species richness of trees in planted forests is not as complex as that of natural forests. Therefore, the optimal tree species richness required for increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks during the establishment of planted forest stands needs to be further explored in this region. Soil constitutes the largest reserve of terrestrial carbon (C) (K\u00f6chy et al. 2015) and has great potential to be a large C sink. Therefore, a slight change in SOC sequestration would have a significant impact on global C cycling and climate change. Recent studies have shown a positive relationship between tree species richness and productivity in terms of biomass (Liang et al. 2016). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that many other ecosystem functions that they are also positively correlated with tree species richness; however, the mixing effect is variable (Gamfeldt et al. 2013).",
        "1e4073d2-f736-4d8c-bbbb-7dd8939ad47a": "2013). According to several large-scale inventory studies and biodiversity assembly experiments on forests, the higher the tree species richness is, the greater the amount of aboveground and belowground biomass reaches, which further enhances the SOC stock (Gamfeldt et al. 2013;Chen et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2018;Liu et al. 2018;Li et al. 2020). However, this positive richness-SOC relationship has occasionally been challenged and questioned (Conti and D\u00edaz 2013;Carol Adair et al. 2018), such as in questions of effects of tree species composition on SOC pools (Dawud et al. 2016). Forest SOC stocks are resolved mainly by the equilibrium between two processes: above-and belowground litter inputs, and biodegradation (Jastrow et al. 2007). Tree species diversity may potentially influence SOC stocks by affecting both processes (Li et al. 2020). Many studies have shown that biodiversity promotes litter production among leaves and roots (Sun et al. 2017). However, in cases where leaf and root litter inputs do not enhance synchronously with increasing tree species richness, it is unclear whether there is a positive richness-SOC relationship. Furthermore, higher quality plant litter (e.g., litter of low C/N) results in faster accumulation of SOC than lowquality plant litter (Zhou et al. 2019). Alternatively, highquality plant litter may reduce the SOC stock by stimulating SOC decomposition via the priming effect (Sayer et al. 2011). SOC is a mixture of various organic C molecular constituents (Crow et al. 2009). These complex C chemical compositions have diverse grades of stability, in contrast to decay, in the ecosystem (Lorenz and Lal 2007). A large amount of SOC is derived from plant residual substances, and a large amount is converted by soil microbial residues (K\u00f6gel-Knabner 2002;Simpson et al. 2007;Liang et al. 2011;Miltner et al. 2012).",

SOC chemical compositions are further converted and stabilized during mineralization, and in the conceptual models of the fate of plant litter fragments, the aromatic and aliphatic fractions increase during decomposition (Hsu and Lo 1999). Carbohydrate fractions in soil are preferentially decomposed with soil warming in temperate and subtropical forests (Feng et al. 2008;Pisani et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2019a). Recent evidence has demonstrated that the chemical composition of SOC differs among diverse forest types (Quideau et al. 2001;Wang et al. 2010), and between monospecific and mixed forests (Wang et al. 2019b). However, the linkages between the chemical composition of SOC and the stock of SOC across various degrees of tree species richness remain unknown. In the present study, we examined the relationship between the SOC stock and chemical composition with tree species richness in an experimental reforested area. This was accomplished with the use of a planted forest that had been established via the random mosaic mixing of diverse subtropical tree species, which was managed in a close-tonature mode. We hypothesized that after 40 years of afforestation, (a) tree species richness would be positively correlated with the SOC stock in the planted forest, and (b) tree species richness would affect the SOC stock through the biomass and quality of leaf litter and fine roots, and the communities of soil bacteria and fungi.",

Bacteria are fundamental to ecosystem functions and strongly influence the coupling of coastal carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in soils. The SOC storage and bacterial communities along a restored mangrove soil chronosequence in the Jiulong River Estuary were explored using the 16S rDNA sequencing technique. The results showed the SOC storage in the 100 cm soil profile was 103.31 \u00b1 5.87 kg C m -2 and 93.10 \u00b1 11.28 kg C m -2 for mangroves with afforestation ages of 36 and 60 years, respectively.

Although the tidal flats and mangroves occupied the contiguous intertidal zone within several kilometers, the variations in the SOC storage along the restored mangrove soil chronosequence were notably higher. The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) database was used to annotate the metabolic functions of the bacteria in the soils. The annotation revealed that only four metabolic functions were enriched with a higher relative abundance of the corresponding bacteria, and these enriched functions were largely associated with sulfate reduction. In addition, the specifically critical bacterial taxa that were associated with the SOC accumulation and nutrient cycling, shaped the distinct metabolic functions, and consequently facilitated the SOC accumulation in the mangrove soils with various afforestation ages. The general homogenization of the microbial community and composition along the intertidal soil chronosequence was primarily driven by the reciprocating tidal flows and geographical contiguity.",

To be self-sustaining a forest needs to have or to accumulate sufficient nutrient capital and these nutrients must be cycled through the system so adequate amounts are available to meet the growth requirements of the vegetation. Hingston et al.

The lateritic soils are particularly low in nutrients, and the proportion of the total nutrients in the ecosystem that are contained in the vegetation and litter is high, when compared with other Australian eucalypt forests (Hingston et al. 1981).

To reach a productivity level equivalent to the pre-mining forest requires an input of nutrients to the Accepted for publication November 1995. system. In re-establishing a forest on mined areas that previously supported a jarrah forest, nitrogen (N) is the nutrient which is of most interest, because it is the nutrient most limiting the growth of trees both in the jarrah forest (Abbott & Loneragan 1986) and on rehabilitated bauxite mines (Ward et al. 1985) Most of the N held in the soil is in the organic matter and is released for uptake by the plants through mineralization. As mineralization rates are generally low, a large capital of N must be accumulated. Applying fertilizer to increase the N capital on rehabilitated bauxite mines is not practical because of the large amounts required, its ephemeral effect and its high cost. This contrasts to phosphorus (P) fertilizer, which has a high residual value in soils on rehabilitated bauxite mines and where a single application of P has proved adequate.",

Ward and Pickersgill (1985) found that the biomass and litter on a rehabilitated area at Del Park in 1978 had accumulated nearly 60% of the N contained in the biomass and litter on a forest site after only 3.5 years, although the distribution of this N was very different to the forest. Ward and Pickersgill (1985) considered that with continuing inputs of atmospheric N through the legume understorey and redistribution of the N in the understorey through litterfall and decomposition, the Del Park site was likely to develop into a forest with nutrient stores comparable to the jarrah forest without funher inputs of fenilizer. This study examined the distribution of biomass and nutrients in the same bauxite mine studied by Ward and PickersgiU (1985), 12 years later, 15,5 years after it was rehabilitated. In addition, the amount of litter falling to the forest floor and its nutrient content was measured for two separate 2 year periods, 4 6 years and 8-10 years after the area was rehabilitated.",

Fifteen and a half years after being rehabilitated, the biomass on this site had increased to 23% of that in a nearby jarrah forest carrying a 60 year old pole stand of  jarrah (Hingston et al. 1981), from around 10% at 3.5 years (Ward & Pickersgill 1985; Table 7). The mass of trees had increased 20-fold. Much of the understorey present at 3.5 years had senesced and at 15.5 years represented only 6% of the biomass, compared with 89% at 3.5 years. The weight of litter on the forest floor increased more \u00b1an four-fold to more than 401 ha ' from 3.5 to 15.5 years. The amount of Utter found in the jarrah forest is related to the time since the forest was last burnt but is usually substantially less than this. Hatch (1955) reported one jarrah forest site where 22.61 ha ' had accumulated after 20 years protection from fire. O'ConneU et al. (1978) found that 9.2 to 18.4t ha\"' of litter accumulated in 6 years after a prescribed bum on a number of jarrah forest sites. The large amount of litter on the rehabilitated site is probably a consequence of the senescence of the acacia-dominated understorey. At 3.5 years the understorey was an estimated 23.71 ha\"'. A large increase in the litter layer would have occurred after about 8 years as this understorey became senescent and collapsed. Much of the 19.71 ha ' of coarse litter at 15 years consisted of the fallen skeletons of these shrubs. The increase in biomass and litter in 12 years was 671 ha\"' or an average of 5.61 ha\"' year\"'.",

Comparisons with growth rates of young trees in the mature jarrah forest where they must compete with the larger trees are not satisfactory. Similarly, comparisons with growth rates of the same species in plantations on other sites where the soils are more fertile than the very infertile jarrah forest soils and where the young trees do not have to compete with a vigorous understorey are equally unsatisfactory. Jarrah planted as seedlings on a cleared area in an arboretum east of Dwellingup had an average DBHOB of 17.8 cm after 18 years (Abbott & Loneragan 1986). This corresponds to an average yearly growth in diameter of 1.0 cm. The diameter growth rates of the E. calophylla and E. maculata planted on this site were slightly greater than this. The trees appeared healthy and vigorous and there were no signs of nutrient or water stress. The trees are still in the pole stage of growth (Jacobs 1955) and have not developed large persistent branches and so should continue to increase in height. There was an estimated increase of 1402kg ha\"' of N on the site compared to the sampling 12 years before (Table 7). The greatest increase in N was in the soil where an extra 1230 kg ha' was found in the top 30 cm 15.5 years after rehabihtation, compared with 3.5 years. The average increase of N on the site was 117kg ha\"' year\"'. Assuming that 3kg ha\"' came from atmospheric deposition and 1.5 kg ha\"' from asymbiotic fixation (Baker &Aniwill 1981) an estimated 112kg ha\"'year\"'was fixed by the legume understorey and tree acacias (which represented a minor proportion of the total tree biomass). This estimate is higher than the estimates for symbiotically fixed N of 9kg ha\"' year\"' in E. diversicolor (O'ConneU <;r a/.",

However, it is comparable to fixation rates estimated for some agricultural legumes (Lynch & Wood 1988) and legumes on other severely disturbed sites with low initial stores of N. For example Dancer etal.{\\977) found that up to 151 kg ha\"' year\"' of N was fixed by agricultural legumes on chinaclay sand waste and Koch (1987) estimated that 207 kg ha\"' year\"' of N was fixed on a rehabilitated bauxite mine which had been heavily seeded and fertilized. The amount of N contained in the litter and trees increased markedly since the earUer sampling while the amount of N contained within the understorey had decreased with the decrease in understorey biomass (Table 7). The 281kg ha\"' N found in the Utter is comparable to the highest amount found by Adams and Attiwill (1986) in eight wet and dry sclerophyll forests in eastern Australia. The eucalypts had accumulated an average of 9kg ha\"' year\"' N. Assuming that 6kg ha\"' year\"' of the N in the annual litterfall came from the eucalypts and that leaching losses were negligible, the average annual uptake of N by the eucalypts was 15 kg ha\"' year\"'. This indicates that mineralization in the soil and Utter layer is able to supply more N than the 10 kg ha' that Hingston (1980) estimated is taken up by the vegetation each year in the jarrah forest. The amount of litter reaching the ground 4-6 and 8-10 years after rehabilitation was comparable to that measured in the jarrah forest and other dry sclerophyU forests (Hatch 1955;AttiwiU et al.",

The nitrogen content of the Utter was around three to four times greater than that of the dry sclerophyll forests, while the contents of other nutrients were similar. The nitrogen content of the litterfall was less when the rehabilitation was older due to the lesser contribution of the legumes to the litter. The average carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio of the litter falling when the rehabilitation was 8-10 years old was 59:1 (assuming a carbon content of 50%) compared to 127-141:1 found by O'Connell et al. (1979b) in the jarrah forest. The C:N ratio of the fine litter (< 1 cm diameter) was 46:1 compared with 106-156:1 iti the jarrah forest O' Connell et al. (1978). The comparatively low C:N ratio of the litter layer and the litter falling on the rehabilitated site suggests that net mineralization of N from the litter will be greater on the rehabilitated site than in the jarrah forest. The aim of rehabilitating bauxite mines is to establish a self-sustaining forest ecosystem. It is too early to determine whether the forest at Del Park will be selfsustaining in the long term. Nitrogen is the nutrient most limiting growth of trees on rehabilitated bauxite mines (Ward et al. 1985) and the indications are positive that the site will be self-sustaining in nitrogen. Stores of nitrogen in the soil, litter, understorey and in the total system and the transfer of nitrogen through litterfall exceed those measured in the jarrah forest, and the trees are growing at a satisfactory rate with no evidence of their growth being unduly limited by lack of nitrogen or other nutrients or by water supply. The trees on this site include eucalypts and acacias from the eastern states of Australia. Current rehabilitation retains the procedures that lead to increases in nutrient capital but only uses trees and understorey species from the jarrah forest.",

It now contains up to 62 species of understorey plants and each of Alcoa's mines has its own seed mix, which contains only species found in the area in pre-mining flora surveys. Topsoil handling methods are also being further refined to maximize the contribution of the topsoil to the post-mining flora (Ward et al. 1995). Additional research is planned to assess nutrient inputs, litterfall and decomposition, mineralization of organic C, N and P in the soil, and nutrient uptake on rehabilitated bauxite mines, particularly those where jarrah is the major species.",

We used a long-term, large-scale native reforestation project in the Scottish Highlands to assess the response of carbon storage and other ecosystem functions to reforestation and grazing exclusion. We measured aboveground carbon, topsoil carbon, topsoil nitrogen, decomposition rates, soil invertebrate feeding activity, tree regeneration, and ground-layer and moss height at 14 sites that are in the early stages of reforestation and fenced to exclude grazing. Reforestation areas were compared to unforested and mature forest areas that are both grazed and ungrazed, using 10 \u00c2 10 m plots. Aboveground carbon in the reforestation plots (1.4 kg/m 2 [95% CI: 0.6, 2.6], average age 20 years since reforestation) was c. 8% of the mature forest plots (17.1 kg/m 2 [13.1, 21.8]). Topsoil carbon was lower in the reforestation plots (18.78 kg/m 2 [11.79, 25.78]) than in the unforested (29.82 kg/m 2 [24.34, 35.29]) or mature forest (31.39 kg/m 2 [22.91, 39.88]) plots. Responses of other functions to the reforestation and grazing interventions varied. Our results suggest that reforestation may trigger carbon loss from areas with high initial soil carbon even with low disturbance establishment, at least in the short term. Our work emphasizes where we lack knowledge: on the potential for long-term re-accumulation of soil carbon under semi-natural native reforestation, soil carbon sequestration in the deeper soil layers, and the response of soil carbon to natural regeneration.",
        "836aa756-91bb-41d9-bb80-42e04597ecc8": "There is a global pledge to restore 350 million hectares of degraded forest, with multiple anticipated benefits, including carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, and livelihood enhancement (Dave et al. 2017). Forest expansion receives particular attention as a climate change mitigation strategy (Seddon et al. 2019). Given these initiatives, we urgently need scientific research on how reforestation can best be done and where it is most effective (Di Sacco et al. 2021). In the United Kingdom, the Committee on Climate Change recommends planting c. 30,000 ha a year to increase tree cover to 17% by 2050 and contribute to the country's net-zero target (Committee on Climate Change 2020). Forest cover in the United Kingdom is currently c. 13%, rising from a minimum of c. 5% at the beginning of the 20th century, covering 19% of Scotland, 15% of Wales, 10% of England, and 9% of Northern Ireland (Forest Research 2020). The U.K. government has so far failed to meet annual planting targets; in 2019-2020 only 13,660 ha of new forest was planted, more than 80% of which was in Scotland, where historically forest expansion has occurred most rapidly in the United Kingdom (Forest Research 2020;HM Government 2020). An analysis of global reforestation pledges suggests that restoring natural forest would store up to 42 times more carbon than plantation forest and provide greater co-benefits, such as habitat for associated native species (Lewis et al. 2019). A key portion of forest carbon is stored in the soil, c. 60% of total carbon in temperate forests, with forest soils storing close to half of global terrestrial organic carbon (Mayer et al. 2020). Forest restoration and expansion for climate change mitigation intends to enhance existing stores of carbon, but the outcome will depend on the location and type of forest establishment (Matthews et al. 2020). With forest growth carbon accumulation occurs aboveground, but the net outcome depends on the rate of tree growth and changes to soil carbon.",
        "b5e0f39e-c66e-46da-8084-e27d2a25ffe3": "Prior land-use influences this: afforestation of former cropland leads to the greatest carbon accumulation, whereas forest establishment on peatland leads to carbon losses (Thomas et al. 2015). Soil disturbance during forest establishment can drive net carbon losses, but can potentially be compensated for by carbon accumulation aboveground and inputs belowground with tree growth (Vanguelova et al. 2013;Mayer et al. 2020). It is widely recognized that forest establishment on deep peat (depth more than 50 cm) leads to overall carbon losses through soil disturbance and drying (Morison et al. 2012;Vanguelova et al. 2018). The outcome on shallow peats is less well understood (Vanguelova et al. 2018). Semi-natural forest, which will not be disturbed by harvesting, might provide a more certain carbon stock on these soil types, but modeling suggests that due to slower growth it takes longer to re-accumulate carbon lost during initial disturbance (Matthews et al. 2020). Even with low disturbance planting, native reforestation on carbon-rich soils can result in no net carbon storage after 39 years, as a consequence of soil carbon losses (Friggens et al. 2020). In the United Kingdom, soil carbon stocks are 86 times greater than the vegetation carbon store and the most carbon-rich soils are disproportionately found in Scotland (Milne & Brown 1997;Vanguelova et al. 2018). The Scottish uplands provide opportunities for forest expansion; however, carbon-rich soils occur in the uplands and there is mixed evidence on the impact of reforestation on net carbon balances in these areas (Vanguelova et al. 2018;Friggens et al. 2020;Matthews et al. 2020). Assessing the impact of forest expansion requires more than quantification of aboveground and belowground carbon stocks. It is important to monitor how other ecosystem functions respond, giving a wider view of the value of the new habitat for humans and other organisms (Kollmann et al. 2016).",

Tree establishment on heather moorland has been shown to influence belowground properties and processes, altering soil structure and functions, for example, by increasing nutrient availability, decomposition rates, and the abundance of soil fauna (Mitchell et al. 2007;Kollmann et al. 2016). Aboveground, the structure and composition of the vegetation determines habitat provision and the future of a reforested ecosystem depends on tree regeneration (Mitchell et al. 2012;Patterson et al. 2014). To provide a more holistic understanding of the impact of forest establishment, we measured soil nitrogen, decomposition rates, soil invertebrate feeding, tree regeneration, and vegetation structure. Changes in decomposition rates provide additional background to understand any changes in soil carbon and soil nutrient availability, which will be indicated by soil nitrogen levels. Soil invertebrate feeding provides a proxy to assess the abundance and activity of the soil fauna community. Tree regeneration is crucial to the continued development of the reforestation sites. Finally, we measured vegetation structure to quantify habitat provision and responses to grazing exclusion; in the Scottish Highlands, high deer numbers generally prevent tree regeneration, such that grazing exclusion is necessary to facilitate forest restoration (Tanentzap et al. 2013). We used a long-term large-scale native reforestation project in the Scottish Highlands to assess the effect of grazing exclusion and native reforestation on carbon storage and a suite of other ecosystem functions. Given that existing data on native reforestation in this context are primarily from experimental studies (e.g. Mitchell et al. 2007;Friggens et al. 2020), we use a conservation-focussed reforestation project that reflects likely future native reforestation in the Scottish uplands.

However, the CO 2 carbon exchange characteristics (Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange, and Ecosystem respiration) of Indian forests are poorly understood. Immense carbon sequestration opportunities exist with the natural as well as planted forests. Therefore, it becomes vital to assess the potential of existing forests (natural and planted) by means of the most accurate and reliable methods of eddy covariance (EC). It is also important to know the eco-physiological response of the forests towards diurnal, seasonal, and yearly changes in the prevailing environmental conditions. We analyzed CO 2 carbon exchange characteristics of a mature moist deciduous forest and a young mixed deciduous plantation located in the sub-tropical climate regime in the western Himalayan foothills of India with the help of co-located EC measurements (2016 to 2018). The study reveals that both the mature forest (-719.43 gCm -2 year -1 ) and young plantation (-467.49 gC m -2 year -1 ) are absorbing a significant amount of atmospheric CO 2 carbon. The maximum uptake of atmospheric CO 2 occurred during the post-monsoon season in both the forests. The minimum NEE of the mixed deciduous plantation was observed during the leaf fall period while the NEE of the moist deciduous forest was the lowest in monsoon due to a higher respiration rate during monsoon. Among the environmental factors, soil moisture showed maximum control on the productivity of both the forest ecosystems. The value reported in this study can help Forest Survey of India in establishing/ assessing emission factor for these particular forest types. This study can also help forest managers in carbon assessment of plantation under NDC.",

Understanding how variation in forest structure and composition influence the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and how this exchange is controlled by climatic conditions (Law et al. 2002;Shao et al. 2016;Fu et al. 2017;Mendes et al. 2020), vegetation types (Chen et al. 2019;Creevy et al. 2020) and anthropogenic interventions (Lindroth et al. 2018;Zhang et al. 2020) are critical information for assessing the variability of carbon fluxes across the landscape. This information can provide a baseline for developing models that can accurately predict carbon fluxes at regional scales, future changes in atmospheric CO 2 and climate (Irvine et al. 2004) and can help in designing strategies for climate change mitigation (Houghton et al. 2001). Tree species influence the rate of carbon exchange by their leaf traits, photosynthetic capacities, and litterfall patterns (Chen et al. 2020). Phenology is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning and is one of the most important controllers of plant productivity and its inter and intra-annual variation (Fu et al. 2014;Zhang et al. 2014;Wang et al. 2018;Pillai et al. 2019). Carbon sequestration in soil is strongly influenced by the species of trees planted on afforestation sites (Paul et al. 2002;Berthrong et al. 2009;Laganie `re et al. 2010;Li et al. 2012).",

Understanding the amount of carbon uptake, release, and storage by natural and planted forests and its variability with respect to the prevailing environmental conditions can be valuable information for determining their carbon sequestration potential and to policymakers working in sustainable ecosystem management. Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of CO 2 fixed by plants per unit time by the photosynthetic reduction of atmospheric CO 2 into organic compounds (Kirschbaum et al. 2001). It is a measure of carbon uptake by vegetation, therefore, improved knowledge about GPP can be a useful indicator of ecosystem health and the carbon cycle. Ecosystem respiration (RE) is the amount of CO 2 released back to the atmosphere through autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration and accounts for a large portion of the terrestrial GPP and carbon cycle. GPP and RE are affected by many abiotic and biotic factors, which can vary distinctively at different time scales. NEE is the difference between the carbon acquired through photosynthetic fixation (i.e., GPP) and the carbon released through RE (Kirschbaum et al. 2001). This difference in the value defines the source and sink nature of the ecosystem. Thus, any change in GPP or RE can alter an ecosystem NEE to a source or a sink of CO 2 (Richardson et al. 2007). Despite the importance of terrestrial NEE, its response to climate is a major source of uncertainty in future climate predictions (Friedlingstein et al. 2014). A better understanding of the variability of NEE within an ecosystem can provide an insight into the carbon dynamics of that ecosystem. Pan et al. (2011) estimated a net global forest sink of 1.1 \u00b1 0.8 PgC year -1 . However, the study presented by them also highlighted the lack of information in a vast land area of Southeast Asia, Middle East, Mongolia, Greenland, and Alaska region. Information on carbon stock and fluxes from these regions can help in the accurate prediction of global carbon sink by forest.",

GPP and RE can be partitioned from directly measured NEE components of EC tower measurements (Falge et al. 2002). EC in combination with meteorological data provides invaluable information on the response of the ecosystem to environmental conditions and climate change (Baldocchi et al. 2018). In India, the study of carbon exchange using EC tower has gained its momentum in the present decade and is expected to increase in the future (Patel et al. 2019). To date, limited numbers of studies have been reported from Indian forests using EC measurement (Jha et al. 2013;Rodda et al. 2016;Deb Burman et al. 2017;Watham et al. 2017;Chatterjee et al. 2018;Mukherjee et al. 2018;Bhat et al. 2019;Sarma et al. 2019;Singh et al. 2019). The studies reported from India are based on short-term or maximum of one-year observation, except the study carried out by Mukherjee et al. (2018). Therefore, the reported values do not consider inter-annual variation and hence may deviate from the actual carbon exchange value of the ecosystems. Acknowledging the role of forest in stabilization and reduction of GHGs, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) came up with a mechanism like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), which was further enhanced to REDD?. REDD ? can be a costefficient initiative in slowing down the increase in the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and effectively buy much needed time for the countries to move to lower emissions technologies (FAO 2008).

Afforestation is an important contributor for the mitigation of the accelerated greenhouse effect.

A major emphasis is on planting mixed native species both within and outside the forest areas with multiple benefits to wildlife and local livelihoods. Gradually, mixed native species plantation are being raised instead of monoculture plantation of exotic species. Although mixed-species plantation of native origin have benefited both local ecology and economy, yet, to what extent they sequester atmospheric CO 2 as compared to fast-growing exotic tree species is not well understood. Investment in improving the productivity of forest resources and testing of indigenous alternatives to conventional agroforestry species such as Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia spp. was envisaged in the eleventh five-year plan (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012) (Planning Commission 2007). Under the National Carbon Project (NCP) of ISRO-Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the EC towers were established to ascertain the carbon exchange characteristics of natural forests (moist deciduous forest dominated by sal (Shorea robusta)) and planted forests (comprising associated species of sal). Sal dominated forests cover over 13.30 % of the Indian forest (Satya and Nayaka 2005) and occur all along the Western, Central, and parts of Eastern Himalayan foothills in India (Kushwaha and Nandy 2012).

Thus, the Chinese government has launched a series of new forestry policies to combat the degraded environment, such as implementing timber harvesting reduction, reforestation, and afforestation programs on a national scale (Zhang et al., 2000;Wang et al., 2007). Land degradation is the most prominent in the subtropical hilly red soil region of China, which covers over 20 million hectares and has a high population density (Zheng et al., 2004). Historically, it was covered by evergreen forests; local climax forest species were Schima spp., Castanopsis spp., Quercus spp., Cylobalanopsis spp., etc. However, increasing demand for firewood, timber and food, intensive anthropogenic disturbances, especially harvesting, slash burning, and litter racking, accompanied with excessive livestock grazing, have destroyed the evergreen vegetation in the region and turned it into a ''red desert.'' Restoring the ''red desert,'' under the new federal forestry policy, by re-establishing vegetation, improving soil quality, and establishing forests, has emerged as the region's top priority (Liu et al., 2004;Zheng et al., 2004;Yan et al., 2007). How to restore such a deteriorated ''desert'' landscape to enhance ecosystem function (i.e., carbon sequestration), meet government goals, and contribute to the climate change portfolio is an imperative question. We designed a long-term Forest Restoration Experimental Project (FREP) in the ''red desert'' region (Taihe County, Jiangxi province) to explore the effectiveness of the restoration and the recovery of ecosystem functions. Natural recovery in many ecosystems can take decades to centuries, but there is often considerable social pressure to intervene and accelerate this process, particularly in areas visible to the public (i.e., near urban settings) (Holl and Aide, 2011). Numerous debates have focused on whether active restoration is always necessary (Rey Benasys et al., 2009).",
        "f13eb5a7-bea8-45cd-a505-63b7b41cf9cd": "For example, when adequate soil and seed resources are available, natural succession can occur (McLachlan and Bazely, 2001;Letcher and Chazdon, 2009). Holl and Aide (2011) proposed a conceptual framework in guiding when and where to actively restore ecosystems with caveats that some ecosystems may recover rapidly without human intervention, especially in tropical ecosystems. However, places, like our study areas, with a history of intensive and prolonged land abuse have reached a point that natural regeneration is impossible because the propagules are no longer available (i.e., seed bank, resprouts, or existing seedlings). Traditional views of restoring degraded land using pioneer species or introducing hardy alien species to increase the likelihood of species colonization and establishment (Hobbs and Norton, 1996;Zhang and Xu, 1999) have changed since attention became focused on ecosystem structure (Alexander et al., 2011). Currently, most restoration designs are based on the structural features of ecosystems, and the best designs consider the hydrological processes that may be necessary, but are not currently sufficient, to recover desired ecosystem services (Euliss et al., 2008). Ecosystem function, such as carbon sequestration, is rarely considered in restoration projects, although some studies have proposed using species mixtures (Liu et al., 2011) or local climax species (Zimmerman et al., 2000;Du et al., 2008) to address functions not available in monocultures. Understanding the rate and trajectory of restoration is critical but often challenging. Fast recovery can be achieved through active intervention, even on severely altered sites (Jackson and Hobbs, 2009). Estimating the trajectory of restoration is more challenging because knowledge of the state of the original ecosystem and its history is invaluable, but often unavailable, and rarely spans more than the past few decades. Therefore, Jackson and Hobbs (2009) suggested that restoration should assess ecological history through indirect means, ranging from documentary sources to paleoecological records from natural archives. Fortunately, the local natural reserves and protected areas in our study area provide an ideal trajectory for our FREP study.",

        "8b548047-f913-45b2-afaf-94010a38d0ab": "Our 19 years of experimental data clearly demonstrated that the active restoration by native species worked well in the FREP site (Fig. 1), a severely degraded red soil barren landscape in Jiangxi, China (FAO, 1989). The active restoration strategy selected in our FREP study was successful, although determining which strategies to use is often challenging because the strategies vary by location and degree of ecosystem degradation (Cairns et al., 1977;Hobbs and Norton, 1996;Du et al., 2004). The common restoration paradigm uses pioneer species that have high survival rates to colonize a landscape, then gradually introduces local climax species once the environmental conditions permit (Aide et al., 2000). Indeed, some studies have been done to re-introduce local species into degraded lands using various methods (i.e., sowing, transplanting, and perching), and such efforts were often accompanied with the control of alien species using cutting, tilling, burning, and/or herbicide application (Van Andel and Aronson,  (Du et al., 2008), as in our case, to restore highly degraded barren landscapes with great success. The success of this project provides valuable information on large scale for afforestation and reforestation projects in China. We observed similar carbon sequestration capabilities within restoration functional groups (Fig. 2). In contrast, a case study in Australian rainforests found that restored forests with high species diversity of trees stored significantly more carbon in above-ground biomass than monocultures and mixed-species forests in industrial plantations (Kanowski and Catterall, 2010). We speculated that the tropical rainforests might have a different carbon dynamic pattern than in our study area, and thus, passive restoration strategies might be more suitable for tropical restoration (Letcher and Chazdon, 2009). It is also possible that since our study is still in the early stages that the carbon pool size differentiation among functional groups has not appeared yet. Conventional wisdom appears to suggest that, in general, ecosystem services from climax forests cannot be provided by plantations, despite the wider range of positive responses from increasing forest coverage.",
        "98350fd8-deda-4ba2-ac87-2187cb31e702": "For example, monoculture restoration has low species diversity, which is prone to pests and pathogens (Alexander et al., 2011). There is also evidence that monocultures might increase run-off from fertilizers and pesticide, deplete groundwater, have limited below-ground carbon sequestration, and have impoverished food webs. In addition, monocultures often provide virtually no cultural and subsistence resources for local and indigenous communities (Holl and Aide, 2011). Although we observed similar TEC stocks among functional groups, it did not support pursing environmental markets, such as forest carbon offsets (Palmer and Filoso, 2009). Palmer and Filoso (2009) warned that the danger of marketing ecological services without properly understanding the potential shortfalls might interfere with other benefits. The ecosystem services are supported by a complex network of biophysical processes and ecosystem features, which take longer to be restored (Ehrenfeld, 2000). Restoration ecology has emerged as an allied practice and scientific discipline in forest land management (Sarr et al., 2004;Burger, 2009). Restoration in forestry science is relatively new, but restoration as an organized forestry practice has been around for a long time based on the recovery of fire-dependent ecosystems, such as longleaf pine (Hermann, 1993;Gilliam and Platt, 2006) and ponderosa pine (Covington et al., 1997), and on the restoration of bottomland hardwood ecosystems (Stanturf et al., 2000). In most cases, research and practice applied in these areas have been pragmatic, with an objective of improving degraded conditions to increase soil quality and timber value (Bradshaw, 1987). Wenger et al. (2000) wondered if this practice is good forest stewardship. They warned against a more purist approach of restoration toward a reference condition that can't be known due to inadequate knowledge. In any case, neglect should not be an alternative because of a lack of agreement on what to call the process of ecosystem recovery (Wenger et al., 2000).",
        "de02aeed-141e-4f82-9a10-f16ac3d5272a": "Some researchers also expressed concerns about the lack of knowledge about the original condition of ecosystem and its history. Often, restoration practitioners are forced to assess ecological history by indirect means, such as documentaries or paleoecological records from natural archives (Jackson and Hobbs, 2009). In FREP, luckily, surrounding nature reserves and protected areas provided us with a good reference for restoration (Wang et al., 2011). This study agrees with Gerber (2011) that, with all things being equal, the restoration of resilient and sustainable forest ecosystems should promote the reestablishment of diverse assemblages of native species best adapted to the particular site conditions rather than single species plantations (Gerber, 2011). A regression model based on our synthesized above-ground biomass carbon data showed that the trajectory of the restored schima forest was much slower than the current local schima plantation or naturally regenerated forests (Fig. 3). This difference is an expected phenomenon because the highly deteriorated soils in the FREP sites might be inhibiting the schima growth compared to the other industrial plantations or natural regenerations sites with fertile soils. We also should acknowledge that restoration trajectory pathways were affected by the degree of change from the historical system and the intensity and time of human intervention (Jackson and Hobbs, 2009). The primary goal of our study was to evaluate the allocation of carbon pools within forest stands, functional groups, and restoration types of the barren forest restoration project in Jiangxi, China. Unfortunately, comparisons of our carbon pool components to other studies were hampered because carbon pool estimates are influenced differently by site-specific disturbance regimes and the definitions of some major carbon pools also vary, especially for dead organic matter and SOC (Grier and Logan, 1977;Schlesinger, 1977;Matthews, 1997). Fortunately, live tree carbon has a relatively clear definition and comparable methodologies among the studies (Table 4), and we synthesized the available literature on SOC with the same definition as our study (Table 5). As expected, the carbon pool sizes of our study were consistently lower than other studies of similar forests in this region (Table 4).",
        "eb87b324-4ead-4eab-8535-2df16d22e99b": "The mean live tree carbon in the FREP restoration forest was about 68% lower than similar ecosystems in the region. Soil stores organic carbon mainly in the top layers, especially the top 40 cm, and SOC density decreases dramatically with depth (Batjes, 1996;Wang et al., 2010Wang et al., , 2011)). Batjes (1996) synthesized soil carbon stock studies around the world and concluded that the top 50 cm of soil contains about 60-80% of the total soil carbon stock up to 1 m in depth. Another study, conducted near our study site, reported that the top 40 cm of red soil contains over 60% of the total soil organic carbon stock (Wang et al., 2011). Thus, we used the top 40 cm of the total soil organic carbon stock as a proxy to represent the soil carbon pool at the FREP site (Table 5). Another goal of our study was to gain broader insights into general forest restoration carbon pool structure, dynamics, and its potential implications. Both size and allocation of carbon among pools vary greatly within our study region (Fig. 4). For example, the SOC (top 40 cm) accounted for 78% of total carbon at our study sites, in contrast to industrial plantations, where the SOC accounted for 19% of the TEC (Tu and Liu, 2007). The natural regeneration stand had a more balanced carbon distribution between SOC and live tree carbon at 57% and 43%, respectively (Wang et al., 2011). These differences in carbon pool structures between the FREP restoration site and the industrial plantation suggests that, in early stand development in highly degraded areas, soils need to build up a below-ground carbon pool before trees and above-ground biomass can flourish. Thus, fast SOC accumulation may be necessary at deteriorated sites, such as FREP, as part of the restoration process. In contrast, a fast above-ground biomass carbon accumulation may occur in well-established soils, such as those found at industrial plantations and natural stands.",
        "b6c903d8-7f36-4da7-99f8-72bbc1508f16": "Additionally, the mean live tree carbon pool of the natural stands and industrial plantation was about 76% and 75% higher than the mean of the FREP restoration, respectively, supporting this conclusion. The mean SOC (top 40 cm) at FREP was 35% lower than the mean of natural regeneration, but was 73% higher than the mean of the industrial plantation, which suggests that the three sites are at different stages in their recovery/successional trajectories (Fig. 4). These allocation patterns provide useful information for management and conservation practices in our study region. The relatively large live tree carbon pool for industrial plantations suggest that these forests are more amenable to storing carbon above ground through management and conservation efforts that promote tree growth, since the soil is already able to support them, whereas degraded ecosystems like FREP that need to store more carbon in soil initially are more amenable to storing carbon below ground to increase its ability to support trees. Lastly, knowledge of a site's recovery trajectory is important to know where carbon is being retained in the ecosystem. Thus, understanding carbon pool allocations and their dynamics during the restoration process will help inform other large scale forest restoration projects and improve our efforts at carbon sequestration in China (Wang et al., 2007). The mean annual net primary production (NPP, 1.9 Mg C ha \u00c01yr \u00c01 ) in FREP was very low compared to other studies in this region (Table 4), possibly due to the early stages of the restoration or the deteriorated soil that provides insufficient nutrients for trees to grow. The NPP also varied greatly by species, stand age, location, and even methodologies. In comparison, Whittaker (1975) estimated that the world forests had an average NPP of about 6-7 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , and Rodin (1982) estimated that the NPP of sub-tropical and semi-arid regions was between 6.9 and 12.8 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 (Whittaker, 1975;Rodin, 1982).",
        "921be3ee-5962-4191-924b-19187cebc1b0": "The NPP calculated in our study was much smaller than the modelling estimates in the sub-tropical evergreen forest region of China by the Chikugo model (29.5 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ) (Ni, 1996), smaller than in the Yangtze River evergreen forest in China by the CASA model (36.5 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ) (Ke et al., 2003), and also smaller than in the evergreen forest in China by the CASA model (52.5 Mg C ha \u00c01yr \u00c01 ) (Piao et al., 2001). However, our study was very close to the most recent estimates calculated by forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies by Pan et al. (2011) who estimated that the world net carbon stock changed about 1.04 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 from 1990 to 2007, while the net carbon stock change in China increased from 0.96 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 from 1990-1999 to 1.22 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 from 2000 to 2007 (Pan et al., 2011).",

This presents Ireland with the opportunity to offset carbon emissions through carbon sequestration in forests, as the latter are known to sequester a large amount of carbon into the tree biomass. However, the effects of afforestation on soil organic carbon in the Irish humid temperate climate are not well understood. In this study we use the paired site methodology to assess the impact of afforestation on the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) of 21 \u00c3 2 sites across Ireland. We found that afforestation of Irish soils (0-30 cm depth) resulted in no significant change in SOCD. However, the low number of sites within the study is a source of uncertainty and more work must be done to assess SOCD change before any firm conclusions can be made. This work provides baseline data and future work estimating soil C changes due to land use or management changes should use the equivalent soil mass (ESM) correction method instead of the volume based method. The latter can over-or underestimate SOCD change due to variability in soil bulk density after afforestation. The large afforestation programmes to be implemented in Ireland in the next decade provides an opportunity to greatly improve estimates of Irish SOCD change. We suggest implementing a large number of resampling studies, measuring the change in SOCD following afforestation for a number of factors for a number of years.",
        "04f9f6ae-9775-4dd2-96c0-4bdb342ba261": "At the beginning of the twentieth century forests covered only 1% of the total Irish land area (Pilcher and Mac an tSaoir, 1995). However, due to the efforts of successive governments there has been rapid afforestation since the 1960s resulting in a 10.0% (697,730 ha) forest land cover as of 2007 (NFI, 2007a). A large proportion of this afforestation took place after the mid-1980s, encouraged by government grant incentives targeted at private landowners. Consequently, 63% of Irish forests are less than 20 years old (NFI, 2007a), providing Ireland the opportunity to contribute to meeting its international obligations set forth by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992). These obligations include the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. In order to promote accountability for these commitments, the UNFCCC treaty and the Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto Protocol, 1997) mandate signatories to publish greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories for both greenhouse gas sources and sinks. Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol allows changes in carbon (C) stocks due to afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation since 1990 to be used to offset inventory emissions. Therefore, due to the rapid rate of afforestation and the increased ecosystem (biomass, forest floor, and soil) carbon sequestration since 1990, Ireland's recent afforestation programme has the potential to significantly offset its GHG emissions. It is well established that there is a large increase in the carbon stored in the aboveground biomass following afforestation (Morris et al., 2007;Black et al., 2009;Mendoza-Ponce and Galicia, 2010), but the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) are still uncertain (Kirschbaum et al., 2008). Soils contain approximately two-thirds of the C stored within forest ecosystems (Dixon et al., 1994).",
        "1dc4ad14-194a-49c5-94a0-a93d0d9d1dc4": "The residence time of stable fractions of SOC can be >1000 years (von Lutzow et al., 2006) making it a much more stable sink than living plant biomass (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010). In addition to being able to estimate the carbon in tree biomass, it is therefore vital to measure the change in SOC stocks following afforestation, and to determine the mechanisms involved in controlling SOC dynamics. Soil C stocks are determined by the balance between the inputs of C through litterfall and rhizodeposition and the loss of C mainly through soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition (Jandl et al., 2007). The change in soil C following afforestation is controlled by a number of factors, including: previous land use (grasslands, cropland, etc); tree species; soil cultivation method; soil properties (clay content, pH); stand age; site management; topography and climate (Guo and Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002;Jandl et al., 2007;Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010). A number of studies have been conducted to investigate afforestation induced soil C changes with different conclusions. Some studies have found no change in SOC stocks after afforestation (Davis, 2001;Davis et al., 2003;DeGryze et al., 2004;Smal and Olszewska, 2008;Peri et al., 2010). Others have found an increase in SOC stocks (Post and Kwon, 2000;Guo and Gifford, 2002;Del Galdo et al., 2003;Hooker and Compton, 2003;Mao et al., 2010) while some have found a decrease in SOC stocks (Perrott et al., 1999;Ross et al., 1999;Chen et al., 2004;Farley et al., 2004).",
        "18ff71b4-63e4-4cf2-8029-8d2132dd4865": "However, several studies have shown a similar trend where initially there is a reduction in SOC stocks as the decomposition of soil organic matter is greater than the input of organic matter from the trees. Over time the soil organic matter input increases with the productivity of the forest stands and the soils switch from being a C source to a C sink. This can lead to an eventual recovery of soil C to the pre-afforestation levels and in some situations surpass them (Romany\u00e0 et al., 2000;Davis and Condron, 2002;Paul et al., 2002;Turner et al., 2005;Ritter, 2007;Hu et al., 2008;Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010;Mao et al., 2010). A number of reviews have been conducted to examine the effects of afforestation on soil C stocks globally (Guo and Gifford, 2002;Paul et al., 2002;Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010) and for specific countries (Davis and Condron, 2002). The latter, in a review of paired plot (adjacent plots on same soils, one afforested, and one as original land use) studies of coniferous forestry in New Zealand found an initial loss of soil C, before recovery to pre-afforestation levels after 20 years. Guo and Gifford (2002) in a meta-analysis of different land use changes on soil C reported a 10% decline in SOC with afforestation of pasture land and a 13% reduction from conversion of native forest to plantation forestry. It was found that when pasture and native forests were afforested with broadleaf, there was little change; however, there was a significant loss in soil C following afforestation with pine (Guo and Gifford, 2002). Paul et al. (2002), in a review of 43 afforestation studies found, the key factors in order of importance to be: previous land use; climate; and the type of forest. Lagani\u00e8re et al.",

(2010) published a metaanalysis (synthesised from 33 publications) of the impacts of afforestation on the soil C stocks of agricultural land. They found that the main factors effecting soil C change to be, in order of importance: previous land use; tree species; soil clay content; pre-planting disturbance; and to a lesser extent, climatic zone. Two studies have examined the impact of afforestation on the C stocks of mineral soils in Ireland, with different conclusions. Black et al. (2009) analysed a chronosequence of Sitka spruce stands on surface-water gley soils in Co. Wicklow, and found an increase in soil C stocks from the pre-afforestation grassland site to the 9 year old spruce site, and further increases with stand age. Wellock (2011) in an ash forest chronosequence located on brown earth soils in the Irish midlands, observed a continuous decline in SOC stocks from the pre-afforestation grassland sites with stand age up to the 27 years old. Thereafter, the SOC stock began to increase. Although the soil begins to sequester C (after age 27), it did not accrue C as quickly, as it was initially released from the soil, with the result that the SOC stocks of the 47 year old ash forest were only 79% of pre-afforestation grassland levels. The differing conclusions of the two Irish studies may be due to the large difference in growth rates, with the biomass of the ash forests of Wellock (2011) accumulating 1.83 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 while the Sitka spruce stands of Black et al. (2009) have a biomass uptake ranging between 5.8 and 15.1 Mg C ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 over the age of the stand. However, more work must be done to fully determine the impacts of afforestation on Irish soil C stocks and the controlling factors.",
        "106a4f1c-fadb-40b9-bf7b-16f6b72d883f": "The most commonly used method to determine soil C stocks is the volume-based method which multiplies the SOC concentration (%) by bulk density (g cm \u00c03 ) to a fixed depth. Soil bulk density varies spatially and temporally (Amador et al., 2000;Gifford and Roderick, 2003;Kulmatiski and Beard, 2004;Lee et al., 2009;Wuest, 2009) and the volume-based method does not account for variations in soil mass and this introduces uncertainty in SOC stock changes (Ellert and Bettany, 1995;Markewitz et al., 2002;Murty et al., 2002;Lee et al., 2009;Mao et al., 2010). The equivalent soil mass (ESM) correction was proposed by Ellert and Bettany (1995) as a more reliable method to determine changes in soil C stock among land use or management practices and a number of studies have used it since (Ellert and Bettany, 1995;Yang and Wander, 1999;Gifford and Roderick, 2003;VandenBygaart, 2006;VandenBygaart and Angers, 2006;Lee et al., 2009;Wuest, 2009;Mao et al., 2010). The ESM is defined as the reference soil mass per unit area chosen in a layer and the equivalent C mass (ECM) is the C stored in an ESM (Ellert et al., 2001;Mao et al., 2010). The objectives of this paired plot study were: (1) to quantify the carbon stored in the forest floor and soil (0-30 cm depth) of 21 forest sites and their 21 adjacent non-forest site on same soils; and (2) to assess the impacts of afforestation on soil carbon stocks using the paired plot method.",
        "9aeb72c0-6606-4a6c-a28d-8ef53dfd00b2": "We found little differences between the SOCD (0-30 cm) of the non-forest and forest site, suggesting that there is little change in SOCD following afforestation which has been seen in the literature, with Poeplau et al. (2011) noting small but non-significant losses of SOCD following afforestation of grasslands. The same result is found when the forest floor carbon stocks are added to that of the SOCD. This finding is in contrast to the results of two chronosequence studies that assessed the impact of afforestation on SOCD in Ireland. Wellock (2011) in a chronosequence of ash forests in central Ireland reported an overall decrease of 21% of SOCD over 47 years, while Black et al. (2009), in a chronosequence of Sitka spruce in eastern Ireland, saw a large increase in SOCD from the pre-afforestation value of 97.2-137.3 Mg C ha \u00c01 at the 16 year old site. The lack of statistically significant changes in SOCD found in this study may be due to the low number of sites that were sampled as well as the variability of characteristics between sites. Large variability is a constant problem when assessing land-use change effects on SOCD and hampers a studies ability to detect changes in SOCD. A possible explanation for the two Irish chronosequences finding significant changes with afforestation is that the number of variables under investigation was limited to age as tree specie and soil type were held constant over a narrow topographical range. Further sites must be sampled before it can be fully determined that there is no change in SOCD following afforestation in Ireland due to the high variability within sites found in this study. These sites should be selected to enhance the findings of this study. The results of the two Irish chronosequences and this study show that more work must be done to determine the role that forest type plays in determining change in SOCD following afforestation. The results found in the chronosequences are counter to what has been shown in the literature, while this study found no change associated with forest type.",
        "bfc14dae-5b18-4ae4-9b90-dd5ddb72fc9e": "Future sampling efforts should sample a greater number of broadleaf stands as this forest type had the lowest number of sampled sites in this study with three sites, which is crucial as broadleaf planting is to increase to 30% of all afforestation in Ireland. It has been noted in the literature that the clay content of a soil can impact the change in SOCD following afforestation (Paul et al., 2002). Lagani\u00e8re et al. (2010) notes that those sites with a clay content greater than 33% have a greater capacity to accumulate SOC than soils with a lower clay content. This present study only measured one site (CG4) with a high clay content and so more clay sites must be measured to fully determine the effects of clay content on SOCD sequestration in Ireland. It is current Irish government policy to increase forest cover from its current 10% (NFI, 2007a) to 17% by 2030 (Department of Agriculture, 1996). This provides an opportunity to establish a large number of resampling studies, covering a number of differing forest variables, i.e. forest type, pre-afforestation land use, etc. The resampling studies should be identified prior to cultivation, so that the soil C stocks of the pre-afforestation land use can be measured to further investigate the effects of site cultivation and stand establishment on soil C stocks. Resampling studies are preferable to paired plot studies as they measure change over time, contrary to the paired plot method which only measures one point in time, and may over-or underestimate soil C changes if the selected nonforest site is not appropriate (Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010). We found that the C stored within the forest floor of the conifer stands are significantly larger than that found within the broadleaf or mixed stands.",

There was very little difference between the SOCD calculated using the volume based method and the ESM method for the 0-30 cm soil layer. However, there were greater differences in  the 10 cm soil layers, with the 0-10 cm layer of the ESM method being lower than the volume based method. Using the ESM method the 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil layers had a higher SOCD than those calculated using the volume based method. This is further highlighted when comparing the SOCD of the 0-30 cm layer of the different forest types. The bulk density values of the broadleaf forests significantly decreased following afforestation while the bulk densities of the conifer forests increased by a small amount. Using the ESM method, the change in bulk densities with afforestation are removed from the estimation of SOCD change with afforestation. The SOCD of the broadleaf sites increased, while the SOCD of the conifer forests decreased following afforestation due to changes in SOC following afforestation. However, if the volume based method were to be used the opposite would be observed as there is a large change in bulk density with afforestation, which is overshadowing a smaller change in SOC for both forest types. The selection of a suitable non-forest site is crucial when using the ESM method for calculating the change in SOCD following afforestation. A poor choice of non-forest site may bring in variables other than land-use change that may influence the change in bulk density. We do not believe it to be an issue for this study, but future work should make certain that all non-forest sites are appropriate to sample, not only for the paired site methodology but for the ESM method also.",

We use environmental and social data to assess the relative effects of key hypothesised drivers on aboveground biomass accumulation at the farm-level over ten years. We supplement this with a qualitative analysis of perspectives from local farmers and agroforestry technicians on the potential causal mechanisms of the observed social effects. We find that the material wellbeing of farmers (e.g. assets) and access to agroforestry knowledge explain as much variation in biomass as water availability. Local perspectives suggest that this is caused by the higher adaptive capacity of some farmers and their associated ability to respond to social-ecological shocks and stresses. Additionally, the variation in biomass between farms increased over time. Local perspectives suggested that this was caused by emergent exogenous and stochastic influences which cannot be reliably predicted in technical analyses and guidance. To deal with this persistent uncertainty, local perspectives emphasised the need for flexible and adaptive processes at the farm-and village-levels. The consistency of these findings across three countries suggests these findings are relevant to similar forest restoration interventions. Our findings provide novel quantitative evidence of a social-ecological pathway where the adaptive capacity of local land users can improve ecological processes. Our findings emphasize the need for forest restoration programmes to prioritise investment in the capabilities of local land users, and to ensure that rules support, rather than hinder, adaptive management.",

The success of FLR initiatives, however, has so far has been mixed (Aronson and Alexander 2013;Mansourian et al 2017). A major challenge for restoration and other land management schemes is the difficulty of predicting, controlling and managing the outcomes of interventions in what are often highly complex and variable social-ecological systems (Messier et al 2015). There is ongoing debate on the drivers of FLR outcomes, with different perspectives giving varying levels of emphasis to environmental and social factors. Some emphasise biophysical aspects and the need to build and support the integrity of ecological communities-there may be social benefits, but objectives can be primarily ecological, knowledge is technical, and minimising human intervention is seen as key (J. C. Suding et al 2015, Brudvig et al 2017, Aronson et al 2018, Higgs et al 2018, Temperton et al 2019). Others emphasise the importance of institutional and social contexts that support good governance and adaptive management for sustainable and socially beneficial restoration (Van Oosten 2013b, Mansourian 2016). This divergence of perspectives on the drivers of environmental outcomes also extends to the related fields of conservation and payments for ecosystem services (Soule 2013, Pascual et al 2014, Naeem et al 2015, Ezzine-de-blas et al 2016), and to the fields of land system science where existing models and approaches continue to struggle to integrate local-level social factors and context (Stephanson andMascia 2014, Iwamura et al 2018). Effective interdisciplinary approaches to FLR and similar interventions remain rare (Huber-Stearns et al 2017, Mansourian et al 2017). One of the key gaps in interdisciplinary FLR remains the quantification of how local (e.g.",
        "fcc62b8b-126d-42a7-a153-15ebefe8ad0a": "household-level) social factors drive biophysical outcomes, and clear knowledge on their causality (Wortley et al 2013, Chazdon et al 2017). While the field of restoration ecology has generated a wealth of quantitative empirical research on how environmental aspects drive outcomes (Perring et al 2015), due to the difficulty of measuring social phenomena, ex-post quantitative field studies testing the effects of social drivers have remained rare (Geist and Galatowitsch 1999, Miller and Hobbs 2007, Le et al 2012, Kibler et al 2018, Sapkota et al 2018). In the land systems, forest transition and FLR literature, existing ex-post field studies that do cover the social drivers of biophysical outcomes have mainly focused on showing how socio-economic factors influence land users to join a scheme (e.g. Yin et al 2010, Mullan andKontoleon 2012, Baynes et al 2017). While useful for targeting initial tree planting, there remains a dearth of field studies quantitatively assessing how social drivers effect biophysical outcomes (e.g. tree growth) at the local level. The few field studies that do assess biophysical outcomes have mainly focused on broad assessments of project-level factors such as institutional design and economic incentives, and have found that social drivers are secondary to environmental drivers (Yackulic et al 2011, Le et al 2014). However, such projectlevel assessment likely miss the great social diversity at sub-project (e.g. household) levels which likely has great effect on land management and tree care (Tittonell et al 2005, Nahuelhual et al 2018, Pritchard et al 2018). A consequence of the lack of fine-grained social analyses, is that models and guidance for predicting and managing FLR outcomes are often focused on technical, largely environmental, factors (Wortley et al 2013). On the other hand, in implementation, land management schemes are challenged to contend with a much broader array of both social and environmental factors (Van Oosten 2013).",

Here we begin to address this gap through an novel ex-post, field-based interdisciplinary quantitative analysis of environmental and social drivers of tree biomass accumulation across 639 smallholder agroforestry farms restoring native tree species in projects in Mexico, Uganda and Mozambique. To our knowledge this is the first such quantitative analysis of its kind. Additionally, as we will elaborate, the consistency of our results across three countries strengthens the generalisability of our findings to similar land management interventions. Agroforestry with native species is increasingly advocated as a key method of FLR, where farmers can increase native tree cover while maintaining crop production in agricultural landscapes (Erdmann 2005, Schroth et al 2011, Robiglio and Reyes 2016). Smallholders are estimated to manage approximately 75% of the world's agricultural land (Lowder et al 2016), and to make up most of the world's poor (Morton 2007). Thus, many FLR initiatives, and particularly those in developing countries, will engage smallholders-and native-species agroforestry offers a key way to do this. We focus on five key environmental and social factors theorised (by both experts and local land users) to drive biomass outcomes in such interventions: water availability; soil quality; existing tree cover at time of planting; household wealth and living standards (henceforth 'material wellbeing'; White 2010); and household access to agroforestry knowledge. The environmental variables cover the key ecological considerations in designing agroforestry systems: sufficient water and soil nutrients are fundamental for tree growth, while tree cover at the time of planting serves as a proxy for inter-plant competition (Ashton andMontagnini 1999, Corona-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al 2018).",

For access to agroforestry knowledge, both vertical (expert to farmer) and horizontal (farmer to farmer) extension services (Altieri and Toledo 2011) have been associated with the successful uptake of new land management techniques amongst smallholders (Clark et al 2011, Baird et al 2016). More broadly, access to assets and knowledge are theorised to be central to the adaptive capacity, and associated resilience, of actors in natural resource management-a key factor underpinning the achievement of land management objectives despite emergent shocks and stressors (Thiault et al 2019). For FLR, social factors, extension services and Our research questions are: which of the hypothesised environmental and social drivers have had the greatest effect on the AGB of trees established on agroforestry restoration farms? What are the causal mechanisms of the social effects? What are the implications for smallholder agroforestry, and other, FLR projects?",

To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not previously been demonstrated quantitatively using ex-post field data linking directly to biophysical outcomes. Additionally, the quantitative evidence suggests that these factors operate at both the village and household levels. Local perspectives emphasised that the broad causal mechanism for these social effects was that farmers with more resources and knowledge, and better support from village institutions, were better able to adapt their land use to emergent social-ecological shocks and stresses. This reaffirms existing theories on the importance of individual adaptive capacity and adaptive cogovernance for land management programmes (Thiault et al 2019). Our findings apply across sites in three countries. Given the need for FLR and other restoration programmes to engage rural smallholders in developing countries, we contend that our results are of relevance to the broader restoration field, and other land management interventions such as conservation and payments for ecosystem service schemes.

Tree planting can catalyse forest community reassembly in degraded landscapes where natural regeneration is slow, however, tree survival rates vary remarkably across projects. Building a trait-based framework for tree survival could streamline species selection in a way that generalizes across ecosystems, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the global restoration movement. We investigated how traits mediated seedling survival in a tropical dry forest restoration, and how traits were coordinated across plant structures. We examined growth and survival of 14 species for 2 years and measured six below-ground and 22 above-ground traits. Species-level survival ranged widely from 7.8% to 90.1%, and a model including growth rate, below-ground traits and their interaction explained more than 73% of this variation. A strong interaction between below-ground traits and growth rate indicated that selecting species with fast growth rates can promote establishment, but this effect was most apparent for species that invest in thick fine roots and deep root structures. Overall, results emphasize the prominent role of below-ground traits in determining early restoration outcomes, and highlight little above-and below-ground trait coordination, providing a path forward for tropical dry forest restoration efforts.",

Moreover, many countries and organizations have committed to develop large-scale forest landscape restoration projects as part of programmes such as the Bonn Challenge [2] and the Trillion Tree initiative (1t.org). It is therefore imperative that appropriate management interventions be applied and targeted to local conditions [3,4]. Natural regeneration is often an optimal strategy to promote the re-establishment of native species [5,6], yet in many degraded landscapes, planting trees is a necessary step in the re-establishment of local biodiversity [7]. Within such environments, survival rates can be particularly low in the early stages of tree development, and so species selection can be a key determinant of restoration outcomes [8,9]. Identifying mixtures of species that can establish and survive within harsh environmental conditions is critical to ensure effective long-term outcomes of active forest landscape restoration efforts. Moreover, increasing plant survival in restoration projects across the globe is important to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated by countries committed to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (see https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/). Despite the importance of appropriate tree species selection for the success of restoration efforts, few studies have characterized the plant traits that are most effective at promoting survival within degraded landscapes. A long history of ecological literature highlights how the performance of plants is contingent upon the expression of traits that can confer a selective advantage under a given set of environmental conditions. A range of morphological, physiological and biochemical functional traits [10] can predict tropical plant growth under different environmental conditions [11,12]. Moreover, there have been calls to use functional traits to develop species mixes for tropical forest restoration [9,13]. Additionally, integrating local knowledge of species life-history traits (e.g. successional status) when designing restoration interventions can not only improve outcomes, but also ensure that culturally and economically important species are explicitly included in the design process [14]. Yet, applying this knowledge to predict the survival of seedlings within a restoration context remains a major challenge as trait expression, survival rates and their interactions can vary significantly at these initial stages of development.",
        "7ff01b11-97f1-4b9e-ac36-44aa40c6346e": "In particular, within tropical dry forests-the second largest forested tropical biome [15] and one of the most endangered ecosystems [16]-seedlings are exposed to strong dry seasons within the first year of growth, and survival in the initial years of development is imperative to ensure that restoration is effective in this system [17,18]. Globally, tropical dry forests have been extensively deforested [19]. It is estimated that 97% of remaining tropical dry forests are threatened by climate change and human activities [20], making them a top-priority for landscape scale restoration efforts. Recent work highlights how physiological leaf traits such as water-use efficiency can be key indicators of seedling survival during initial phases of development in both tropical dry [21] and wet forests [22]. As such, the selection of species mixtures with high community-weighted water-use efficiency could potentially improve early survival rates at the community level. Increasing survival at early restoration stages has direct consequences for the development of soil organic matter [23], canopy structure [24] and subsequent recruitment of other native species [25,26]. However, by focusing only on the linear correlations with a few plant traits, these studies cannot account for the majority of the variation in species survival rates, or identify the mixtures of trait combinations likely to promote the initial survival of seedlings in the long term. Given the multitude of approaches that plants use to compete for space, light, water and nutrients within heterogeneous environments, it is rare that any single trait can directly predict tree survival rates in a given location [27]. However, certain traits can be indicative of general life-history strategies. In particular, the growth rate of trees is a well-described indicator of changes in community assembly over time, with fast-growing resource-demanding species dominating in early successional stages and being gradually replaced by slower-growing species with more efficient resource-use [28]. As such, differences between 'acquisitive' (i.e. typically fast-growing species that maximize resource capture and are sensitive to abiotic stress) and 'conservative' (i.e.",
        "4e2d6c11-08a3-4013-9af4-04bfdc4e92e9": "typically slow-growing, stress-tolerant species with higher resource-use efficiency) functional strategies (sensu [27]) may provide a useful framework for guiding species selection that leads to high establishment rates of planted seedlings within a restoration context. Indeed, in a tropical dry forest field experiment, Gerhardt [29] highlighted that within-species tree seedling survival increased with higher height increment growth rates. However, although this 'acquisitive' growth strategy may promote tree survival within early stages of succession, rapid growth can often come at the expense of more 'conservative' strategies (e.g. that can be critical for species survival in harsh dry conditions). In tropical dry forests, tree growth and survival are strongly limited by seasonal water availability [30], and species survival may be tightly linked to the successful development of deep, robust rooting systems [31]. However, while below-ground plant traits have been linked with plant vital rates (e.g. survival and growth) across terrestrial ecosystems, these traits are rarely considered when evaluating plant performance, especially in the context of restoration [32]. If investment in fast aboveground growth (i.e. acquisitive strategy) comes at the expense of plant investment in thicker absorptive fine roots and deeper supporting root systems (i.e. conservative strategy), then it may potentially limit seedling survival within tropical dry forest. Yet, until now, no study has explored the relative importance of below-ground traits relative to above-ground traits, or the trade-offs between trait combinations, that may be essential for improving species selection to promote increased survival rates within tropical dry forest restoration. In this study, we examined growth and survival of 14 native tree species (840 seedlings in total) within a tropical dry forest restoration experiment in Costa Rica. These species are common in early successional forests in the region, are inclusive of the most dominant tree families [33] and encompass a wide range of life-history and resource-use traits [34].",

By examining the interactions between trait complexes, we test the relative importance of above-versus below-ground traits, and examine how interactions between trait combinations mediate seedling survival rates. Last, we investigated if trait syndromes (i.e. fast versus slow [35]) are coordinated across above-and belowground organs, an area of open debate for tree species [36]. Ultimately, by taking a broad scope, we aim to identify a clear hierarchy of traits that should be considered in order to promote the survival of planted seedlings within tropical dry forest restoration.",
        "791df473-f3a6-4b74-b173-bd4a39d2c42d": "The selection of tree species remains a major challenge facing restoration projects in tropical dry forest. Given the harsh growing conditions, characterized by prolonged dry seasons, mortality rates can be exceptionally high in the first 2 years following seedling establishment [38,50]. Surviving this initial growth phase is key to ensure effective restoration outcomes. In this analysis, only 34% of planted seedlings survived this initial 2-year period. Yet, survival rates of different tree species ranged from 7.8 to 90.1%, highlighting that effective species selection is necessary to maximize the chances of initial seedling establishment when restoring this ecosystem type. To explain this variation in survival rates among our species, we explored a range of above-and below-ground traits. The prominent role of relative growth rate in governing initial survival emerged strongly, explaining over 40% of the variation in survival rates alone (figure 1). Specifically, species able to tolerate conditions in this degraded soil and allocate resources to rapid initial height growth consistently established quickly and tended to survive throughout the initial 2-year growth phase. These findings are consistent with evidence from both tree planting efforts [51] and natural regeneration projects [29] in Neotropical tropical dry forests, highlighting that tropical dry forest seedling growth rates can be tightly and positively linked with survival for the first few years of establishment. Whereas the growthmortality trade-off dictates that fast-growing species typically have the highest mortality rates in closed canopy forest [52], in these high light early successional environments this tradeoff does not appear to hold (also see [53]). Therefore, in early stages of tropical dry forest restoration, acquisitive growth strategies clearly promote rapid establishment and seedling survival. This suggests that integrating fast-growing species that persist naturally at early successional stages into planting mixes is a straightforward approach towards improving restoration outcomes on extensively degraded sites where there is little to no extant canopy cover. Moreover, this pattern was not driven by nitrogen-fixing species included in our study, which can have much higher growth and survival than non-fixers in regenerating tropical wet forest [54] and can have higher growth than non-fixers in tropical wet forest restoration plantings [55].",
        "7c89fd2a-1ad2-43ff-a6f1-c6b02bb5bfee": "Rather, both fixers and non-fixers were integrated along growth and survival gradients, highlighting that species with both strategies should be considered for species mixes. Indeed, ensuring that species mixes containing a wide range of functional groups with appropriate traits for a given situation can not only restore targeted ecosystem services, but also increase forest resilience to ongoing global environmental change [1]. Despite the important role of seedling growth rate in governing survival in this system, several species diverged strongly from this linear relationship, and the inclusion of functional traits considerably improved the capacity to predict overall survival rates across species. However, the importance of different traits varied considerably between above-and below-ground characteristics. Although the inclusion of above-ground traits did not significantly ( p > 0.05) affect the model fit, the inclusion of below-ground traits considerably improved the predictive accuracy of our model. Specifically, the final model including relative growth rate, the PC1 for below-ground root traits and their interaction explained 73% of the variation in survival rates across our study species. While our results indicate that below-ground traits are highly predictive of initial survival rates in this system, survival rates over longer timescales may be dictated by different suites of traits, ontogeny [56] and/or cyclical climate cycles (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a). This prominent role of belowground traits in predicting initial species survival is consistent with the idea that root investment is critical for plant survival, especially in regions with limited water availability. Indeed, both broad- [57] and fine-scale [58] studies consistently highlight the importance of root investment within arid and seasonally dry regions, as the root : shoot ratio of plants tends to increase in drier conditions. Moreover, in this tropical dry forest, species that allocated more resources below-ground (i.e. higher RMF) allocated less resources to leaf construction (i.e. higher SLA), crown development and total canopy leaf area (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). This tradeoff is consistent with observations from Panama indicating that seedling growth in tropical dry forest was maximized when more resources were invested in roots versus leaves [59].",
        "58b9dc49-2878-416e-aacc-00535882a391": "The specific nature of the relationships between root traits and species survival can provide mechanistic insights into their effects on seedling survival. Principal Component 1 for the below-ground traits correlates negatively with root depth, root diameter and root lateral extent and positively with RMF, SRL and root tissue density (figure 2). As such, the negative overall relationship between PC1 and species survival indicates that investing in thicker fine roots, and developing deeper and more laterally extensive root structures can promote species survival within the initial years of seedling growth. These patterns appear to be tightly linked to the optimization of resource capture, and observations demonstrate that early successional tropical dry forest trees in Mexico typically have deep root structures that increase water foraging capacity [60]. Moreover, all of the species in this study associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and species with thicker fine roots typically have high mycorrhizal colonization rates [61], which could directly increase root surface area for nutrient and water uptake. Our findings likely hold across the dry tropics in forests dominated by deciduous species. However, in seasonal tropical forests with communities dominated by evergreen species, which inherently allocate more biomass to roots [62], other suites of traits may better differentiate between species when predicting initial seedling survival rates. Additionally, the low sample size of our seedling harvests may have limited our ability to well resolve trait means for specific species, potentially influencing observed trait syndrome\u00d7growth rate interactions. However, our initial analysis highlights that integrating below-ground traits into restoration design is an important research direction, and further characterizing below-ground trait variation will only help to improve our understanding of this topic. We also found a strong interaction between the effects of root investment and vertical growth rate in predicting overall survival rates. That is, fast-growing species had higher survival if they also had thick fine roots and deep root structures (figure 4). This interaction between root traits and growth rate is counterintuitive as these growth traits are often considered to be associated with distinctly opposing growth strategies.",
        "cbb4c147-a5ca-489b-b851-f82e401dcaae": "Specifically, fast vertical growth is generally considered to be associated with an 'acquisitive' growth strategy, whereas the investment in thick fine roots, and allocating resources to root structure development are often considered to occur in 'conservative' species. Therefore, to maximize initial survival rates in this tropical dry forest region, and in other tropical seasonal forests with strong dry seasons when little to no rain falls for four months or more, it is essential to select species that exhibit relatively acquisitive above-ground growth, with relatively conservative root structures. Thus, assigning binary resource-use strategies (acquisitive versus conservative) at the whole-plant level may be misleading when attempting to determine the drivers of plant performance in a restoration context. Moreover, below-ground traits were largely uncorrelated with or decoupled from above-ground traits in this system (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). This finding supports growing evidence that coordination across above-and below-ground organs in tree species may be limited [36,63]. However, there was some indication that wood and root tissue densities were linked across species, a pattern that has also been observed across a broad range of Neotropical tree species [64]. Additionally, the traits tightly coupled with seedling survival in below-ground PC1 (root diameter and RMF; figure 2) were only correlated with above-ground traits in one instance. Thus, our findings suggest that despite the difficulty associated with quantifying below-ground traits, investing time into these efforts and improving our capacity to predict species-level trait values out of sample (e.g. [65]) will most likely improve the design of tropical dry forest restorations. Moreover, large-scale forest biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments have demonstrated that maximizing functional diversity in planted forests promotes higher productivity [66] and increases resilience and ecosystem services [67]. Thus, ensuring that planted species mixes are highly diverse, in terms of both above-and below-ground functional attributes, is likely to be important, and using planting mixes with high species richness is a strategy demonstrated to meet this goal [68].",

In 1995 degraded land in Kibale was protected from fire and replanted with native seedlings (39 species) at a density of 400 seedlings ha \u00c01 . Sixty-five plots (50 m \u00c2 10 m) were established in restoration areas in 2005 and 50 of these were re-measured in 2013, allowing changes to be assessed over 18 years.

If current accumulation rates continue restoration forest would reach old-growth AGB in a further 96 years. Biodiversity of degraded plots prior to restoration was low with no tree species and 2 seedling species per sample plot (0.05 ha).

Overall this restoration treatment is an effective means of restoring degraded land in the area, as can be seen from the lack of regeneration in degraded plots, which remain low-AGB and diversity, largely due to the impacts of fire and competition with grasses.",

Degraded forests and abandoned agricultural lands have the potential to recover back to higher carbon and biodiversity value forest if left to regenerate naturally. However, natural regeneration is often arrested in very heavily degraded lands (Lawes and Chapman, 2006;Paul et al., 2004). One of the major factors leading to arrested succession is the increased susceptibility of degraded forest to wildfires (Cochrane, 2003). In addition, other factors can exacerbate arrested succession in degraded areas. Seed banks are often poor following logging or agricultural cultivation, due to topsoil removal (Dupuy and Chazdon, 1998). Seed rain from surrounding forest into degraded land can also be limited, with wind dispersed seeds often not travelling large distances (Cubi\u00f1a and Aide, 2001) and animal dispersed seeds rarely found, as few forest animals pass through such areas (Holl, 1999). Thus, the distance to the nearest primary forest can determine the success of regeneration (Cubi\u00f1a and Aide, 2001). This is problematic in highly fragmented habitats where only small patches of forest remain, particularly if the species composition of such fragments is not representative of oldgrowth forest. Thus, large areas of abandoned degraded land, and their propensity for arrested succession, mean that forest restoration could play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Not only could restored forest sequester carbon, they also have the potential to aid the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Collectively these factors have increased the desirability of forest restoration, often termed Forest Landscape Restoration (Chazdon et al., 2016). Despite active management to restore forests being suggested as a potentially important method to increase terrestrial carbon storage and improve ecosystem function of tropical forests, research is sparse. In particular, very little is known about the long-term effects of forest restoration in terms of forest structure, carbon sequestration, and changes in biodiversity.",

For example, a study by Parrotta and Knowles (1999) estimated that restoration of a bauxite mine in the Amazon cost is $2500 per ha. Thus, it is important to quantify the benefits of active forest restoration to ensure restoration projects are successful enough in terms of the long-term recovery of ecosystem services to warrant the costs. To begin to address this gap in current knowledge, we undertook research in the UWA-FACE (Uganda Wildlife Authority and FACE the future foundation) rehabilitation project, in Kibale National Park, Uganda (hereafter Kibale). Since 1995 this project has been restoring abandoned agricultural land that had become dominated by invasive elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), due to repeated wildfires (UWA-FACE, 2011). Restoration activities involved protection from fire and replanting with native tree species to restore forest ecosystem functions, and enhancing biodiversity conservation (UWA-FACE, 2007, 2011). In 2005 a study was conducted by Omeja et al. (2011a) to assess AGB and biodiversity of the project 10 years after planting. Our aims in this study are twofold. Firstly, to quantify the effect of tree planting and fire management on AGB accumulation and plant species diversity over 18 years by remeasuring the study plots established in 2005. It is likely that the rate of AGB accumulation will change with increasing time after planting, as has been demonstrated in an Australian tropical forest restoration project (Paul et al., 2015). Specifically, we predict that initial AGB accumulation will be slow as planted seedlings have few photosynthesizing leaves, limiting growth, which will increase as the size of trees in the stand increases. Thus, we expect more recent AGB accumulation rates to be greater, and be more representative of rates over the coming decades. Secondly, we estimate woody plant species diversity after 18 years of restoration.",
        "bc82cd9f-32e1-41d7-808d-1b36b779ec6c": "Secondly, we estimate woody plant species diversity after 18 years of restoration. We expect that restoration activities will result in an increase in tree species diversity. Initially tree diversity will be dominated by planted tree species. However, the presence of planted trees is expected to assist natural regeneration and the shade created once a canopy develops will create more favourable conditions for seedlings of old-growth forest species to become established. Furthermore, the presence of planted trees will also encourage the movement of animals through the area and they will bring with them seeds of animal-dispersed species. Therefore, restoration will help increase tree diversity from pre-restoration levels, yet, it is likely to take longer for species composition to become similar to old-growth forest that forest structure of AGB due to the time delay in pioneer planted tree species being superseded by old-growth forest species. Here, we calculate changes in forest structure, AGB and biodiversity at two periods following forest restoration, 10 years post planting in 2005 and 18 years post planting in 2013, in Kibale National Park and compare these to nearby grassland areas that have not been restored and old-growth forest that has not been degraded.",

Few studies have evaluated the recovery trajectories of forest litterfall by simultaneously monitoring forest restoration strategies and reference ecosystems. The general objective of our study was to determine the functional recovery of an abandoned pasture under passive and active restoration, and in secondary (40-year-old) and mature (120-year-old) forest, by analyzing litterfall and its components (leaves, flowers, fruits, woody parts) over a period of five consecutive years. We determined the vegetation structure and tree species composition of these four conditions and compared 1) production of litterfall, leaves, flowers and fruits, 2) leaf litter nutrient inputs (C and N) and, 3) recovery by tree species in leaf litterfall. In five years, litterfall increased from 2.6 to 7.8 Mg ha -1 and from 3.5 to 9.1 Mg ha -1 in the passive and active restoration treatments, respectively, while it increased from 6.0 to 8.6 Mg ha -1 in the secondary forest. In the mature forest, litterfall varied around 10.0 Mg ha -1 . The reproductive component increased significantly in restoration (0.3 to 1.5 Mg ha -1 ) but remained around 0.6 Mg ha -1 in secondary and 1.3 Mg ha -1 in mature forest. Secondary and mature forests both presented correlations to monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures, indicating strong seasonality. However, litterfall production in the passive and active treatments was continuous throughout the year. Basal area and tree density were higher under active compared to passive restoration. Although the dominant tree species were similar under passive and active restoration, active restoration presented a higher forest species recovery, while the dominance of exotic grass patches persisted under passive restoration. The results suggest that litterfall production can be a useful and accurate indicator with which to evaluate the recovery of ecosystem function, while flower and fruit component can indicate reproductive recovery.",
        "6514a69a-568c-440e-bd28-fa8ac11be9bb": "Although litterfall production increased rapidly after five years, it did not present a seasonal dynamic. This is probably due to the fact that the species composition still differs from that of the reference systems. Evaluations of cloud forest restoration success should therefore include temporal assessments of vegetation structure and biodiversity recovery in relation to the reference forests in order to establish additional restoration techniques, particularly in the case of passive restoration strategies.",
        "94f28daa-8407-4bba-b461-7aad5c8c7e22": "Ambitious forest landscape restoration practices are being implemented worldwide (Romijn et al., 2019); however, the lack of monitoring of these efforts has been highlighted as a major concern since restoration is not simply about increasing forest cover, but also implies the recovery of biodiversity, forest functions and ecosystem services (Mansourian et al., 2017;Brancalion and Holl, 2020). Passive (natural regeneration) and active (i.e., mixed tree plantations) restoration strategies are increasingly utilized in attempts to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and functions. The success of these restoration strategies can generally be assessed by monitoring the recovery trajectories of selected attributes that, over time, are expected to resemble the characteristics of a reference ecosystem (Ruiz-Jaen and Aide, 2005;Wortley et al., 2013;Gatica-Saavedra et al., 2017). However, few studies make adequate comparisons of the effectiveness of both strategies, since they must be implemented at the same time, under similar initial conditions and have nearby reference ecosystems (i.e., mature or secondary forests) for comparison (Reid et al., 2018). Monitoring would also provide important information for evaluating whether or not the restoration target has been reached, or if the strategy requires some modification. Common attributes used to monitor restoration success in degraded or converted forests include changes related to the seedling and juvenile establishment, biodiversity (richness, abundance of species, life form) and vegetation structure (vegetation cover, density, basal area, height). However, recent discussions concerning the characterization of successful restoration suggest that measuring change in the ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, biotic interactions, carbon storage) or functional traits (such as shade tolerance or seed dispersal mode) would provide more valuable information regarding the trends of ecosystem function recovery (e.g., Derh\u00e9 et al., 2016;Brancalion and Holl, 2016).",
        "38fb6eba-718d-4138-84cb-e41c09976c2d": "In particular, ecological processes related to changes in net primary productivity (NPP) of the ecosystem are rarely studied (Wortley et al., 2013), although they can provide important information pertaining to the accumulation of nutrients and organic material, which are crucial components of forest functions (i.e., functional restoration; Londe et al., 2016;Jiang et al., 2019). This information can guide modifications to strategies, particularly during the initial stages following implementation of active restoration projects. Annual litterfall production and aboveground biomass increments are major indicators of NPP (Clark et al., 2001a,b). Moreover, leaf litterfall production is a fundamental process in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, as it constitutes the greatest transfer of organic matter and nutrients from vegetation to soil (e.g., Vitousek and Sanford, 1986;Sayer and Tanner, 2010). In young secondary forests recovering from pasture use, carbon cycling processes associated with litter production and decomposition are rapidly restored during succession, and occur faster than biomass or species recovery, demonstrating their potential to recover ecosystem services (Ostertag et al., 2008;Souza et al., 2019). In addition, the type of species used in the restoration strategy can influence the nutrient cycling process. For example, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in degraded areas where leguminous tree species were planted were similar to those found in native forests (Macedo et al., 2008). On the other hand, litterfall components, such as flowers and fruits, can indicate the recovery of reproductive functions, while leaf production patterns indicate the seasonality of species (Williams-Linera and Tolome, 1996;Souza et al., 2019). In this way, litterfall components not only provide information pertaining to biomass trends but also to secondary forest dynamics, such as periodicity and reproductive investment of the trees. Although litterfall is a useful indicator of ecosystem function, few studies have related litterfall dynamics to ecological restoration (Londe et al., 2016;Lanuza et al., 2018).",
        "5a5c0e86-832b-49e4-91e1-111063d733b3": "Previous investigations report that active forest restoration strategies lead to high litter production when compared to the degraded ecosystem or passive restoration, potentially accelerating the recovery of the nutrient cycles (Celentano et al., 2011;Figueira Gazell et al., 2012;Londe et al., 2016;Lorenzo and Campagnaro, 2017). A study in premontane forest in Costa Rica found that, after five years, litterfall production in a tree plantation was similar to that of the reference secondary forest and both were greater than the production recorded in trees planted in small patches and under passive restoration strategies (Celentano et al., 2011). After a decade, however, litterfall production and most nutrient inputs did not differ among active restoration treatments or secondary forest, although they were still higher than in the passive restoration plots (Lanuza et al., 2018). In addition, input from naturally regenerated trees increased between both periods (Lanuza et al., 2018), suggesting a positive effect of these strategies on tree recruitment. On the other hand, after two years in submontane forest in Brazil, litterfall production was higher in active restored plots, regardless of the planting technique (planting in rows or clusters), than it was in passive restoration plots (Lorenzo and Campagnaro, 2017). In contrast, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, litterfall production did not differ significantly among (six-year-old) restored stands with different numbers of species (Figueira Gazell et al., 2012) and between early and intermediate successional stages (Souza et al., 2019) but litterfall production was lower than in mature forest. Litterfall production and composition can be used as surrogates for identifying the functional recovery of the forest ecosystems.",

Through analysis of litterfall production and its components over five consecutive years, we evaluated the recovery of tree species composition and forest productivity under passive and active treatments and compared their recovery trajectory to those of secondary and mature cloud forests in a periurban tropical montane cloud forest landscape of Veracruz, Mexico. For this, we determined the vegetation structure and tree species composition of each condition, and compared passive and active restoration in relation to secondary and mature forests in terms of 1) production of total litterfall and its components (leaves, flowers and fruits, woody parts) and their temporal trajectories, 2) leaf litter nutrient inputs (C and N) and 3) recovery per tree species of the leaf component in the litterfall. We expected that litterfall production and nutrient content would be higher in secondary and mature forests than in the six-year-old restoration treatments, and higher in the active than in the passive treatment. In addition, since changes in the flower and fruit component of the litterfall are indicators of reproductive functional recovery of the system and trees in restoration conditions probably had not reached reproductive age, we expected a lower quantity but an increasing trend of this component in restoration conditions, being higher in active restoration. Also, the reproductive component of the litterfall would not present seasonality in restoration conditions, while in the secondary and mature forests would display seasonality. We hypothesized that differences in both litterfall production and reproductive components will be related to tree species composition and density.",

We also showed the importance of simultaneously monitor reference ecosystems, particularly an older secondary forest that might provide intermediate values in the recovery trajectories. These values are useful to verify if the restoration intervention is progressing towards the mature forest, a measure of the recovery completeness (i.e., the degree to which the indicator has reached the reference levels; Meli et al., 2017) and suggest adjustments to the restoration strategy. The applicability of our results to other sites needs further studies in other restoration conditions. However, while it is desirable to have many replicates of restoration treatments and reference forests, there is a possibility that variation in initial conditions (past land use, degradation level) and environmental factors may not allow for the most adequate comparison of recovery trajectories (Meli et al., 2017), especially when using fine-grained indicators such as litterfall components.",
        "f94cfc32-0882-4ebe-8cb0-adb0e8268ef1": "Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C 4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C 3 vs. C 4 plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (-442 g C m -2 , negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (-450 g C m -2 ). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 g C m -2 ), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C 4 pasture to C 3 afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.",
        "d0337007-fe04-4d1b-8cfe-07095b5ed388": "Tropical ecosystems account for more than half of the global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) (Beer et al., 2010), contain 40% of the carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere, and are considered to sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Grace et al., 2001). However, the current role of tropical ecosystems in terrestrial carbon sequestration remains uncertain as ongoing deforestation and associated landuse changes strongly reduce the area of tropical forests, with cropland and pasture becoming more prevalent (Fearnside 2005;Alves et al., 2009). Land-use change from tropical forest to pasture has been reported to affect ecosystem carbon budgets in the short-term through increased inter and intra-annual variations in ecosystem CO 2 fluxes and the sensitivity to seasonal drought (Priante-Filho et al., 2004;von Randow et al., 2004;Saleska et al., 2009). Moreover, one of the major longterm effects of such land-use changes is the reduced carbon sink strength of pasture ecosystems (IPCC 2007). Despite the general importance of tropical ecosystems for global climate and carbon cycling, eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements in the tropics remain scarce and thus are globally under-represented. Tropical sites represent only 10% of the global FLUXNET measurement network, with most sites located in neotropical forests and only a few in tropical pastures or other land-use types (http:/ /www.fluxnet.ornl.gov). A recent FLUXNET synthesis highlighted the importance of C 4 vegetation for terrestrial GPP, accounting for 20% of global terrestrial GPP, and emphasized the need for an expansion of observations in these scarcely covered ecosystems (Beer et al., 2010). EC flux measurements indicate that many tropical forests act as carbon sinks, which is consistent with carbon uptake inferred from long-term biometric data at some of these sites (Malhi et al., 1999;Loescher et al., 2003;Luyssaert et al., 2007;Bonal et al., 2008).",

In Brazil, a transitional forest was found to have an annual carbon budget close to equilibrium (Vourlitis et al., 2001) while a tropical savanna appeared to be a sink of carbon (Miranda et al., 1997). Published results of carbon fluxes for other land-use types in the neotropics are limited: again in Brazil, Grace et al. (1998) and von Randow et al. (2004) found indications that a tropical pasture sequestered carbon, as did Priante-Filho et al. (2004) for a pasture under conversion to afforestation. In contrast, chamber measurements by Wilsey et al. (2002) showed carbon losses from tropical pastures in Panama. It therefore remains unclear whether tropical pastures are carbon sinks or sources. Latin America has one of the highest deforestation rates in the tropics, with land predominantly converted to pasture for extensive grazing (Wassenaar et al., 2007). Few of these pastures are later used for afforestation, although this is considered an effective measure to sequester carbon and mitigate increasing CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere (FAO 2009). Malhi et al. (2002) estimated the mitigation potential of tropical afforestation at 15% of global CO 2 emissions. Afforestation of pasture may become more relevant for tropical countries in the future within the international carbon accounting of the Kyoto protocol, but this requires accurate information on the carbon sequestration potential involved. A comparative measurement design is needed to quantify carbon dynamics involved in the land-use change from pasture to afforestation, to account for confounding factors of spatial divergence and variations in meteorology (Don et al., 2009). In this study, we determined the carbon budgets of tropical pasture and native tree species afforestation at a site in Central Panama from 2007 to 2009 based on continuous measurements using two EC flux towers.",

In addition, water limitations led to strong and persistent carbon losses during the dry season that continued into the first weeks of the wet season. Due to overgrazing, carbon uptake of the pasture during the wet season was not sufficient to compensate carbon losses during the dry season. In contrast, the afforestation site persistently sequestered large amounts of carbon as measured with the eddymethod and supported by biometric observations.",

As deforestation in the tropics is expected to continue, it is critical to improve our understanding of alternative land-use types, and the impact of interactions between land use and climate on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Thus, we measured net ecosystem CO 2 fluxes of a pasture and an adjacent tropical afforestation (native tree species plantation) in Sardinilla, Panama from 2007 to 2009. The objectives of our paired site study were: (1) to assess seasonal and inter-annual variations in net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) of pasture and afforestation, (2) to identify the environmental controls of net ecosystem CO 2 fluxes, and (3) to constrain eddy covariance derived total ecosystem respiration (TER) with chamber-based soil respiration (R Soil ) measurements. We observed distinct seasonal variations in NEE that were more pronounced in the pasture compared to the afforestation, reflecting changes in plant and microbial activities. The land conversion from pasture to afforestation increased the potential for carbon uptake by trees vs. grasses throughout most of the year. R Soil contributed about 50% to TER, with only small differences between ecosystems or seasons. Radiation and soil moisture were the main environmental controls of CO 2 fluxes while temperature had no effect on NEE. The pasture ecosystem was more strongly affected by soil water limitations during the dry season, probably due to the shallower root system of grasses compared to trees. Thus, it seems likely that predicted increases in precipitation variability will impact seasonal variations of CO 2 fluxes in Central Panama, in particular of pasture ecosystems.",

They store 40% of the carbon in the terrestrial biosphere and are responsible for half of the global terrestrial gross primary production (Fisher et al., 2009;Grace et al., 2001). Climate model projections for tropical areas like Amazonia and Central America suggest rising temperatures, a reduction in the total amount of precipitation, and an increase in precipitation variability with more frequent extreme dry seasons by the end of this century (Bates et al., 2008;IPCC, 2007). A recent study by Phillips et al. (2009) suggests a large sensitivity of Amazonian ecosystems to drought, which is contrary to findings of Schwalm et al. (2010) who found only a minimal drought sensitivity of CO 2 fluxes in tropical regions. On the other hand, it is well known that variations of precipitation patterns are strongly associated with ENSO (El Ni \u00f1o Southern Oscil-lation) events, e.g. in Central Panama (Graham et al., 2006;Lachniet, 2009), but little is known on the impacts of these variations on ecosystem carbon fluxes. Thus, an improved understanding of tropical ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions such as more severe seasonal droughts and increased precipitation variability is needed. The eddy covariance technique (EC) is the established method to directly measure turbulent fluxes of trace gases between the biosphere and the atmosphere (Aubinet et al., 2000;Baldocchi, 2003Baldocchi, , 2008)). As of March 2010, 502 sites were listed in FLUXNET, the global network of eddy covariance flux tower measurements (www.fluxnet.ornl.gov), which includes a broad range of vegetation types, climates and disturbance regimes (Baldocchi, 2008). However, the distribution of these sites is still largely dominated by temperate climates on the Northern hemisphere, especially within Europe and North America, which was already noted a decade ago (Buchmann and Schulze, 1999).",

This is surprising since in Central America and the Caribbean, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland) cover approximately 41% of the total land area, making grasslands the most important land-cover along with forests (34%; EarthTrends, 2003). With ongoing deforestation and related land-use changes, the tropics are increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Land-use change is one of the most important contributors to globally increasing CO 2 concentrations, particularly in developing countries (IPCC, 2007) where deforestation is primarily driven by the demand for timber, arable land and livestock production. Following deforestation of native primary forest, the land is typically used to cultivate agricultural crops for a few years, before being converted into grasslands used for grazing (Am\u00e9zquita et al., 2008). However, only few of these often extensively used grasslands (Malmer et al., 2010) are later considered for afforestation. So far, afforestations (forest plantations), typically with non-native, fast growing or high value timber monocultures like Eucalyptus, Pinus or Tectona (Kanowski, 1997), cover only a minimal area in the tropics.",

However, our knowledge about the carbon cycling of tropical pastures and afforestations including the land-use change in between is very limited. Large uncertainties exist in particular about the sensitivity of newly established ecosystems to changes in environmental conditions (Gilmanov et al., 2010). Thus, we quantified and compared the net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) of a traditionally grazed pasture and an adjacent afforestation planted with native tree species. The objectives of our paired-sites study were: (1) to assess seasonal and inter-annual variations in NEE of a pasture and an afforestation in Panama, (2) to identify the environmental controls of net ecosystem CO 2 fluxes, and (3) to constrain eddy covariance derived total ecosystem respiration (TER) with chamber based soil respiration (R Soil ) measurements. We hypothesised that the afforestation with native tree species would be more adapted to the pronounced seasonal climate and therefore be less sensitive to variations in climate.

The larger seasonal variations of NEE in pasture compared to afforestation in Sardinilla agree with the results reported by Priante-Filho et al. (2004), while von Randow et al. (2004) reported smaller variations of NEE for pasture compared to forest in Amazonia. As dry season length is similar, non-climatic factors such as species composition or land management could be responsible for such differences.  Kljun et al. (2004).

Reforestation contributed most to carbon storage in the state-owned forest region in Xinjiang. In state-owned forest regions of Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, the dominant factors were forest fires and forest cultivation, respectively. For the enhancement of carbon sequestration capacity, a longer rotation period and a smaller timber harvest are recommended for the Yellow and Yangtze River basins.

It regulates the direction of forest resource management and promotes the preservation, cultivation, and development of natural forest resources through reclassification and rezoning of natural forests. The program prohibits commercial logging in natural forests along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River. It mandates large-scale reductions in the timber yield of state-owned forests in the above-mentioned areas and in Inner Mongolia. It accelerates forestation on treeless hills and lands where forestation is practicable. Based on pilot projects in 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities since 1998, this program was officially launched in 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in 2000. The whole program covers all the key state-owned forests in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and key state-owned forest regions in northeast China and Inner Mongolia.

In this method, every endogenous variable is treated as function of lagged values of all endogenous variables in the system, thus the single variable regression model is extended to the VAR model of multivariate time series variables. The method can be used to analyze and forecast the mutual impacts between variables in the system, and enabling the determination of leading and potential factors and quantifying their influence (Gao 2006;Cui and Wang 2010). Vector autoregression (VAR) is a unique model to analyze the linear interdependencies among multiple variables. In a VAR analysis, VAR model treats each endogenous variable as the function of lagged values of all endogenous variables in the system. Thus, simple linear regression model is extended to VAR model which is composed of multiple time series variables. Such method could forecast inter-association among time series systems, and investigate dynamic impacts of random perturbations on variable systems, consequently quantifying their respective effects. In this article, forest inventory data were used to calculate the carbon storage of forest vegetation. With natural and non-natural factors that have significant influence on forest resources as variables, the VAR model was used to explore dynamic relations among temperature, precipitation, timber harvest, pest-infected areas, fire-damaged areas, areas of cultivated forest, reforested areas, and carbon storage. The purposes of this article are to (1) reveal changing features of the vegetation carbon sink function in the area covered by the program, and (2) determine the identity and contribution of the dominant factors responsible for the regional difference of carbon storage.",

The associations between plant diversity and productivity spanning the different strata of restoration forests, in conjunction with specific factors that may impact these relationships, remain uncertain. We sampled 94 sites that encompassed conifer, mixed-wood, and broadleaved overstory types as three exemplar substrates following the reforestation of oil-sands mining sites in Alberta, Canada. We employed structural equation modeling to investigate the correlations between species diversity and aboveground biomass production spanning forest vegetation strata, while concurrently accounting for the effects of overstory composition, functional diversity/identity, soil fertility, and restoration age. We found that the relationships between species diversity and biomass were negative, or inconsequential across restoration forest strata. Overstory biomass was linked to the coniferous tree proportion and community-weighted mean of leaf nitrogen, rather than the species and functional diversity of overstory trees. Further, overstory composition, diversity, and biomass were the key features involved in the diversity and biomass of understory strata.Our results demonstrated the importance of overstory tree species composition and selection effects toward driving overstory and understory productivity in restoration forests at post-oil sands mining sites. Coniferous trees were observed to have lower leaf nutrient levels and negative impacts on the productivity and diversity of overstory and shrub layers. Therefore, it was recommended that a greater proportion of broadleaved trees should be incorporated to promote productivity and species diversity in restoration forests through the enhancement and utilization of available resources.",

In this study, we developed an age-based volume-to-biomass method to estimate the carbon storage by planted forests in China in the period of 1973-2003 based on the data from 1209 field plots and national forest inventories. The results show that the total carbon storage of planted forests was 0.7743 Pg C in 1999-2003, increased by 3.08 times since the early 1970s. The carbon density of planted forests varied from 10.6594 Mg/ha to 23.9760 Mg/ha and increased by 13.3166 Mg/ha from 1973-1976 to  1999-2003. Since the early 1970s, the planted forests in China have been always a carbon sink, and the annual rate of carbon sequestration was 0.0217 Pg C/yr. The carbon storage and densities of planted forests varied greatly in space and time. The carbon storage of Middle South China was in the lead in all regions, which accounted for 23%-36% of national carbon storage. While higher C densities (from 17.79 Mg/ha to 26.05 Mg/ha) were usually found in Northeast China. The planted forests in China potentially have a high carbon sequestration since a large part of them are becoming mature and afforestation continues to grow.",

Forest biomass accounts for approximately 90% of all living terrestrial biomass on the earth, and young forests take up CO 2 at higher rates than most other ecosystems (Dixon et al., 1994). The carbon storage in forest biomass represents the potential amount of C that is sequestered from the atmosphere when forests are managed for meeting emission targets (Brown, 1999a). Therefore, reforestation and afforestation have been included in the Kyoto Protocol as an important means to stabilize atmospheric CO 2 concentration and mitigate climate change (Schulze et al., 2000). Planted forests in the world is about 130\u00d710 6 ha in 1991 (Allan and Lanty, 1991) and the annual rates of plantation establishment during the early 1980s were estimated to be 10.5 \u00d7 10 6 ha/yr (WRI, 1992), therefore they will play an increasing role in adding the terrestrial carbon sink. Some studies estimated that planted forests in the world may take up 0.178 Pg C/yr, but high uncertainties exist because many factors, e.g. climate, soil, forest management and disturbance, affect the carbon processes (Winjum and Paul, 1997). The implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has generated further interest in the carbon sequestration through reforestation and afforestation. Many countries have been studying the rates of carbon sequestration by planted forests and the ways of using the carbon sink to substitute the reduction in fossil fuel carbon release. China is one of the countries with the largest planted forest areas in the world (Winjum and Paul, 1997).",

From the 1970s, China\u2032s government has launched national afforestation projects and construction of farmland shelterbelt networks. As a result, total forest coverage in China increased from 5.2% in 1950 to 18.21% in 2003 (Liu, 1996;Zhang et al., 2000). Previous studies have improved our understanding of the changes in biotic and ecological characteristics of planted forests, including forest volume, biomass and net primary production at local scale, but few studies have been conducted to quantify the rate of carbon sequestration by planted forest at the national scale. The carbon storage of trees and its changes can be calculated using Biomass Expansion Factors (BEFs) that convert timber volumes to dry weight (density factor) and thereafter to whole tree biomass (expansion factor) (Lehtonen et al., 2004). The forest BEFs not distinguishing between natural and planted forests are not applicable for conversion of stem volume to biomass of planted forest trees, because BEFs vary depending on forest types, growth conditions and phase of stand development (Lehtonen et al., 2004). So some studies that estimated the carbon sequestration by planted forests using the forest BEFs directly have great uncertainties. The objectives of this study are 1) to develop a volume-to-biomass method for estimating the carbon storage and sequestration of planted forests in China based on field plots data; 2) to estimate the carbon storage and sequestration of planted forests in China based on planted forest inventory data; and 3) to analyze the influence of afforestation and reforestation on carbon storage and sequestration.",

In this study, the carbon sequestration evaluated is only for the forest stand, not including the economic forest and bamboo forest.

The exotic Sonneratia apetala is widely used for the restoration of mangroves in China because of its fast growth. However, it is not clear whether S. apetala increases SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools compared with the native mangrove species. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine whether Kandelia obovata and the fast-growing mangrove species S. apetala have advantages with regard to the SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools and whether restored mangroves have SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools similar to those of original mangroves. Four sites in the Qi'ao-Dangan Provincial Nature Reserve were selected: a 15-year-old planted S. apetala forest, a 15-year-old planted K. obovata forest, a native K. obovata forest, and an unvegetated mudflat. The content and pools of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the soil were compared. Compared with mudflats, the content and pools of SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus were significantly increased by planting S. apetala. However, compared with the 15-year-old planted K. obovata, the fast-growing S. apetala showed no advantage. The content and pools of SOC and nitrogen in the 15-year-old planted S. apetala site were lower than those of native K. obovata forests.

Because of their distinctive evolutionary process, they have unique hydrology, soil, and vegetation characteristics (Alongi, 2014). Mangroves are highly productive and form one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world. Despite occupying only 0.5% of the global coastal area, mangrove forests account for 10%-15% (24 Tg C y -1 ) of the mean annual global coastal soil carbon storage (Collins et al., 2017;Duarte et al., 2013). Mangrove ecosystems, known as blue carbon, have become a research focus in recent years because of the ecological problems caused by climate change. Most of this research examines the carbon cycle-related aspects of mangroves (Chen et al., 2017;Donato et al., 2011), whereas the effects of mangrove growth on the soil, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and distribution are rarely reported. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the main nutrients in soil. They are important indicators of soil fertility and productivity, and they play a key role in regulating plant growth and nutrient cycling (Sistla, and Schimel, 2012). These elements circulate continuously between the layers of the soil and maintain the stability and balance of the entire ecosystem. A close relationship occurs between plant and soil characteristics (Fujita, Van, and Witte, 2013). The content of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the soil directly reflects soil fertility and indirectly reflects plant nutrition (Agren, Wetterstedt, and Billberger, 2012). For a long time, the soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents have been important parameters that increase understanding of the interactions between plant communities and soil nutrient characteristics, and these elements have been used to recognize the response of ecological processes to global change (Yu et al., 2018;Yue et al., 2017).",

These indicators are sensitive to changes in soil quality; in the process of vegetation restoration, they are an important aspect for understanding the degree of degradation and recovery of ecosystems (Yu et al., 2018). Because of anthropogenic activities, many mangrove forests have been destroyed worldwide (Alongi, 2014). Since the 1990s, China has established many mangrove reserves and undertaken a number of mangrove restoration projects (Chen et al., 2009). Qi'ao Island in Zhuhai is a representative mangrove area in China. The native mangroves in this area were destroyed in the last century. Prior to 2000, the intertidal shoals were invaded and occupied by Spartina alterniflora, a marsh grass. Since 2000, the municipal government has implemented restoration programs to control S. alterniflora populations by planting mangroves on Qi'ao Island. Currently, S. alterniflora is being effectively controlled, and a large area of mangroves has been restored (increasing from 32 to 700 ha). Sonneratia apetala is the main choice for afforestation in the mangrove restoration project of Qi'ao Island because of its strong adaptability and fast growth. In recent years, with the rapid growth and expansion of S. apetala, some debate has occurred as to whether S. apetala has the same effect as the native species in terms of soil carbon sinks and nutrients, whether it will become an invasive species, and thus whether it should be widely used in mangrove restoration (Ren et al., 2009;Ren et al., 2010).",

However, in Zhanjiang, China, S. apetala has been reported to have a higher total biomass but less soil carbon reserves than the native mangrove species (Lu et al., 2014). Nitrogen and phosphorus in mangrove ecosystems, especially in soils, play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation community changes affect the distribution and storage of these elements (Feng et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2016). Studies have shown that restored mangroves often exhibit low geochemistry (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2012). Therefore, determining the content of nutrient elements (nitrogen and phosphorus) in mangrove soils after restoration is critical to understanding the role of nutrients in mangrove forests. To elucidate the effect of mangrove restoration on soil condition, it is necessary to determine whether the carbon and nutrient banks in the soil will increase after the restoration of mangroves (Shi et al., 2016). In this study, four different sites were selected on Qi'ao Island, Guangdong Province, China, to compare the content and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, and phosphorus. The main objectives of this study were determining whether Kandelia obovata and the fast-growing mangrove species, S. apetala, at the same forest age, have advantages with regard to SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools and determining whether the restored mangroves have SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools similar to those of the original mangroves.",

It has been widely promoted in the restoration of mangroves in the coastal areas of SE China and has achieved good ecological, economic, and social benefits (Chen et al., 2014). In this study, the height of native K. obovata was found to be about 8.8 m, that of 15-year-old planted K. obovata was only about 6 m, and that of S. apetala planted in the same period reached up to 12 m. In a planting experiment of S. apetala and native S. caseolaris, the height, ground diameter, and DBH growth of S. apetala were 39.4%, 26.1%, and 26.5% higher than that of native S. caseolaris and 60.6%, 37.0%, and 43.2% higher than that of S. alba, respectively. Another study found that S. apetala grew almost 1.5 times and more than three times faster than S. caseolaris and S. ovata, respectively (Li, and Zheng, 1995), showing remarkably rapid growth characteristics. This characteristic was also observed when S. apetala was compared with other native mangroves in China. Two years after planting, S. apetala introduced from Leizhou Peninsula to Xinxi Town had become a forest, and the canopy was completely closed, with growth rates of 5.16, 4.76, and 12.5 times the height, ground diameter, and crown width of the native K. obovata in the nearby control area (Chen et al., 2003). This study showed that a 15-year-old planted S. apetala was comparable to the native K. obovata in both the biomass of a single tree and total biomass.",

Ren et al. (2010) reported that with an increase in the restoration years of S. apetala, the diversity value of understory vegetation gradually decreased. Because of invasion by S. apetala, the density of native K. obovata in Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, and Qiongshan decreased from 2812 idm/ha, 2473 idm/ha, and 2899 idm/ha in 2006 to 37 idm/ha, 51 idm/ha, and 111 idm/ha in 2009, respectively (Ren et al., 2009). Compared with the mudflats, 15-year-old planted S. apetala, native K. obovata, and 15-year-old planted K. obovata all improved the content of SOC, TN, and TP. The increase in SOC and TN in mangrove soil mainly comes from allochthonous materials, plant litterfall, and root tissue (Zhou et al., 2007). The high yield of litter from fast-growing S. apetala can accelerate the transfer of plant biomass to the soil and the accumulation of organic carbon and TN in the soil. However, this study found that the organic carbon content in the soil of 15-year-old planted S. apetala was significantly lower than that of native K. obovata, and no obvious advantage occurred compared with the 15-year-old planted K. obovata. This may be because of the relatively low C:N ratio of the litter of S. apetala, which promotes the decomposition of microorganisms and reduces the burial of carbon in the soil (Xiong, Liao, and Wang, 2018;Zhou et al., 2007). The SOC and TN contents in the two mangrove plantations were significantly lower than those in native K. obovata.",

Compared with the native K. obovata, 15-year-old planted S. apetala and 15-year-old planted K. obovata had higher TP content. The phosphorus in soil mainly comes from rock weathering, and the content is influenced by soil parent material, land use type, and biogeochemical processes. The decrease in the TP content of native K. obovata may be due to the increase in the plant community richness with succession, which leads to an increase in the demand for phosphorus for plant growth. In addition, the lower pH value in the native K. obovata allows inorganic phosphorus to bind to aluminum in the soil, thus reducing the phosphorus cycle in the soil (Carrino-Kyker et al., 2016). The main reason for the low phosphorus content in the mudflats is the lack of plants, which leads to a lack of inputs from root exudates and a low biochemical cycle (Gao et al., 2014). Mangroves play an important role in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from tidal waters (Zhang et al., 2010). The C:N ratio of marine microalgae is relatively low, whereas the C:N ratio of plant litter is relatively high; the C:N of sediments also reflects the source of organic matter to some extent (Xiong, Liao, and Wang, 2018). In this study, the C:N in the soil of the three mangroves was higher than that of the mudflats, indicating that mangrove plants made a greater contribution to soil organic matter. A higher C:N content in the soil is conducive to the further storage of organic carbon in the mangrove soil.",

However, compared with the native K. obovata, the SOC and TN pools of the 15-year-old planted S. apetala were lower and were similar to the lower biomass of the 15-year-old planted K. obovata. Ren et al. (2009) found that the biomass and SOC pool of S. apetala increased gradually with forest age. However, they assumed that the soil bulk density was fixed and did not assess the effect of forest age on soil bulk density. In addition, they did not compare the carbon pool between restored S. apetala and mudflats (Ren et al., 2009); therefore, the enhancement effect could not be evaluated. A 66-year chronology study of blue carbon in the mangrove forests of French Guiana showed that the carbon sink capacity of the mangroves decreased with an increase in recovery years (Walcker et al., 2018). In Hainan province, China, the carbon pool of 15-year-old planted S. apetala soil was only 20.59 kg/m 2 , which was significantly lower than that of native Ceriops tagal (27.77 kg/m 2 ), Aegiceras corniculatum (29.17 kg/m 2 ), and Rhizophora stylosa (26.15 kg/ m 2 ) (Xin et al., 2014). The well-developed root system of S. apetala reduced the soil bulk density, which may be one of the reasons why the carbon and nitrogen pools in the soil were lower than those of other mangroves (Xin et al., 2014). Mangrove soil carbon pools are greatly influenced by vegetation type (Nordhaus, Wolff, and Diele, 2006).",

Furthermore, plant species determine the type, activity, and number of soil microorganisms that are involved in the decomposition of SOC (Nordhaus, Wolff, and Diele, 2006). The level of the SOC pool in this study was significantly lower than the average SOC pool reported in China within the range of 0-100 cm (Wang et al., 2010). The structure of mangroves is time-and space-dependent, and the difference in soil carbon reserves may be caused by the spatial changes and different forest ages of mangroves (Liu et al., 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to conduct more detailed sampling and analysis of the SOC pool of mangroves. Besides taking the different species of mangroves into account, the forest age of mangroves should also be considered, especially that of the young, restored mangroves (Feng et al., 2019). There is an urgent need to publicize the ecological and economic value of mangroves and to understand their recovery mechanisms. Research shows that a mixed plantation sequestered more carbon in sediment than monocultures, presumably because of a better developed pneumatophore system (Chen et al., 2012). In addition to planting methods, the selection of tree species is also an important consideration in mangrove restoration. Non-native species are often used in large-scale forest restoration, but this can lead to ecological problems (Ren et al., 2009). Therefore, native species should be used whenever possible in mangrove restoration, and later ecological monitoring should be strengthened even if non-native species are used in some places.",

However, the quantitative understanding of ANR ecosystem service benefits is very limited. We conducted a comprehensive field manipulation experiment to evaluate the ANR potentials. We quantified and compared key ecosystem services including surface runoff, sediment yield, dissolved organic carbon export, plant diversity, and aboveground carbon accumulation of ANR of secondary forests dominated by Castanopsis carlesii to that of Chinese fir and C. carlesii plantations. Our results showed that ANR of C. carlesii forest reduced surface runoff and sediment yield up to 50% compared with other young plantations in the first 3 years and substantially increased plant diversity. ANR also reduced the export of dissolved organic carbon by 60-90% in the first 2 years. Aboveground biomass of the young ANR forest was approximately 3-4 times of that of other young plantations, while aboveground biomass of mature ANR forests was approximately 1.4 times of that of mature Chinese fir plantations of the same age. If all Chinese fir plantations in China were replaced by ANR forests, potentially 0.7 Pg more carbon will be stored in aboveground in one rotation (25 years).

Forest ecosystems provide a number of important ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005), such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, and soil and water conservation. However, it is generally agreed that ecosystem services provided by plantations do not match those of original natural forests (Chazdon, 2008). Plantation management practices differ in their effect on ecosystem services. Therefore, a major effort of plantation management focuses on maximizing ecosystem services (Chazdon, 2008). China manages the greatest acreage of monoculture plantations in the world, ~70 \u00d7 10 6 ha by 2013 (State Forestry Administration, 2014). Most of the forest plantations were originally natural forests that were directly or indirectly (i.e., converted to other land uses in the past) converted to plantations (Thomson, 2009). Chinese fir, Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Taxodiaceae), is the most important plantation tree species by area both in China and the globe, contributing 17 \u00d7 10 6 ha or 24% of the forest plantations in China and 6.3% of the globe (Del Lungo et al., 2006). Chinese fir is widely planted because of its high growth rate, with an average annual increment in height, diameter, and volume of 1 m, 1 cm, and 1 m 3 , respectively (Li, 1992), and high wood quality desirable for furniture and constructions (Duan et al., 2016).

Soil erosion and the subsequent sediment transport through runoff is an important environmental problem for its effects on water quality and on organic carbon transport (Liu et al., 2008). Some forest management practices such as land clearing, and road and trail construction can accelerate erosion processes, especially in regions with rough topography (Sidle et al., 2006). The distribution of Chinese fir plantations concentrates on the humid and hilly southeastern China (Zhou et al., 1981) where the potential of erosion and sediment production is among the highest in China (Lal, 1990). A total area of 870,000 km 2 , 74% of the total area of Southern China Hilly Region, was designated as \"Erosion Survey Zone,\" with an average erosion rate of ~3,420 t km \u00c02 yr \u00c01 , that requires erosion control measures (Liang et al., 2008). A recent global assessment concludes that primary forests are irreplaceable for sustaining tropical biodiversity and large-scale forest inventories reveal positive effects of tree diversity on productivity (Gibson et al., 2011). Regionally, a recent study highlights the importance of establishing mixed-species plantations for diversity conservation and improvement of ecosystem functioning in subtropical China (Yang et al., 2013). However, several studies have reported decreasing biodiversity with increases in plantation area in tropical and subtropical China (Williams, 2015;Zhai et al., 2014). Thus, enhancing biodiversity in forest plantations should be of high priority in forest management, particularly in southeastern China. Forest ecosystems accounting for more than 70% of global terrestrial carbon are the most important terrestrial carbon sink (Dixon et al., 1994;Litton et al., 2007;Pan et al., 2011).",

However, the effectiveness of managing forest plantations for carbon sequestration has been challenged (Law et al., 2003;Schulze et al., 2000) and its success largely depends on the ecological understanding of the forests (Chazdon, 2008). Assisted natural regeneration (ANR) or near-natural regeneration is a simple and inexpensive practice for converting degraded lands to more productive forests (Shono et al., 2007). Through minimizing barriers to natural regeneration such as soil degradation, competition with weedy species, and recurring disturbances by fire, grazing, and wood harvesting, ANR is applied to accelerate, but not to replace, natural regeneration (Shono et al., 2007). ANR has been practiced in several countries in Asia for approximately four decades (Ganz & Durst, 2003;Shono et al., 2007) and has been known in China for more than five decades (Sannai, 2003;Shao et al., 1960;Wang & Guan, 1958;Yao & Wang, 1988). The exact practices of ANR vary from one location to another. While there is not a unified definition of ANR, the most fundamental practices of ANR are protecting and facilitating the growth of parent trees inherently present in the area and their regenerations, rather than establishment of entire new monoculture plantations (Dugan et al., 2003;Shoo & Catterall, 2013). In China, based on site quality there are two major types of ANR. In the degraded areas, the site is preserved without any management for several years and management practices such as weeding and thinning are Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences 10.1002/2017JG004267 applied only after the vegetation has substantially recovered (Dugan et al., 2003;Li, 1985).",

ANR is distinctively different from traditional management of Chinese fir plantations, in which slash burning is applied followed by site preparation (tilling strips/the entire field or digging trenches/pits) prior to planting Chinese fir seedlings. Then weeding is conducted twice a year for the first 3 years, thinning is conducted at around 8 years, and finally, the plantation is harvested at the age of approximately 25-50 years, followed by another cycle of planting (Yang, 1998). Despite of the great environmental potentials, ANR is not widely applied across the globe, possibly due to lack of demonstrated positive results (Shono et al., 2007). Several studies have reported that ANR enhances biodiversity, forest productivity, tree growth, and carbon sequestration (Brown et al., 1996;Chazdon et al., 2016;Poorter et al., 2016;Stone, 2009). However, to date, almost all the studies were based on comparisons between existing forests with assumed similar geological, morphological, and pedological settings and land use history. The lack of manipulation studies with a rigorous experimental design cannot rule out the effects of factors other than differences in forest management. To quantitatively and directly evaluate the effects of ANR on key ecosystem services, in the current study, we present results from a forest manipulation experiment using experimentally established forest stands in combination with data from a mature ANR forest dominated by C. carlesii and a mature Chinese fir plantation in the same site to explicitly test the effects of ANR on forest carbon storage, plant diversity, and watershed erosion protection.",

However, this approach has contributed to serious ecological problems, including soil erosion, decreases in soil nutrient content, and reduced biodiversity (He et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2013). With recent policyguided demand for higher production levels, economic viability, and ecological services, including carbon sequestration, there has been a shift to the cultivation of mixed plantations of economically and ecologically valuable species (Piotto et al., 2010;Hvistendahl, 2012;Puettmann et al., 2015). Studies in temperate and tropical regions have shown that mixed-species plantations can improve carbon sequestration by soil or biomass (Parrotta, 1999;Resh et al., 2002;Wang et al., 2009;Forrester et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2014). Ewel et al. (2015) found that a steeply increasing growth differential between mixed stands and monocultures may account for the inferred complementarity. Other studies have shown that broadleaf tree species mixing with coniferous tree species (1) promotes the growth of the planted trees and increases overall stand productivity compared with pure stands (Binkley, 2003;Nord-Larsen and Meilby, 2016) via improving capture, supply, or resource use efficiency (i.e. light, nutrient and water) (Kelty, 2006;Pretzsch et al., 2015;Chamagne et al., 2017); (2) positively affects litter quantity and quality (Wang et al., 2013); and (3) improves the nutrient balance (Thelin et al., 2002).",

In contrast, trees take much longer to develop their crowns and small differences in tree crown architectural properties could accumulate year after year to have much larger effects as the stand canopy develops, and forest ecosystems require a long time and large areas to be treatment experiment (Scherer-Lorenzen et al., 2005). To date, however, the effects on longterm forest management of introducing non-N 2 -fixing broadleaf tree species into pure coniferous plantations remain largely unclear. Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) is one of the two most important coniferous species for timber production, carbon storage, and other ecological services in subtropical China (Zeng et al., 2011). The amount of forest area planted with this species has increased greatly, reaching > 17.39 million hectares and representing 8.92% of the total forest area of China (Kuang et al., 2008;SFA, 2010). The desirable features of this species include its fast growth, high yield, variable light tolerance, and drought resistance. However, pure Masson pine plantations also have lower biodiversity and soil fertility, cause extensive habitat loss and soil erosion, and thus increase the vulnerability of these forests to pests and diseases, ultimately compromising ecosystem functions. To address the sustainability requirement of forest management, even-or uneven-aged mixed broadleaf and coniferous tree species plantations are currently preferred. Castanopsis hystrix Miq. is a large evergreen member of the Fagaceae family and a valuable indigenous tree species in the evergreen broadleaf forests of subtropical China (He et al., 2013).",

Belowground carbon storage is the largest carbon pool in forest ecosystems, second only to aboveground biomass (Sharma et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2012). Protecting and enhancing soil carbon stock is a global challenge. Silvicultural practices can have marked effects on soil carbon stock (Wang et al., 2013) and the soil carbon cycle because tree species and forest stand structures alter light, temperature, and moisture patterns as well as the input of organic material. Forest management is a strong determinant of these processes, with large changes resulting from a shift from pure to mixed plantations. Most studies have shown that aboveground organic matter and carbon storage increase in mixed-species plantations; however, their impact on soil carbon stock is controversial. Some studies have shown that soil carbon stock is increased in mixed-species plantations because of an increase in organic matter input (aboveground and roots) (Yang et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2012); however, others have observed few effects or even decreases (Raich et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2009). These inconsistent findings suggest that soil carbon storage reflects the inputs of plant litter and other organic detritus and that organic matter decomposition is controlled by biotic (tree traits and soil microbial communities) and abiotic (soil chemical and physical properties) factors (You et al., 2014(You et al., , 2016)). Thus, despite a much improved understanding of the effects of mixed-species plantations on soil carbon stock, little is known about the effects of management practices based on mixedspecies plantations.

Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers).

The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation.

Carbon sequestration potential of areas recovering from harvests and secondary growth on abandoned agricultural land on the planet is estimated to be 4.4 Pg C y -1 . Moreover, by stopping deforestation and recovering degraded areas, 120 Pg C could be sequestered between 2016 and 2100 (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017). Only in the Latin America, second-growth forests could sequester 8.48 Pg C over 40 years, which could offset all the carbon released in the region by fossil fuel and industrial activities from 1993 to 2014 (Chazdon et al., 2016). Thus, through proper land management and implementation of policies, society can probably still mitigate climate change and its devastating consequences (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017;Chazdon et al., 2016). Based on that, during the 2014 United Nations Climate Summit, 30 countries have committed to restore a total of 350 million hectares by 2030 aiming to mitigate climate change and to preserve biodiversity and water supply (Holl, 2017). However, fulfilling this huge forest restoration demand while maximizing carbon sequestration and reestablishing other environmental services provided by forests, in a practical and cheap way is not an easy task (Holl, 2017). Forest dynamic is complex to rebuild and it affects and is affected by many factors, from implementation to establishment of a mature stage (Holl, 2017). In the tropics, restoring forests is even more complex due to its climate and greater biodiversity, so studying the most applicable restoration methods and assessment procedures in the several different situations is crucial to understand and control this complex environment (Durigan and Melo, 2006;Rodrigues et al., 2009). The Atlantic Forest is one of the tropical forest ecosystems in Brazil, the first threatened one since the Europeans settled in the country, and after that, deforestation and fragmentation have jeopardized the biome through its entire extension.",

It was estimated that 40% of its species are endemic, which means 8,567 species (Myers et al., 2000). Besides, fragmentation affects about 91% of the remaining Atlantic Forest fragments (P\u00fctz et al., 2014) and about 46% of what is left is within 100 m or less from fragment edges; therefore, under strong edge effect (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Due to this fragmentation and consequent edge effect, the Atlantic Forest lost around 69 Tg C (\u00b114 Tg C) between 2005 and 2014, equivalent to 9-24% of the total annual carbon loss associated with global tropical deforestation (P\u00fctz et al., 2014). In addition to these issues, the Atlantic Forest's ability to recover from a disturbance may be drastically reduced after years of excessive exploitation (Tambosi et al., 2014;Poorter et al., 2016;MMA, 2017). Tambosi et al. (2014) found that 85% of the Atlantic Forest has low resilience capacity and that only 5% can be considered a good biodiversity source for the colonization of other areas. Poorter et al. (2016) mapped resilience in the tropical forests of South America and found that the least resilient areas are within the Atlantic Forest. This evidences that these lands need a more effective conservation policy, including the adaptive management of degraded natural forests and the restoration of deforested areas. Resilience is a key factor to be considered in the selection of the most suitable restoration method (Tambosi et al., 2014;Ferreira et al., 2015;Poorter et al., 2016;Sansevero et al., 2017;C\u00e9sar et al., 2018).",

Local resilience means that the site has good environmental conditions including soil (structure and nutrients) and climate (precipitation and temperature) to foster natural regeneration. Landscape resilience is about the potential the lands surrounding the restoration sites have to serve as source of propagules promoting genetic flux and colonization of adjacent areas (Johnstone et al., 2016). If local and landscape resilience are harmed beyond a certain point, it may be very difficult to re-establish forests naturally, leading to a new stable state different from the previous one (Campoe et al., 2014;Poorter et al., 2016). In the case the area is still resilient, it is possible to restore it through the process called passive restoration, in which the only action necessary is to fence the area to isolate it from disturbing factors (Wadt, 2003;C\u00e9sar et al., 2018). To restore areas that need human interventions, other techniques are employed, such as the assisted restoration and active restoration (Ferreira et al., 2015;C\u00e9sar et al., 2018;Osuri et al., 2019). The assisted restoration is recommended when the area is still resilient, but some interventions are needed. In these cases, techniques are used to benefit the desired species while hampering the development of others, such as weeds, that may compete with tree species (Brachiaria, for example, an invasive exotic grass common in pastures in the region). As part of this method, natural regeneration from the soil seed bank is stimulated to germinate and grow, and a few seedlings are planted to promote fast occupation of the area, avoid weed competition and increment local biodiversity (Rodrigues et al., 2009;Brancalion et al., 2015).",

In real life, resilience is a gradient, not a categorical measure, which makes selecting the best restoration method a complex task. For this reason, studies comparing restoration methods are much needed. Gardon et al. (2020) pointed out that only 8% of the Brazilian forestrestoration related studies compared passive and active restoration in similar conditions and at the same time. In these studies (Ferreira et al., 2015;C\u00e9sar et al., 2018), only aboveground biomass was assessed. This is not surprising, given the fact that it was only in 2003 that biomass started to be studied in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest. This consists of important knowledge in forest restoration ecology in Brazil since biomass is one of the most important drivers of forest succession (Lohbeck et al., 2015;Toledo et al., 2018;Gardon et al., 2020). Thus, the lack of both adequate biomass sampling and paired comparisons of active and passive methods were pointed out as the main knowledge gaps in the forest restoration science (Gardon et al., 2020).

Because of the increasing extent of such degraded lands and desire for these areas to fulfill conservation and ecosystem functions, it has become important to assess mechanisms that accelerate reforestation. In situations where site conditions limit tree establishment, one option to facilitate reforestation is to establish plantations of fast-growing noninvasive trees that ameliorate site conditions and promote the growth of indigenous trees. To quantify the effect of distance and isolation from seed sources on the regeneration of indigenous trees, we evaluated tree species richness and stem density in four pine plantations surrounded by natural forest within Kibale National Park, Uganda, and one isolated pine plantation surrounded by agriculture near Kibale. Tree regeneration in these plantations was compared to that in natural forest and to an anthropogenic grassland similar to those upon which the plantations were established. Tree species richness and stem density were negatively correlated with distance to the plantation edge. The grassland had lower tree species richness and stem density than the isolated plantation, which had lower species richness and stem density than the plantations within Kibale. Leguminous species dominated tree regeneration in the isolated plantation and grassland, whereas small-seeded animaldispersed species dominated regeneration in plantations adjacent to forest. We suggest that these differences are due to decreased seed dispersal across large distances or unfavorable habitats (e.g., grasslands) and to greater disturbance (e.g., fire) in the isolated plantation and grassland than in plantations within the National Park. This study demonstrates that forest reestablishment can be faster if plantations are established than if grasslands are left to recover without management. However, differences within and among plantations can lead to very different communities with respect to species composition, species richness, and stem density.",

Concomitant with these changes is an increasing demand from developed countries for tropical timber and agricultural products (Brown and Lugo 1994;Naughton-Treves and Chapman, in press). Consequently, forests have been converted rapidly to pasture and agricultural land. Between 1990 and1995, 12.7 \u03eb 10 6 ha of tropical forest were being converted each year, representing an annual rate of loss of tropical forests of 0.7% (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 1999). Furthermore, forested lands transformed for agriculture and pasture are frequently abandoned after a few years of use due to soil nutrient depletion and/or invasion by weeds and other pests and pathogens (Brown andLugo 1994, Dobson et al. 1997). Forest cover can return to some abandoned areas within years to a few decades through natural succession (Reiners et al. 1994). However, forest succession Manuscript received 24 January 2001; accepted 24 January 2001. (Manuscript originally submitted 4 October 1999.) often occurs at a much slower rate (Brown andLugo 1994, Cohen et al. 1995). Succession can be considered arrested (analogous to the inhibition model of Connell and Slayter [1977]) when it does not proceed within several decades. Arrested succession resulting from both anthropogenic and natural causes has been reported throughout the tropics, including Brazil (Nepstad et al. 1991), Colombia (Aide and Cavelier 1994), Ecuador (Zahawi and Augspurger 1999), Sri Lanka (Ashton et al. 1997), Singapore (Corlett 1991), and Uganda (Chapman et al. 1999). For example, in Sri Lanka, Cohen et al.",

(1995) found that, after forest clearance, the fern, Dicranopteris pectinata, and frequent fires inhibited rain forest regeneration. Similarly, in Panama, Brokaw (1983) found sapling density was reduced in dense thickets of the terrestrial bromeliad Aechmea magdalenae. Many factors have been suggested to lead to arrested succession, including a lack of tree seeds or resprouts, high seed or seedling mortality (Cohen et al. 1995, Nepstad et al. 1996, Ashton et al. 1997; but see Aide and Cavelier 1994), inhospitable abiotic (e.g., light, temperature, water, moisture, pH, or nutrients) and biotic site conditions (e.g., lack of mycorrhizal or bacterial symbionts or high predation or disease attack; Janos 1980, Corlett 1991, Guariguata et al. 1995, Nepstad et al. 1996, Otsamo et al. 1996, Johnson and Wedin 1997), competitive dominance of invasive herbs and shrubs (Brokaw 1983, Putz andCanham 1992), and fire (Kellman 1980, Uhl andKauffman 1990). In regions that receive little rainfall or where flammable biomass accumulates during a dry season, if fire is not suppressed, forest regeneration is typically not initiated. Under such circumstances, human intervention may be required to release this arrested state of succession and facilitate reforestation. One frequently suggested option to rehabilitate degraded areas is to suppress fire and plant an initial crop of fast-growing trees (Brown and Lugo 1994, Parrotta et al. 1997, Evans 1999).",
        "2ba75fcf-eb25-4017-b785-fdfe07d8f977": "1997, Evans 1999). These trees can promote seed dispersal by attracting dispersers and ameliorate site conditions leading to increased seed germination and seedling establishment of native trees (Lugo 1992, Parrotta 1993). Subsequently, the plantation trees could be harvested for profit or left to senesce, leaving a native tree community. If the plantation is to be harvested, a method must be used to reduce the impact of the harvest on the regenerating native trees or the reforestation process may be substantially set back. Such reduced impact methods are not typically used in logging operations. This study investigated the potential use of tree plantations to facilitate regeneration of indigenous trees in successionally arrested grasslands, focusing on how characteristics of the plantations and native species could determine the type of regeneration occurring. We considered three components that may affect tree regeneration in an area: (1) location within plantations (i.e., small-scale distance to plantation edge), (2) largescale distance and habitat between seed sources and plantations, and (3) dispersal mode of tree species. Location within plantations may be important because dispersers (e.g., primates, birds, wind) differ in their abilities to carry seeds into plantations and thus may determine regeneration success of native tree species within plantations (Parrotta 1993, Kuusipalo et al. 1995, Parrotta et al. 1997). On a larger scale, plantations may have limited regeneration of animal-dispersed trees when they are not adjacent to seed sources but are surrounded by landscapes serving as barriers to animal dispersers (da Silva et al. 1996, Bierregaard andStouffer 1997). For example, particular dispersers of forest tree seeds may be wide-ranging but may refuse to cross even small grassland gaps (Tucker andMurphy 1997, Duncan andChapman 1999).",
        "8e925346-270d-48e5-8393-0f20172d4d44": "Further, depending on their dispersal mode (e.g., animal, wind) and seed size, species vary in the distances to which the majority of their seeds are moved from parent trees (Howe 1990, Parrotta 1993). With respect to animal-dispersed seeds, morphological constraints often limit small animals from ingesting and moving large seeds (Wheelwright 1985). Thus, dispersal of large-seeded species is limited by the movement patterns of large-bodied animals. Dispersal may also depend on how attractive particular sites within the plantation are to dispersers. For example, understory plants may act as focal points of regeneration for species dispersed by animals attracted to fruits of these understory plants. Factors, such as distance to seed sources or availability of understory plants, may differ among sites within a region and lead to variability in tree species composition, species richness, and stem density among sites. The goal of this study was to determine if pine plantations established in abandoned anthropogenic grasslands in Kibale National Park, Uganda, encouraged native tree establishment and to compare this regeneration with unplanted grassland and natural forest. Specifically, we explored the impacts that distance into plantations and distance and isolation from seed sources had on levels of regeneration. We predicted that plantations would facilitate forest reestablishment as they could attract seed dispersers and ameliorate site conditions hostile to regenerating trees. Increasing smallscale distance into plantations' interiors and large-scale distance and isolation of plantations from seed sources were predicted to impact negatively regeneration; however, the influence of distance and isolation on regeneration was expected to differ depending on the dispersal strategy of the tree species. While the limiting factors to regeneration in the grasslands were not determined in this study, fire and competition with aggressive grasses and shrubs (Chapman and Chapman 1999, Chapman et al. 1999;Naughton-Treves and Chapman, in press) occur in other locations within Kibale and were expected to limit regeneration in grasslands in this study.",
        "1730b450-2a73-4983-9fe0-b638a6a985b1": "It should be noted that while four plantations within the park were examined, only one isolated plantation of comparable age and plantation species was accessible. Comparisons between the Kibale plantations and isolated plantation are still useful especially for situations similar to those found in Kibale. Such situations are likely common in the tropics as plantations are often isolated from forests since they are planted for economic purposes close to urban areas or businesses (e.g., tea plantations) for fuelwood or for environmental purposes in areas already deforested (e.g., damaged watersheds).",
        "277ca5d3-1b25-4f34-b960-29b8f55d83bb": "In severely degraded areas where forest succession is slower than desired by forest managers, plantations of fast-growing trees can facilitate establishment and growth of indigenous tree species (Lugo 1992, Parrotta 1993, Parrotta et al. 1997, Harrington 1999). Our study demonstrated that this management method could be used for landscapes similar to those found in Kibale. While all five plantations still differed in species composition and stem density from forest, all plantations had higher tree species richness and stem density than anthropogenic grassland. These results suggest that establishment of these plantations facilitated forest regeneration in grasslands more quickly than grassland left to regenerate through natural succession. However, not all plantations had equal amounts of regeneration. Several findings from this study have implications for use of plantations to encourage forest reestablishment on degraded lands. These include: (1) the effect of small-scale distance from plantation edge (distance effect); (2) the effect of large-scale distance and habitat between seed sources and plantations (isolation effect); (3) the effect of understory plants (understory plant effect); and (4) variability among plantations at the same site. We found a negative correlation between distance from plantation edge and density of trees in different size classes and dispersal types in both Nykatojo and Oruha plantations. Similar effects have been observed elsewhere (Parrotta 1993, Hardwick et al. 1997, Parrotta et al. 1997). For example, Parrotta (1993) found that most species dispersed into a plantation had seed sources within 100 m, although some bird-or mammaldispersed species were carried more than 200 m. In our study, the strength of this relationship between abundance and distance differed among common species.",
        "9f43abdf-fc0a-4b28-a63c-ad697da864c0": "Small-seeded animal-dispersed species tended to show a strong distance effect with decreasing density as distance increased (C. africana and D. abyssinica in Nykatojo), but one such species (C. durandii in Nykatojo) showed only a weak decrease in density with increasing distance. Two species with reproductive adults in plantations showed little or no distance effect (C. odorata and M. dura in Oruha), but A. grandibracteata in Nykatojo had reproductive individuals within the plantation and still showed a strong distance effect. It is unclear why M. dura and A. grandibracteata (both legumes with similar fruit and seed morphology) differed in how their densities changed with distance. It is also unclear why the two Celtis species that have very similar fruits and seeds had different densities with increasing distance. These results suggest forest reestablishment will occur faster in regions that have many species with densities that are little affected by distance from plantation edge than in regions that have many species with densities that decrease rapidly with increasing distance from plantation edge. Characteristics that confer the ability to colonize throughout plantations could include effective dispersal and fast maturity so that dispersal within plantations begins quickly. Understanding which species and which characteristics of those species facilitate colonization far into plantations will assist in designing plantations to promote regeneration. The second major finding of this study was that the isolated plantation (Oruha) had lower species richness and stem density than plantations located adjacent to natural forest. While only one isolated plantation was available to study and variability found among Kibale plantations suggests that extrapolating findings from one plantation to another must be done with caution, the results point to areas where future work is needed. Furthermore, these results are comparable to results found by Tucker and Murphy (1997), although in their study, they detected differences due to isolation at around 500 m from forest and we were measuring isolation at \u03f37 km from forest.",
        "42ca8d6d-a98b-4130-b0ef-d96c60b22692": "In the current study, Kibale plantations had 5.5 times the native stem density and 2.0 times the native species richness of the isolated plantation at Oruha. These results can likely be attributed to the fact that animal dispersers inhabiting forests will often not enter disturbed areas such as pastures (da Silva et al. 1996, Bierregaard and Stouffer 1997, Tucker and Murphy 1997), and in fact in a month long study of terrestrial mammal abundance, wild mammals were 8.1 times more frequent in Nykatojo than Oruha (Zanne et al., in press). Thus, Oruha may be visited less by seed dispersers than Kibale plantations due to habitat barriers such as agricultural land. The isolation effect is supported by the fact that a greater percentage of species established in Kibale plantations were animal dispersed, while a greater percentage of species established in Oruha and the grassland were legumes. In fact, no large-seeded animal-dispersed species grew in Oruha or the grassland. Large-seeded species tend to be more limited in abundance by infrequent dispersal events than small-seeded species (Hardwick et al. 1997, Tucker andMurphy 1997). The impoverished tree communities in the grassland and Oruha suggest that forest recovery on isolated lands will be very slow. Results from this study suggest that strategies such as intercropping plantations with desirable native species especially dispersal-limited large-seeded species (Tucker and Murphy 1997) or species that attract a variety of seed dispersers, such as, Ficus (Parrotta 1995, Thornton et al. 1996) may accelerate reforestation in isolated plantations. Dispersal-limited species could mature and become seed sources for those species within the plantation. Species, such as Ficus, that are attractive to a large number of seed dispersers (Thornton et al. 1996) could attract more dispersers to the plantation and increase seed rain.",

The density of understory plants is a third major factor that influenced tree regeneration in this study. It might be expected that understory plants found in plantations and commonly eaten by seed dispersers (e.g., A. mala) would act as focal points for seed deposition. In Kibale, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are an important seed disperser and 42.9% of chimpanzee dung samples contained A. mala (Wrangham et al. 1994). Besides A. mala seeds, these samples contained various tree species (e.g., Uvariopsis congensis, Annonaceae; Mimusops bagshawei, Sapotaceae). Since chimpanzees travel through Kanyawara pine plantations (Zanne et al., in press) and disperse seeds from \u03f330% of the species found within the plantations, they could be an important seed disperser to plantations. However, in the current study, understory plants (such as A. mala) were negatively correlated with tree species richness and stem density. Understory plants have been documented to inhibit forest succession by restricting access to water, sunlight (Walker 1994), or nutrients (Corlett 1991, Ashton et al. 1997), by physically blocking growth (Cohen et al. 1995, Hardwick et al. 1997), and/ or by allelopathy (Otsamo et al. 1996). In Costa Rica, Powers et al. (1997) found that grass/fern cover was negatively correlated with species richness and density of woody stems. In the current study, while trees grew at low densities in dense patches of understory plants, these understory plants may still attract potential seed dispersers increasing seed deposition in plantations. Seedling establishment may be higher within plantations outside dense patches of understory plants, but if so this effect occurred at a larger spatial scale than measured (100-m 2 plots).",
        "c484eb38-d3ff-46dd-801d-40eb892a41db": "Finally, while most studies of regeneration of indigenous trees in plantations have shown an increase in species richness and stem density in plantations vs. unmanaged grasslands, only a few studies have documented variation between different plantations located in the same region. In the current study, species composition and stem density were highly variable among Kibale pine plantations. For example, Teclea nobilis stem density was much higher in Butanzi than any of the other Kibale plantations (Butanzi density \u03ed 102.3 times Nykatojo density, 12.8 times Kanyawara density, and 5.0 times Nyamusika density), and no T. nobilis stems were present in the isolated Oruha plan- tation. This variability may be due to many factors that differ among the plantations (e.g., differences in plantation size or shape). Heterogeneity (e.g., species composition) in the surrounding natural forest may be important as it may determine which and how frequent dispersers move through different plantations and the nature of the seed sources. While forest directly surrounding plantations was not quantified, this forest does show some heterogeneity; adults of species, such as Uvariopsis congensis, occur in high density stands in some areas in the forest but are nearly absent in other parts. In an Australian study, variation between plantations in regeneration levels was attributed to increasing diversity in adjacent forests (Tucker and Murphy 1997). The observed variation in regeneration among pine plantations in Kibale suggests that extrapolations about forest regeneration based on data from one or a few plantations may not reflect regeneration in other plantations. For example, if species composition were estimated only in Nykatojo, the species A. grandibracteata would have been the most common regenerating species (229 stems/3000 m 2 ), but A. grandibracteata is not among the top two most common species in any of the other three plantations.",
        "d09680b4-41ab-4327-8fdf-ea14e8fc96fc": "In fact, Kanyawara has only 13 A. grandibracteata stems per 3000 m 2 . In the other three plantations, small-seeded animal-dispersed species (C. durandii or D. abyssinica) are the most common species. In summary, this study found plantations facilitated understory forest regeneration over levels found in unmanaged grasslands. Thus in some situations, plantations can act as nurse crops for reestablishing forest cover. This investigation contributes information about important physical and biological characteristics influencing indigenous species richness and stem density within a plantation's understory. Increasing distance from plantation edge, isolation from seed sources of native species, and dense understory plant abundance all negatively affected forest regeneration. Variability in species composition, species richness, and stem density was high among plantations. Plantations will accumulate more stems and species when established ad-jacent to natural forest or older plantations already with established regeneration than isolated from forest. These results suggest that plantations established around natural forest as buffer zones, for example, may facilitate high levels of indigenous species establishment in their understories. The success of restoration using plantations will depend not only on location but also on time frame. The speed at which plantations begin facilitating regeneration is unclear from this study as only 30-yr-old plantations were studied; it would be expected that these effects would begin as soon as the pines could outcompete the grasses. Determining the time that plantations become beneficial to regeneration would be useful and would be expected to occur within years to a few decades. Future studies should determine if regenerating trees can survive extraction of planted pine trees and form a closed forest canopy. If forest trees are able to establish in the pine understory but are unable to survive pine extraction, applications of this management scheme would be limited to using pines as facilitators that are left to die in place.",
        "b2601166-56a7-4286-ac0c-a42de2aeb3e1": "Chapman and Chapman (1996) found a trend for greater tree regeneration in unlogged versus logged plantations of P. patula, P. caribaea, and Cupressus lusitanica in Kibale National Park two years after logging, but two years is perhaps insufficient to evaluate regeneration success given that successional processes occur over a much longer time frame. This study assessed when plantation establishment is recommended from a biological perspective. However, our research in Uganda led us to realize that other factors (e.g., social and economic) may be very important in determining success of a reforestation project. For instance, in Uganda, grasslands at Oruha hilltop were used originally as public land for growing crops. When the Forest Department established plantations at this location, local access to these lands was restricted. Such impacts on local users need to be taken into consideration. A study in the Philippines suggests that reforestation projects had increased success when they were viewed by local people as economically beneficial to them, were made compatible with local resource use and land tenure, incorporated local knowledge and skills, recruited the support of local social groups and organizations, and were compatible with local policies and political factors (Walters 1997). Further, the use of plantations as nurse crops may be limited because of the costs of plantation establishment. Most studies of plantations that foster understory tree regeneration were established for other purposes (e.g., industrial). Understory regeneration competes with plantation species, so an understory has been allowed to flourish only in failed or small experimental plantations. Researchers have shown that in some situations it is biologically possible to use plantation species as nurse crops for increasing tree diversity and However, because studies have been conducted primarily on these failed plantations, researchers have yet to show whether it is financially feasible to establish such plantations (Kosonen et al. 1997).",

If establishment costs are financially, economically, or socially high in areas such as public lands, then use of plantations as nurse crops may be restricted to situations such as occurred within Kibale, where public land use is limited and the goal of the park is to promote forest diversity. While future studies should focus on biological aspects, such as fire exclusion, and which species and harvesting practices facilitate forest reestablishment, these studies need to be conducted in plantations designed for the purpose of encouraging forest regrowth. Furthermore, future studies need to consider potential biological benefits of plantations in conjunction with social, economic, and financial aspects.",

Due to different economic and social reasons, more and more land became and will become abandoned in the (European) Mediterranean area (Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, 2010;Garc\u00eda-Ruiz and Lana-Renault, 2011;Lasanta et al., 2017). Under semiarid Mediterranean climate and less favourable soil conditions this process is hampered, and thus the bare soil remains prone to degradation (Geeson et al., 2003;Romero-D\u00edaz et al., 2017). Together with the typical highly variable inter-annual rainfall amounts and intensities in this region, this leads to a considerable loss of fertile soil (Bracken et al., 2008;Mart\u00ednez-Mena et al., 2001). The practice of planting late-succession species has been implemented for reducing the amount of erosion and overland flow on bare and degraded lands. For instance, since the beginning of the 20th century the practice of afforesting abandoned and degraded rangelands has been conducted on the Iberian Peninsula (Ortigosa et al., 1990;Vallejo, 2005), but is also implemented in other dryland areas in the world such as the Chinese Loess plateau, Central USA and in the Mediterranean climate region of Australia (Hoogmoed et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2013). Afforestation has been primarily seen as land degradation mitigation measure, but the focus shifted towards carbon storage and soil rehabilitation in the last decades (Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2018). Soil quality is a widely used term to describe the proper functioning of the soil and is mostly expressed by studying its (individual) indicators soil organic carbon (SOC) or soil organic matter (SOM) (Armenise et al., 2013;Masto et al., 2008).",

The C:N:P stoichiometry is a comprehensive indicator of soil nutrient status and the imbalance of elements induced by vegetation growth/ succession (Zhang et al., 2018). Aggregate stability of soil macroaggregates is recognized as an important indicator on the capability of the soil to resist against erosional forces (Cammeraat and Imeson, 1998). The effectiveness of afforesting abandoned agricultural fields and degraded rangelands under (semi-) arid condition as a soil restoration measure is still an important point of discussion (Cortina et al., 2011;Garc\u00eda-Franco et al., 2014;Maestre and Cortina, 2004;Ruiz-Navarro et al., 2009). However, a comparison with secondary succession has hardly been made in these discussions. As mentioned earlier, secondary succession is mostly hampered under semiarid climate conditions. This means that vegetation composition and cover develops non-linearly over time. Subsequently, soil quality develops also non-linearly, whereby substantial setbacks can occur over time (Bonet, 2004;Lesschen et al., 2008;Lozano et al., 2014). It is therefore important to understand the non-linear behaviour of the ecosystem dynamics to improve the decision making of when and where to invest in restoration measures (Sietz et al., 2017). This paper aims to contribute to the \"usefulness discussion\" on investments in afforestation as a re-greening measure in dryland ecosystems, from a soil quality perspective, in particularly when secondary succession is considered as an alternative. The main research question to be answered was: How does soil quality changes after afforestation or secondary succession on the decadal timescale?",

We sampled 149 stands from 6 to 41 years old, covering 101,800 km 2 , in Zhejiang Province, in China's eastern subtropical zone. The samples included four types of ESF: evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine (Pinus massoniana) forest, and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest. The mean values of biomass in evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine forest, and Chinese fir forest were 89.19, 70.06, 51.25, and 54.15 t ha \u00c01 , respectively. The NPP for the four types of ESF ranged from 4.41 to 8.35 t ha \u00c01 year \u00c01 . Carbon densities for the four types of ESF were lower than the mean values (36-57.07 t C ha \u00c01 ) for China because the ESFs are relatively young in Zhejiang Province. Overall, biomass, litter production, NPP, and carbon density were all significantly lower in pine forest and Chinese fir forest than in evergreen broad-leaved forest, whereas the values for the coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest were intermediate. These results suggest that the evergreen broad-leaved forest has great potential for offsetting CO 2 emissions, and that promoting succession from coniferous forests to evergreen broad-leaved forest can enhance carbon sinks in the forests of subtropical China. The next 50 years (as these forests mature) will represent an important period to enhance the carbon sink in Zhejiang Province.",

Thus, enhancing carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, and especially in forests, will be a key factor in the maintenance of the atmosphere's carbon balance. Though not required by the Kyoto Protocol, China has planned to reduce carbon emissions, and determining how to increase the country's carbon sequestration capability will be an important issue in regional carbon budgets (IGBP Terrestrial Carbon Working Group, 1998;Liu and Diamond, 2005). During the last two decades or so, many studies have estimated regional carbon storage and national carbon budgets of forests in many countries and regions, including Europe (Murillo, 1997;Cannell and Milne, 1995;Kauppi et al., 1992;Eriksson, 1991), South America (Schroeder and Winjum, 1995a,b;Fearnside, 1999;Houghton et al., 2000;Behling, 2002;Chave et al., 2003), North America (Kurz et al., 1992;Turner et al., 1995;Kurz and Apps, 1999;Brown et al., 1999), Australia and New Zealand (Hollinger et al., 1993), the former Soviet Union (Vinson and Kolchugina, 1993;Krankina and Dixon, 1994), and China (Fang and Chen, 2001;Wang et al., 2001Wang et al., , 2002;;Ni, 2002;Zhao and Zhou, 2005). A few studies have also reported smaller-scale carbon budgets in areas such as Ontario (Peng et al., 2000;Liu et al., 2002b).",

Unfortunately, the carbon budget of the subtropical zone has received little attention until now. China's subtropical zone has several unique features, including: (1) a humid and warm climate, even though other regions at the same latitude around the world are extremely arid; (2) a long disturbance history and intensive human activity over large areas that have left almost no mature forest, especially in the eastern coastal region; (3) the most rapid industrialization in China during the past 20 years, especially in the eastern part of the country, but accompanied by the creation of large areas of young forest or rapid conversion of bare land in mountainous areas into forest; (4) the presence of evergreen broad-leaved forest, which differs significantly from other forests in terms of the carbon cycle. There are considerable uncertainties about the carbon budgets in the subtropical forests of eastern China despite several previous studies of forest carbon budgets for the country as a whole using forest inventory data (Fang and Chen, 2001;Wang et al., 2001) and processbased models (Cao et al., 2003). To date, no study has estimated carbon budgets of ecological service forest (ESF) in subtropical China. To minimize human disturbance and increase carbon storage by forests, a new type of forest management, ESF, is emerging in China. These forests provide ecological benefits and are not used for the production of tangible products such as lumber or fuelwood (Zhou and Yan, 2000). ESF is an environmentally beneficial strategy for providing many ecological services, including carbon storage, hydrology, soil conservation, purification of the atmosphere and preservation of biodiversity (Zhou and Yan, 2000). ESFs resemble the ''forest reserves'' in North America, which contrast with conventional commercial forest (CMF) in that no harvesting operations are allowed.",

There is an immediate need to accurately estimate carbon storage, describe the carbon cycle of ESFs, and develop a forest management strategy for increasing or maintaining carbon sequestration and forest productivity in these forests. We used the ESFs in Zhejiang Province as an example of quantifying total biomass, primary production, and carbon storage for ESFs in subtropical China. We analyzed four main types of ESF: evergreen broad-leaved forest (ESF-EF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (ESF-MF), pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) forest (ESF-PF), and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) forest (ESF-CF). We compared these forests with similar commercial forests to understand the influence of this new form of forest management on regional carbon storage, and how to enhance carbon storage for ESF through forest management. The objectives of this paper are thus to: (1) examine the biomass, litterfall, and soil carbon stock for ESFs in Zhejiang Province based on detailed investigations of sample plots, and use these data to evaluate the contribution of ESFs to regional carbon sequestration; (2) compare carbon sequestration by ESFs with that of similar CMF in terms of biomass, net primary production, and carbon storage; and (3) explore the potential carbon sequestration after ecosystem restoration, and compare the two management types (ESF and CMF) to identify appropriate management approaches and strategies for enhancing long-term carbon sequestration by ESFs.",

The results showed that surface soil (0~25 cm) organic carbon content and soil organic carbon density had significant difference (P < 0.01) among the six different land use patterns. Soil organic carbon content and density were characterized by the descending order as: Natural forest (26.67\u00b10.79 g\u2022kg -1 ) > Schima superba planted forest (21.1\u00b10.79 g\u2022kg -1 ) > Bamboo (20.9\u00b10.53 g\u2022kg -1 ) > Coniferous forest (15.65\u00b10.93 g\u2022kg -1 ) > Orchard (15.22\u00b10.61 g\u2022kg -1 ) > Abandoned land (8.69\u00b10.38 g\u2022kg -1 ), and Natural forest (67.16\u00b12.31 kg\u2022m -2 ) > Bamboo (60.08\u00b11.53 kg\u2022m -2 ) > Schima superba plantation (52.8\u00b11.86 kg\u2022m -2 ) > Coniferous forest (47.17\u00b12.66 kg\u2022m -2 ) > Orchard (43.03\u00b11.56 kg\u2022m -2 ) > Abandoned land (31.48\u00b11.2 kg\u2022m -2 ), respectively.

Among them, the forest soil carbon pool accounts for 73% of the global soil carbon storage, making it the most important part of the global soil carbon pool [2]. Soil organic carbon (SOC) refers to all organic material that contains carbon in the soil, including a variety of animal and plant residues, microbes and the products from decomposition and synthesis of all organic matter. The SOC content and its dynamic changes are important indicators to reflect soil quality [3], and it directly impacts on soil productivity and fertility [4]. Soil organic carbon density (SOCD ) refers to per unit area of soil organic carbon mass in a certain depth and its size is determined by the size of the SOC content and soil bulk density [2].Some scholars have found that significant differences existed in the SOCD under different land use patterns. In China the highest SOCD was found in meadow and forest vegetation, followed by bush, farmland, and grassland, the lowest was desert [5]. Different land use patterns affect soil properties by altering vegetation types, plant roots, and management practices. Reasonable land use patterns can improve soil biodiversity, soil fertility and soil structure, and increase soil resistance to the environmental change [6]. Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the main causes of global climate change and the carbon cycle, and also is the second most important human activity only to fossil fuel combustion to increase atmospheric CO 2 concentration [7]. Over the last decade, a great deal of research was carried out in different areas and different land use patterns for the SOC storage, soil respiration, soil carbon stability, as well as climate change and LUCC on SOC space-time dynamic effects [3,[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].

SOC content of the Natural forest is significantly higher than the other 5 land use patterns, due to less human interference, higher canopy density, more litter, larger input of the organic matter and slower decomposition rate of soil organic matter with the Natural forest, thus accumulating more soil organic matter [15]. SOC of the Abandoned land was remarkably lower than the other 5 land use patterns, for the reason that the Abandoned land is characteristic of more human interference, more exposed soil organic matter, and poorer soil structure. Meanwhile, cultivation also increased the number of soil microbes and enhanced their activities, thus facilitating the degradation of soil organic matter. Research has shown that the forest land transformed to orchard inordinately reduced SOC content in the low mountain areas of the subtropical red soil [25]. In this study, the Orchard crops is relatively sparse and the soil with frequent farming made the surface soil loose, which contributed to decomposition of soil organic matter and resulted in the SOC content of the Orchard lower than the Bamboo forest and Coniferous forest. Therefore, in this study area, the content of SOC was closely related with the land use patterns, and ultimately had an impact on soil carbon sink inputs. SOCD of the surface soil (0~25cm) under 6 different land use patterns varied in the order as: Natural forest > Bamboo forest > Schima superba planted forest > Coniferous forest > Orchard > Abandoned land. SOCD was closely related to SOC content and soil bulk density. With varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance, the SOCD losses were different. The Abandoned land had experienced strong human disturbances and mechanical disturbances, so it had the lowest SOCD value.",

The study was established in 1969 in a 20-year-old plantation, thinned to basal areas of 9, 16, 23, 30, and 37 m 2 ha \u03ea1 and rethinned three times. The objective was to determine the effect of stand density regimes on productivity, understory vegetation, aboveground carbon storage, and mortality caused mainly by Dendroctonus infestations. Results showed that without mortality, basal area and volume increments were not affected by thinning the plantation to 16 m 2 ha \u03ea1 from 37 m 2 ha \u03ea1 . With Dendroctonus actively attacking trees, the plantation could be thinned to 9 m 2 ha \u03ea1 without sacrificing volume increment, because the level of mortality increased with stand density index. The thinning intensity did not affect the abundance of understory vegetation but did affect the cover of understory trees and graminoids. Intensively managed plantations could sequester and store the same amount of carbon as less intensively managed plantations. However, because fire is a major component in a pine-dominant ecosystem, carbon in larger diameter trees would be more resilient to wildfire than carbon in small diameter trees or understory vegetation.

In this study, in situ soil respiration was monitored in a typical land-use sequence on a ridge slope in Wangdonggou watershed of the Loess Plateau, China, during a three-year period from 2011 to 2013. The land-use conversion sequences included cropland (control), apple orchard, grassland, and woodland. The results clearly showed that soil respiration and temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ) varied significantly with land-use conversion. Soil respiration was decreased by 10% after conversion of cropland to orchard, and increased by 7-46% after conversion of cropland to grassland and woodland. Q 10 was increased by 19% after conversion of cropland to woodland, and decreased by 9-26% after conversion of cropland to grassland and orchard. Soil respiration increased linearly with soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and fine root biomass (<2 mm). The results indicated that root biomass and SOC storage were the major factors influencing Q 10 after conversion of cropland to non-natural ecosystem, and substrate quality or root system adaptability may be the real reason for the difference in Q 10 after conversion of cropland to natural grassland ecosystem. Although soil temperature and moisture significantly influenced soil respiration among the four typical land-use types, their difference derived from land-use conversions could not well explain the difference in soil respiration among land-use conversions. In conclusion, the increases in SOC storage and fine root biomass were the major factors influencing soil respiration among land-use conversions. Thus, conversion of cropland to natural grassland seemed to be the most effective integrated small watershed management to increase soil carbon storage and decrease CO 2 concentration in the loess regions of China.",

Land area globally affected by soil erosion is 1643 million ha, and erosion-induced CO 2 emission is 0.8-1.2 PgC year \u00c01 (Lal, 2003). Land-use conversion plays an important role in soil erosion, SOC and soil respiration in the erosion-degraded areas (Lal, 2001;Rey et al., 2011;Shi et al., 2014). The vegetation changes resulting from land-use conversions could directly affect soil physicochemical and microbiological properties, and impact the ability of soil respiration (Frank et al., 2006;Iqbal et al., 2008Iqbal et al., , 2010;;Raich and Tufekcioglu, 2000;Sheng et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2013a) and SOC content (Chang et al., 2011;Deng et al., 2013). In recent years, considerable effort has been made to understand the influence of the conversion of native forest to cropland or grassland in tropical and subtropical regions (Adolfo Campos, 2006;Fernandes et al., 2002;Sheng et al., 2010) and in temperate regions (Arevalo et al., 2010). Some other studies have also investigated the influence of the conversion between woodland and grassland in temperate regions (Smith and Johnson, 2004;Wang et al., 2013). However, to our knowledge, few studies have focused on the conversion of cropland to woodland or grassland in degraded ecosystems (Rey et al., 2011;Shi et al., 2014).

To address this problem, an integrated management of small watershed has been practiced since 1980s in an attempt to convert cropland to woodland or grassland in the Loess Plateau, leading to a significant improvement in the ecological environment, soil productivity, and household income level (Chang et al., 2011;Deng et al., 2013;Ping et al., 2013;Zheng and Wang, 2013). Therefore, the typical land-use sequence, including cropland, apple orchard, grassland, and woodland with a clear land-use history in this region provides a unique opportunity to study the ecological restoration processes following land-use conversion. Soil respiration varies significantly with land-use conversion (Frank et al., 2006;Iqbal et al., 2008Iqbal et al., , 2010;;Raich and Tufekcioglu, 2000;Sheng et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2013a).

Land-use conversions inevitably influence the input of organic matter and soil carbon source (Lee et al., 2013;French et al., 1979).

During the process of afforestation, the above and belowground ecosystems change at the same time, leading to improvement of soil conditions (Ren et al., 2017). Plants fixe carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere and input them into the soil subsystem by means of litter and root exudates (Wang et al., 2009). Conversely, plant growth will inevitably be affected by the transformation of organic substrates and release of mineral elements, and limited by any shortage of mineral nutrients in the soil (Zhang et al., 2016), which will further influence the succession of plant communities. Therefore, understanding the dynamic changes of soil nutrients and the related ecological processes is essential for human beings to predict vegetation restoration status and soil conditions. Afforestation has a huge potential to change ecosystem structure and processes that would further influence the physicochemical properties of the soil (Deng et al., 2014;Ren et al., 2016a). For example, soil water content (SWC) increases after afforestation, but soil bulk density (SBD) and pH decreases (Prietzel and Bachmann, 2012;Ren et al., 2016b). A large number of studies have also revealed that artificial forests that are based on former arable lands significantly increased the content and storage of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) (Deng et al., 2016;Li et al., 2016;Prietzel and Bachmann, 2012;Ren et al., 2016b;Zhao et al., 2015a). The C:N:P stoichiometry, which reflects the relationship between soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, has been widely used to determine the dynamic changes in soil mineral elements (Fanin et al., 2013;Zhao et al., 2015a).",

Furthermore, Ren et al. (2016b) revealed that P limitation occurred with the imbalanced increase of C, N, and P during afforestation by examining changes in C:N:P stoichiometry in the soil and microbial biomass. Therefore, it is important to better understand the characteristics of C:N:P stoichiometry during afforestation processes for the assessment of soil nutrient status and sustainable development of artificial forests. The evidence has indicated that microbial biomass and enzymatic activities of soil increased synergistically with planting years and hence could be regarded as indicators for evaluating soil quality (Lucas-Borja et al., 2016;Yuan and Yue, 2012). It is well known that soil biological (microbial and enzymatic) activities are highly correlated with soil physicochemical properties, and also participate in the metabolism of organic matter (Gispert et al., 2013), thereby affecting soil nutrient availability, accumulation, and mineralization (Zhang et al., 2016). Afforestation has the potential to shift belowground microbial communities and this alteration could modify soil physicochemical properties (i.e., SOC, TN, SBD, and SWC) (Ren et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2014;Yuan and Yue, 2012). Previous studies have shown that soil microbes can adjust their elemental use efficiencies to suit different resource components (Zechmeister-Boltenstern et al., 2015). This leads to changes in soil C:N:P stoichiometry through the decomposition of litter and roots (Fanin et al., 2013) and the synthesis of soil compounds (Lucas-Borja et al., 2016). Ren et al.",

Yuan and Yue (2012) showed that soil enzymatic activities are highly correlated with microbial biomass and activity because they catalyze biochemical reactions and elemental cycling in the soil. For instance, soil urease (URE) activity is closely related to soil N mineralization and N cycling, whereas soil phosphatase enzyme activity participates in the metabolism and transformation of P (Adamczyk et al., 2014). Moreover, afforestation has been considered to be the most significant driver of changes in microclimatic conditions (moisture, illumination, and temperature) (Zhao et al., 2015a), which stimulates microbial and enzymatic activities in the soil, thereby resulting in the unbalanced increase in soil nutrient content (An et al., 2013). The previous studies have also reported that the relationships between C:N:P stoichiometry and enzymatic activities of different functions responsible for C, N, and P mineralization and balance are very close (Sinsabaugh et al., 2009;Xu et al., 2017). In conclusion, this interaction between the soil physicochemical properties and its biological characteristics may be an important key to revealing the processes and mechanisms of restoration of plantation ecosystems (Adamczyk et al., 2014). Thus, an understanding of knowledge of various physicochemical properties and biological activities of soil during different restoration chronosequences could help us comprehend the essential variations in soil nutrient status driven by afforestation and properly protect the ecological environment. However, the relationship between microbiological properties, enzymatic activities, and nutrient content of the soil is still not fully understood in forest ecosystem, especially in the Loess Plateau of China (LPC).

The Ziwuling Mountains, one of the largest forest-covered area in the LPC, make a prominent contribution to controlling soil erosion and regulating climate in northwest China (Kang et al., 2014). The Pinus tabulaeformis exhibits a high survival rate, strong adaptability, and drought resistance, and consequently has been widely cultivated and occupies 81% of the total area of plantation forests in Ziwuling (Yuan and Yue, 2012).

Thus, assessing the substrate quality and decomposition dynamics of litter can provide a framework for expounding the nutrient feedback processes in a plantsoil system and the nutrient balance of afforestation ecosystems (Garc\u00eda-Palacios et al., 2016;Horodecki and Jagodzi\u0144ski, 2017). It is well known that changes in substrate quality are important factors that affect and change the soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents, because litter nutrients are directly and proportionally supplied to the soil (Xu et al., 2013). For instance, leguminous plants can boost soil N content faster than other plants due to their large litter nitrogen content (Horodecki and Jagodzi\u0144ski, 2017;Mueller et al., 2012), and soil and litter C:N:P stoichiometry are highly coupled in tropical forest plantations (Marichal et al., 2011). Delgado-Baquerizo et al. (2015) also demonstrated that litter N and P contents had significant correlations with soil N and P increments, but not with labile C variables. However, Phillips et al.",
        "da629bcb-3ad3-4b9a-87e9-b38e073ebc7c": "However, Phillips et al. (2011) found that plants had a greater effect on the availability of soil organic C relative to N and P. Thus, large uncertainties remain concerning nutrient balances in plant-soil systems, especially the C interrelationship between soil and litter, which need to be further verified in other regions. In addition to the direct return of C, N, and P to soil, the litter substrate quality can also influence the litter decomposition rate (LDR), and thus radically determine soil nutrient cycling and fluxes (Pena-Pena and Irmler, 2016). For instance, litter with a higher N content tends to contain more labile complexes (e.g., phenolic acids and flavonoids), which are usually easily accessed by decomposers, and thus can be quickly decomposed (Garcia-Palacios et al., 2016). Parsons and Congdon (2008) observed that the LDR had a significant positive correlation with the litter total nitrogen (LTN) and phosphorus (LTP) concentrations, but was negatively correlated with the cellulose and lignin contents. Previous studies have also shown that the litter N:P ratio, reflecting the N and P utilization efficiency of litter decomposers, appears to be a crucial determinant of LDR (G\u00fcsewell and Verhoeven, 2006;Gusewell and Gessner, 2009), whereas others have shown that litter with lower initial C:N ratio decays faster (Cornwell et al., 2008;Horodecki and Jagodzi\u0144ski, 2017;Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2000). Although these studies provided valuable recommendations for understanding the effect of substrate quality on litter decomposition, there is still necessary to broaden detailed researches since these conclusions remain divisive, especially which C:N:P stoichiometry can indicate the decomposition dynamics of litter.",
        "fdc650c6-478e-4f5b-b7c5-3a424697d42a": "Environmental conditions such as climatic factors (i.e., moisture and temperature) and soil characteristics (i.e., pH, soil bulk density [SBD], and soil texture) have been found to be closely related to litter decomposition, and thus affect soil nutrient contents (Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2015;Pena-Pena and Irmler, 2016;Pii et al., 2015), because they can modify the reproduction and growth of decomposers (microorganisms) (Fanin and Bertrand, 2016;Mueller et al., 2012). For instance, Serna-Chavez et al. (2013) reported that the soil temperature (ST) and moisture level influenced changes in the soil microbial biomass and diversity, affecting litter decomposition. Other studies showed that soil pH and SBD not affect only microbial community dynamics and respiratory characteristics, but also soil enzyme activities; thus, they also affect the litter decomposition process (Batty and Younger, 2007;Zhang et al., 2018). Furthermore, changes in environmental factors may affect the substrate quality of litter, such as the LTN and LTP concentrations, and fundamentally influence the nutrient return between plants and soil (Pena-Pena and Irmler, 2016;Zhong et al., 2017). In summary, these studies provided valuable knowledge of the response of litter decomposition to environmental factors, but there is no unanimous conclusion as to which environmental factors better reflect the LDR (Zhong et al., 2017); therefore, this topic needs further analysis. The Loess Plateau of China, characterized by severe soil erosion and desertification, is the most degraded and fragmented ecosystem in the world (Shi and Shao, 2000). To control soil erosion and rehabilitate the degraded ecosystem, the Chinese government has launched the Grain to Green Program to transform croplands (with slopes > 25\u00b0) into woodlands or grasslands (Deng et al., 2016a;Zhao et al., 2015b).",
        "1f5202d7-b2f4-4f33-8272-d484b53ad121": "Through decades of effort, a variety of vegetation types with different afforestation ages have been formed here (Zhang et al., 2011). The restoration of vegetation has effectively promoted net primary productivity, and reduced the disturbance caused by anthropogenic activities, which have enabled the improvement of aboveground and belowground ecosystems (C. Zhang et al., 2016a). During the shift in land-use types and afforestation age, the environmental factors and substrate quality must be modified (Ren et al., 2016a), leading to differences in the speed and quantity of nutrient return (Zhang et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2018;X.X. Zhang et al., 2016b). Variations in the soil physical and chemical characteristics, enzymatic activities, microbial biomass and diversity, and C:N:P stoichiometry during afforestation have been estimated by previous studies (An et al., 2013;Fu et al., 2000;Ren et al., 2017;Zhao et al., 2015a), but information about the effects of land-use types and afforestation age on litter decomposition and soil nutrient dynamics, and their relationship with substrate quality and soil environmental conditions, is still scarce. Such knowledge is important for understanding the essence of nutrient recycling, and for the suitable management and protection of restored ecosystems. In this study, we hypothesized that the soil nutrient status and litter characteristics change synchronously during afforestation, and that both processes vary with land-use type and afforestation age. In addition, we assumed that litter decomposition is influenced by litter substrate quality and environmental factors, especially the LTN, litter N:P ratio, soil water content (SWC), and soil pH. Moreover, we predicted that C:N:P stoichiometry can be used to evaluate the relationship between soil nutrients and litter properties, especially the N:P ratio.",

        "99e81c65-149d-4d83-8b80-881fa19ced2d": "Mountain ecosystems are important for their distinct ecological features and the ecosystem services they offer such as regulating atmospheric composition and providing climate change mitigation via carbon (C) sequestration (MAES 2014, Ward et al. 2014). Under contemporary global change with widespread abandonment of agricultural lands and massive afforestation activities mostly in the last century, as well as the expected increase in summer temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, C storage patterns likely will change in various compartments of mountain ecosystems. Spatial variability of organic matter stocks and turnover in different types of ecosystem depend on many factors (air temperature, aboveground vegetation composition, soil type, soil moisture regime etc. - Kammer et al. 2009, Lagani\u00e8re et al. 2013). Mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental changes (K\u00f6rner & Paulsen 2004). A recent report in Europe highlights the fragility and vulnerability of mountain areas (EEA 2013), and projects that both climate and land-use changes (LUC) will have profound effects on their services and functioning. In addition, climate change impacts interact with LUC in mountains (Spehn et al. 2006, Tasser & Tappeiner 2009). These changes are expected to affect many services that mountains provide, including C sequestration (Preston & Schmidt 2006, Lagani\u00e8re et al. 2010, 2013). Environmental degradation, including soil C loss caused by inappropriate land use, is a worldwide problem that has fostered research into sustainable production systems (Zink & Farshad 1995, Hebel 1998, Vagen et al. 2006, Khormali & Nabiollahi 2009). Land-use changes influence the bal-ance of soil organic carbon (SOC) and hence may cause CO2 emissions or C sequestration (Poeplau & Don 2013). In recent years, numerous studies have focused on SOC changes in various ecosystems (Powlson 2005, Kilic et al. 2012, Wiesmeier et al. 2012).",
        "73367dc5-4460-4441-88ee-67fa569e0917": "2012, Wiesmeier et al. 2012). Nevertheless, Poeplau & Don (2013), showed that in Europe different forms of land use and LUC can lead to either C loss or C accumulation in soils, and emphasized the lack of studies covering all major LUC and biomes with respect to qualitative and quantitative LUC effects. Soil quality plays an important role in sustainable land management and for environmental integrity. During the recent decades, soil quality concepts have emerged and have been used to assess land or soil quality for various ecosystems (Karlen et al. 1997, Lima et al. 2006). Changes in land use and land management have great effects on the direction and degree of changes in soil physical and chemical properties (Hulugalle et al. 1997). Land-use change obviously affects the cycles of C (Houghton 1999, Zhang 2010) and nitrogen (N -Potter et al. 1996) but also of soil potassium and phosphorus. Nitrogen is a key factor that influences the primary production of ecosystems (Mooney et al. 1987) but, on the other hand, is also controlled by land use and management practices (Yang et al. 2004, Wiesmeier et al. 2013). With continuous cultivation, physical soil properties may change and organic matter (OM) content, an important carrier of soil quality and storage compound for soil N, may decline (Lal 1986). An important factor for changes in OM content is the flux of plant residues, which is smaller in cropland compared with grassland or forest (Angers & Caron 1998, Schulze et al. 2009). Organic matter input rates also differ among land-use types owing to the different share of root-derived residues (Johnson et al. 2006, Wichern et al. 2008). Many studies have reported significant effects of LUC from cropland to forest and vice versa on soil C (Post & Kwon 2000, Guo & Gifford 2002).",
        "85fa29be-2753-467a-9615-410b5392ead8": "Conversion of a native ecosystem to cultivated land may cause changes in some soil properties, and often, long-term cropland management induces decreasing soil C stocks. The latter are caused not only by smaller residue inputs but also by less protection of soil C owing to physical disintegration of soil (Caravaca et al. 2004, Beheshti et al. 2012). Soil bulk density is the major discriminating factor in soil properties in relation to land use and management (Tisdall & Oades 1982, Zenga et al. 2014, Matano et al. 2015). Soil bulk density integrates effects of management and OM decline; these factors in conjunction result in smaller pore volumes and thus higher bulk densities. Celik (2005), for instance, showed that soil bulk density increased with cultivation relative to that of adjacent soils in forests and pastures in the southern Mediterranean highlands of Turkey. In Europe, grasslands at relatively low elevations and flat topography are more and more intensively managed, whereas less fertile pastures at higher altitudes are increasingly abandoned or actively converted into forests (EEA 2003). The area and management of mountain pastures are changing rapidly at national scale (ExAF 2010). Despite this rapid change, and in contrast to the vast literature on agricultural soils, only few studies have examined the effects of the long-term conversion from grassland or cropland on soil properties in mountain forest ecosystems (Skousen et al. 1998). Historical review on landuse in the mountain zones in Bulgaria showed that past forests have been threatened by excessive and improper use by the local population, which has led to replacement of typical tree species by others (Masarov 1940, Alexandrov 1994). In Bulgaria, afforestation is of high importance for mountain ecosystems, and substantial land conversion took place during the last decades to contrast erosion, to increase the treeline zone and to use low-productive areas. Our objective was to characterize soil properties and characteristics of aboveground vegetation in ecosystems of the Western Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria.",

Quantification of the contribution of this forest restoration program to carbon storage will provide critical information and guidance for designing future forest restoration and management strategies at the provincial level.The Guangdong Provincial Forest Inventory Database, together with our field sampling data was used to estimate carbon storage dynamics over the 10-year period of 1994-2003 for key restoration forest types as well as OBPA (open forest, bamboo forest, production forest and ambient trees). Various layers of forests were considered in calculating carbon storage: tree layers, understory vegetation and litterfall layers for the key forest types and bamboo forests; tree layers and litterfall layers for production forests; and only tree layers for open forest and ambient trees.Our results show that over the 10-year period, the reforestation program has increased total carbon storage by 41.67 Tg and forest carbon density by 1.58 Mg C ha \u00c01 . Carbon storage in tree layers was the greatest among all layers studied. Carbon storage in litterfall and understory layers amounted to approximately 38%-44% of the total carbon storage, demonstrating that litterfall and understory layers can not be neglected in estimating regional forest vegetation carbon storage in the sub-tropical forests. It was determined that coniferous forests provided the greatest contribution to total carbon, followed by broadleaved forests, OBPA, and mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests in decreasing order of magnitude. Among all key forest types, stands of P. massoniana had the greatest amount of carbon storage (from 59.65 to 65.87Tg) while Albizia falcataria (Linn.) Fosberg forest stands had the lowest (from 0.05 to 0.37 Tg). Over the 10-year period, carbon storage pools in maturescent forests, mature forests and post-mature forests were on the increasing trend, while those in young forests and middle-aged forests were declining and relatively stable, respectively.",

        "2cae2490-8c6a-4ab3-97e4-53a8f2cd14b6": "Carbon (C) storage and fluxes in forest ecosystems have been the focus of research in recent years because of the role of CO 2 in global climate change (Davis et al., 2003). Forest ecosystems play an important role in influencing the global C cycle, because they store nearly two thirds of terrestrial C and have a larger carbon density (carbon mass per hectare) than any other land uses. Since forest ecosystems exchange large amounts of CO 2 with the atmosphere through photosynthesis and respiration, they have the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon in regrowth stages (Schimel, 2001). Estimates of temporal changes in forest vegetation carbon pools are useful for understanding carbon storage associated with forest changes or successions (e.g., Dixon et al., 1994;Birdsey et al., 1993;Grigal and Ohmann, 1992;Fang et al., 2001;Fang and Chen, 2001). However, many studies on forest carbon dynamics have been at local levels, targeted at specific forest types. There has been little research at a regional or provincial level mainly due to the difficulties in dealing with the www.elsevier.com/locate/foreco many types of forests involved at a large-scale level. This highlights an important need to conduct a forest carbon dynamics study at a provincial or regional level. Guangdong province, located in southern China, has a subtropical monsoon climate. With abundant moisture and heat, there is a high diversity of forest types and great forest growth potential in the province. Because of rapid economic development in Guangdong in the last few decades, many forest ecosystems have experienced various levels of deforestation and land use changes. These economic development driven disturbances have caused serious environmental problems such as severe soil erosion, loss of wildlife habitat and loss of forest cover. In order to reduce these environmental problems, the Guangdong provincial government launched a large-scale, 10-year reforestation program in the 1980s. Through implementation of this program, the forest coverage rate of the province increased from 26.",
        "b807d814-53b4-45c7-8132-90c537a2687d": "Through implementation of this program, the forest coverage rate of the province increased from 26. 2% in 1979, 30.0% in 1986, 50.1% in 1998 and 57.1% in 2003. It is expected that doubling of the forest coverage over the last two decades will have positive effects on the environment. Quantification of these impacts will be critical for the province to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and to provide important guidelines for designing future reforestation strategies. In addition to other projects evaluating the effectiveness of the reforestation program, there is a need to examine the impacts of the program on carbon storage and to understand how this carbon storage is influenced by different types of reforestation forests. There have been a number of studies in China on forest biomass carbon storage on a national scale (e.g., Fang et al., 2001;Wang et al., 2001;Zhao and Zhou, 2004;Zhou et al., 2000;Li et al., 2003;Liu et al., 2000) as well as at the local level (e.g., Guan et al., 1998;Zhang et al., 2002;Cao et al., 2002). These studies have been useful in expanding our understanding of forest vegetation carbon pools. However, none of them has dealt with long-term dynamics of forest carbon storage pools (temporal scales). In addition, full implementation of the Kyoto Protocol will eventually lead to the trading of carbon sink credits among regions and countries. An accurate estimate of net carbon sink increment for a region would become indispensable. In this study, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) forest carbon storage increases with reforestation; (2) understory vegetation and litterfall carbon pools are significant components in total carbon storage in sub-tropical forest ecosystems; and (3) different forest types have different carbon accumulation rates during re-growth stages."
