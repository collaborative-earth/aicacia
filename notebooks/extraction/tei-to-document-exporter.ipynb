       "Section(title='INTRODUCTION 1.1 Cluster computing', text='The last few years have been characterized by huge technological changes in the area of parallel and distributed computing. Today, powerful machines are available at low price everywhere in the world. The main visible line of such changes is the large spreading of clusters which consist in a collection of tens or hundreds of standard almost identical processors connected together by a high speed interconnection network [6]. The next natural step is the extension to local sets of clusters or to geographically distant grids [10]. In the last issue of the Top500 ranking (from November 2003 [1]), 52 networks of workstations (NOW) of different kinds were listed and 123 entries are clusters sold either by IBM, HP or Dell. Looking at previous rankings we can see that this number (within the Top500) approximately doubled each year. This democratization of clusters calls for new practical administration tools. Even if more and more applications are running on such systems, there is no consensus towards an universal way of managing efficiently the computing resources. Current available scheduling algorithms were mainly created to provide schedules with performance guaranties for the makespan criterion (maximum execution time of the last job), however most of them are pseudo-polynomial, therefore the time needed to run these algorithms on real instances and the difficulty of their implementation is a drawback for a more popular use. We present in this paper a new method for scheduling the jobs submitted to a cluster inspired by several existing theoretically well-founded algorithms. This method has been assessed on simulations and it is currently tested on actual conditions of use on a large cluster composed by 104 bi-processor machines from Compaq (this cluster -called Icluster2 -was ranked 151 in the Top500 in June 2003). To achieve reasonable performance within reasonable time, we decided to build a fast algorithm which has the best features of existing ones. However, to speed up the algorithm a guaranteed performance ratio cannot be achieved, thus we concentrate on the average ratio on a large set of generated test instances. These instances are representative of jobs submitted on the Icluster [18].')"
